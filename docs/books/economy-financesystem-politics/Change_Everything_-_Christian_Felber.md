## FOREWORD BY ANN
## PETTIFOR
The  common good is  widely understood as  that  which is  shared and
beneficial for the general welfare of a human community. Christian Felber’s
Change Everything: Creating an Economy for the Common Good – argues
persuasively that we must move to a state Aristotle defined as the healthy
oikonomia, in which money serves as a means for the “good life”, from the
unnatural chrematistike, in which multiplication of money becomes not just
an end in itself, but also the means for exercising dominium over the 99
percent.
Under the capitalist system of chrematistike, credit is the main driver of
economic expansion (defined by economists as “growth”) and consumption.
The  establishment,  over time of  a  system of  credit creation was  a
civilizational advance, and  is  a  great public good, because, as  Keynes
argued, it enables us “to do what we can do”. However, like the magic in
Goethe’s “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” it must be managed and regulated. In the
hands of  financial “apprentices” it  can  do  great harm. The  reckless and
deregulated proliferation of  easy,  but  costly money,  represents  a  great
danger to  the  common good. Speculators in  globalized capital markets,
detached from democratic regulation and oversight, have opened the spigot
of  the  “magic” that  is  easy credit  and  used it  to  fuel  global economic
expansion and the constant impetus to capital accumulation by the already-
rich. Consumption, in turn, gorges on fossil fuel extraction, accelerating the
growth of greenhouse gas emissions.
Deregulated credit  in  a  world of  mobile capital does not  just  fuel
consumption, it  also  fuels corruption, of  both the  political and  finance
sectors. Drug dealers, traffickers and gangsters engage in a global trade that
killed roughly 450,000 in 2015; a trade that has made them amongst the

wealthiest beneficiaries of  today’s  system of  unregulated, globalized,
mobile capital.
## 1
Credit is  presumed to  “grow”  exponentially as  private finance fuels
capitalism’s  ability  to  first, create society’s  new “wants”, what J.K.
Galbraith called our psychologically grounded desires:
...“wants” that do not “originate in the personality of the consumer”
but are “contrived by the process of production”.
## 2
Instead, and for the sake of the common good, we should be prioritizing
human needs –including the need for security at a time of not just climate
breakdown, but earth systems breakdown. While survival is the most basic
human need, all  people require  health and  autonomy for  effective social
participation. Autonomy of  agency requires mental health, cognitive
understanding and opportunities to participate – all essential to the universal
Green New Deal. Additional needs include: adequate nutritional food and
water; protective housing; non-hazardous physical and work environments;
security in childhood; significant primary relationships; physical security;
economic security; safe birth control and child-bearing; basic education. To
optimize these needs, argues Professor Gough,
## 3
societies require freedoms
from oppression (civic and political rights); freedoms to (rights of access to
need satisfiers) and political participation.
From the  perspective of  the  ecosystem, perhaps the  most damaging
aspect of  globalized, largely deregulated credit-creation is  the  finance
sector’s  demand for  high, real  rates of  return on  a  relatively effortless
process: the  creation of  new  money.  If  interest rates are  higher than  the
capacity of the earth, or the economy, to renew itself, then interest rates
become brutally extractive. Individuals that are obliged by low or falling
incomes to borrow, are driven to work long hours to raise the money needed
to repay the interest on debt. Firms cut costs and to exploit labour for longer
in order to raise the finance needed to service their debts. Governments strip
forests, fish seas and exploit the land to improve “efficiency” and generate
the returns needed to repay their obligations, including foreign debt service.
Scientists have made clear that  earth’s  and  therefore humanity’s  life
support systems  –  soils, aquifers, rainfall, ice,  the  pattern of  winds and
currents, pollinators, biological abundance and  diversity –  are  threatened

with complete breakdown. In so far as human communities depend for their
survival – not just their general welfare – on these life support systems, the
common good must now  embrace not  just  humanity,  but  nature in  the
widest sense of the word.
This is difficult for Western societies because for two thousand years or
more our  culture has  driven us  to  exercise “dominion” over  nature. As
Hugh Welchel of the Institute for Faith, Ethics and Economics writes:
In  Genesis 1:26-28 God  calls mankind, beginning with  Adam and
Eve, to exercise dominion over the earth, subdue it, and develop its
latent potential. We are called to fill the earth with his glory through
creating what we commonly call “culture”. The Hebrew word radah
in  this  passage carries the  idea  of  ruling, subduing, and  exercising
dominion.
Justin Holcomb argues that a correct definition of dominion does not mean
destruction, but responsibility:
A false view of dominion has played a role in the mistreatment of
creation, but  a  correct understanding of  the  concept can  lead  to
service, responsibility, and stewardship.
Indeed so,  but  to  transform a  culture from dominion to  service,
responsibility and  stewardship to  ensure the  common good, does mean
rolling back and disinterring a deeply entrenched view pervasive in Western
societies: that nature is subordinate to human interests and well-being. The
very opposite is the case: the very survival of humanity is dependent on the
life support systems provided by nature.
So this book is published at a critical time for human civilization. Are we
capable of undertaking a radical transformation of public attitudes, but also
of  our  economy and  ecosystem  –  a  transformation vital not  just  to  the
common good, but to human survival?
I am an optimist and believe that we can – because we have done so
before. How was  it  done? First, we  could not  imagine a  situation being
different. Then things changed and we couldn’t imagine going back to how
they were before.

As  an  example  the  Rapid Transition Alliance gives us  smoking –
promoted by an industry that knew about, but publicly denied, knowledge
of the fact that smoking killed millions of people. Largely thanks to the
work of scientists, transformation in the face of powerful corporate interests
was achieved – and relatively quickly.
The  Rapid Transition Alliance  reminds us  of  what happened quite
recently, when a volcano – Ejafjallajökull – erupted in the early hours of 14
April, 2010. Within hours airports all  over  Europe were closing.  It  was,
writes Andrew Simms, as if a giant master switch for the aviation industry
had been flicked to “off”. The fine dust thrown up by the volcano was lethal
to modern jet engines. For days Europe was grounded. One of the main
arteries of the modern world – cheap, ubiquitous air travel – was suddenly
cut.  It  was  also  a  glimpse of  a  future in  which climate breakdown, and
limited oil  supplies will  have clipped the  airline industry’s  wings. The
world did not come to a standstill. The sky didn’t fall. It revealed how life
would be  different without airlines: it  would go  on,  as  it  has  done for
thousands of years.
Finally,  the  arrival of  the  internet and  the  speed with which it  has
brought about an  extraordinary transformation in  communication and
information was not predicted, nor could we have imagined such change
was possible in so short a time.
So we know from our own experience that change can happen – fast.
Christian Felber is right: we can change everything to create an economy
for the common good.

## FOREWORD TO SECOND
## EDITION
I  am  writing these lines for  the  2nd  edition of  the  English  version of
Change Everything: Creating an  Economy for  the  Common Good  nine
years after the Economy for the Common Good (ECG) movement started in
October 2010 in  Austria. Since  then, the  movement has  spread to  all
continents. From the  USA to  South East Asia, from Scandinavia to
Patagonia, local chapters have emerged  and  begun working for  change.
More than  500  companies, but  also  municipalities and  universities have
completed their first, second, third or already fourth common good balance
sheet. Cities and  regions are  joining and  making first  steps  towards a
“common good city” or  a  “common good region”. Scientists from all
branches have offered their collaboration in  research, teaching, applied
sciences, and communication. The first ECG University Chair was created
at  the  University of  Valencia in  2017. Two  research projects on  applied
ECG have  been accomplished recently.  Already in  2015, the  European
Social and  Economic Committee has  approved the  ECG model with  86
percent of its votes recommending its inclusion in the legal framework of
the European Union and member states.
Nothing is  stronger than a  movement whose moment has  come.
According to  diverse surveys, up  to  88  percent (Germany) and  even 90
percent (Austria)  of  the  citizens desire a  new  economic order.
## 1
## New
movements such as Fridays for Future or Extinction Rebellion with new
protagonists such as Greta Thunberg or David Attenborough emerge and
express people’s  concerns creating momentum for  action. But  also  more
and  more business leaders are  increasingly critical of  the  predominant
economic model.  To  the  surprise of  many,  the  world’s  most  powerful
financial investor, Larry Fink from Blackrock, wrote in his New Year letter

2018 that a company must follow a “social purpose” alongside its financial
targets. Later in  the  same year,  Oxford professor Colin Mayer made the
same argument in his book Prosperity. He states that the modern company
has morphed into a “money monster”. Instead, companies should be “doing
well by doing good”.
## 2
Just a few months later, his colleague Paul Collier
advocated the ideal of “ethical firms“ in The Future of Capitalism.
It  appears to  me  that  Milton  Friedman’s  ideological leadership in
business-related bottom-lining is soon to be buried. The writing on the wall
is hard to ignore. John Elkington, the inventor of the “triple bottom line”,
admitted that  the  concept failed in  its  original goal  to  trigger a  system
change. “Clearly,  the  Triple Bottom Line has  failed to  bury  the  single
bottom line paradigm”, he  wrote in  June 2018.

Something more
transformative is needed. Something like the Doughnut Economy by Kate
Raworth. It is no coincidence that her book is disrupting economic thought
when not only the corporate model, but economic science as a whole is in
the  midst  of  a  fundamental crisis. A  few  years earlier,  Tim  Jackson
suggested uncoupling prosperity from GDP growth – and he was the first
one to be listened to with this proposal.
Contrary to Margret Thatcher’s “TINA” – There is no alternative – the
new slogan ist “TAMA”, there are many alternatives! Here is a short list of
some of  these: Transition Town,  commons, care  economy,  sharing and
collaborative economy,  ethical banks, B  Corps, cradle to  cradle,  circular
economy,  economic democracy,  local futures, eco-villages. All  of  these
indicate that there is strong momentum in the field of alternatives. All of
them align behind fundamental  values such as  human dignity,  solidarity,
justice, the  limitation of  inequality and  the concentration of  power,
transparency, democracy, and the protection of the environment and global
climate.
The  Economy for  the  Common  Good movement argues  that  we  need
more such values-based alternatives. When we started the Economy for the
Common Good the  first reactions were: “That’s  an  oxymoron, a
contradiction in itself”. This reflex shows how thoroughly our brains had
been washed by  Friedman, his  mentor Hayek, and  more Chicago Boys
concerning what the economy should be about. Step by step we have found
historical sources and created rock solid arguments that the common good
is  neither new nor  a  nice-to-have. It  has  been the  cornerstone of
contemporary democracies as well as of philosophical thinking about the

economy since the  ancient Greeks. Aristotle clearly distinguished two
concepts to define business activities: oikonomia on the one hand, which
aims at the well-being and good life for all members of the “household”
(oikos) in which money is just a means to help achieve the goal. If this
relation(ship) gets inverted, and money-making, or the increase of capital,
becomes the goal of business or artistic activities, then this by definition is
no  longer oikonomia,  but  its  opposite, chrematisiké.  The  latter literally
means “the  art  of  making money and  to  get  rich”. Today,  we  call  it
“capitalism”. Aristotle’s enlightened contribution was to define capitalism
(money is a goal) and oikonomia (money is a means) as opposites. After the
classics from Smith to  Mill, economic science has  perverted itself into
chrematistics,  and  is  no  longer aligned with oikonomia.  As  soon as  a
manager, researcher or theorist is more interested in return on investment,
financial profit and GDP, rather than human well-being and the common
good, he or she is not practising the economy or being an economist at all.
The  original “economy” is,  by  definition, an  economy for  the  common
good.
Researcher and author Claus Dierksmeier found that “from Aristotle via
Thomas Aquinas, up to and including Adam Smith, there was a consensus
that both economic theory and practice needed to be legitimated as well as
limited by a certain overarching goal (Greek: telos) such as the ‘common
good’”.
## 4
This is one of the most supportive statements on the subject I have
found.
Luckily,  some economists have been aware of  these differences and
perversions and they argued for a steady-state economy (Herman Daly), for
ecological economics (Joan Martínez-Alier), for  post-growth economics
(Serge Latouche), care economy (Riane Eisler), gift economy (Genevieve
Vaughan) doughnut economics (Kate Raworth), commons (Elinor Ostrom),
and others. Mainstream economist Jean Tirole wrote a book titled Economie
du bien commun in French. The fact that a mainstream economist links a
value with a science which has considered itself as value-free, is a signal for
a dawning paradigm shift. The revolution of economics in a broader sense
is well underway. In 2000, French students of economics started the “post-
autistic economics” movement. In  the  UK,  Rethinking Economics was
founded. At Harvard, a mass walk-out of Gregory Mankiw’s ECON class
showed the deep crisis in which mainstream economics has fallen. Globally,
the network for Pluralist Economics is growing. There are sparks of hope

everywhere that a great transformation will reform both economic thinking
and practice.
The  Economy for  the  Common Good (ECG) movement has  three
principal objectives:
1.laying the foundation for a new economic theory and teaching
## (education);
2.changing the practice of business (economy);
3.reforming the legal framework for the economy (politics).
Aligned with this  these three  strategic fields, our  movement itself is
threefold: 1. The model is a consistent theory of change, a new narrative
about the  economy; 2.  it  is  at  the  same time a  highly participatory
movement in  which every individual person, every company,  every city,
every school and every university can join; 3. it opens a perspective on how
to make fundamental decisions of economic policy more democratically.
For the latter, we developed an innovative understanding of democracy
that is not limited to voting for a political party every four years. The idea
of  a  “sovereign  democracy” is  the  twin-sister of  the  Economy for  the
Common Good and might become the catalyzer for its success. The idea is
that in a democracy the people are the sovereign, which means they “stand
above all”. Taken literally, this means that constitutions are exclusively in
the hands of the people. Thanks to sovereign rights, the people will be able
to make fundamental decisions on economic policy such as limiting the size
and power of corporations or capping income inequality. In a “democracy
game”, which we have played with audiences in over 25 countries, people
propose the  ratio at  which the  lowest and  the  highest paid  person in  a
company should be paid. Interestingly, the result almost everywhere was a
factor of  10  or  nearby.  These games have shown that  people across the
globe support that  inequality is  tolerated, but  that  the  highest incomes
should not be higher than 10 times the lowest incomes. Reality looks very
different. Currently  the  highest known incomes in  Germany are  80,000
times higher than the lowest and in the US some CEOs earn 360,000 times
more than minimum wage.
Since the original German edition of this book was published in August
2010 in  Austria, Change Everything: Creating an  Economy for  the

Common Good  has  been published in  12  languages, amongst others,
French, Spanish,  Italian, Polish and  Finnish. The  book’s  success is
paralleled by  the  success of  our  movement. In  September 2018, nine
national associations for the enhancement of the ECG – from Sweden to
Chile – took a joint step to found the international EGG federation which is
now the unified and unifying umbrella of the global movement. Since its
foundation less than ten years ago, the ECG movement is going global. On
a daily basis, top executives and business leaders are abandoning the “old
chrematistic” world, with its lack of meaning, ethics and humanity. They
are joining our movement, which aims at building a true “oikonomia”. You
are warmly invited to join, too. Be the change you want to see in the world!

## FOREWORD
Christian Felber thinks big. Not content with marginal change, he proposes
a thorough overhaul of our capitalist system. In his world, companies still
earn profits. But they are driven not by revenues and costs, but by their
Common Good balance sheet, which evaluates them on how cooperative
they are with other companies, whether their products and services satisfy
human needs, and how humane their working conditions are. A company is
awarded Common Good points accordingly, and its score is published, so
that customers know whom they are dealing with. A good score also entitles
the  company to  favourable government treatment: lower taxes, better
borrowing terms and more public contracts.
Could this world actually come about? I honestly don’t know. But I have
encountered such a society on a smaller scale. Thirteen years ago, I was
introduced to  the  Camphill movement, which builds communities where
disabled people live  together with their caregivers (my  son  lived at  a
Camphill school for six years). Like Christian’s utopia, these communities
place the highest value on cooperation, dignity and service. If they can do
it, perhaps Christian’s vision is not so far-fetched.

## PREFACE
TAPAS: There are plenty of alternatives
On 6 October 2010, a process of change began in Vienna: the Economy for
the  Common Good took its  first  step  towards turning an  idea  into  a
movement. It all began with a dozen Austrian enterprises; four years later,
the  list  of  supporters included some 1,700 enterprises  and 200
organizations. Schools and universities from different parts of Europe and
across the  entire Latin American  continent are  now  participating. Local
chapters (also known as “energy fields”) are being founded in more and
more countries, forming the backbone of the movement. Associations are
coordinating developmental tasks, and expert teams are giving support to
economic, political and cultural pioneers. The Economy for the Common
Good was instigated by the activist organization Attac Austria, which I co-
founded in 2000 and remained active in until 2014. In addition to teaching
duties at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, book-writing
and international lecture tours, I have since devoted my political energy and
creativity to building up an international Economy for the Common Good
movement and  establishing the  Bank for  the  Common Good project in
## Austria.
In  the  same week  when the  original German-language edition of  this
book came  out  in  August 2010, the  renowned Bertelsmann Foundation
published a survey which found that 88 percent of respondents in Germany
expressed the desire for a new economic order. In Austria, an even larger
proportion of the interviewees expressed this sentiment, namely 90 percent.
Just  imagine: 90  percent articulated a  conscious desire for  an  economic
model other than the currently prevailing one. This is surely unprecedented,
isn’t it? At lectures, audiences have given similar responses. More and more
people are  realizing that  we  are  not  currently experiencing an isolated

financial crisis; they  can  see  that  financial bubbles, unemployment and
various types of crises – income and wealth distribution, climate, energy,
hunger and  consumption, as  well as  crises of  meaning, values and
democracy –  are  all  inherently connected and symptoms of  a
comprehensive systemic problem. In the capitalistic market economy means
are confused with goals; a model which is devoid of meaning is becoming
obsolete.
And yet in part, the representatives of the people still claim “There is no
alternative”. This  dictum, uttered by  Margaret Thatcher,  is  still  popular
among a  powerful elite which  obstruct change. But  in  a  democracy
alternatives always  exist. One  of  the  main objectives of  this  book is  to
demonstrate, in  concrete terms,  that  there are  in  fact  alternatives to  the
current economic order.
The decisive question is: which direction should be taken? Should the
economy become  more ecological and  sustainable; should it  become a
“post-growth economy”? Should it  become more regional and  more
resilient on  the  basis of  bio-regions and  transition towns? Should the
welfare state be strengthened and inequality be limited as in the familiar
“social market economy”? Should the  focus move from competition to
cooperation in the name of a solidarity-based economy? Should priority be
given to human dignity and should every individual be granted the right of
co-determination to achieve a higher degree of economic democracy?
The response of the Economy for the Common Good is that all of these
values should be realized to a greater degree than they are today. And the
common denominator is  “the common good”. This concept was  not
invented by us; it stems from a long tradition. The term bonum commune
was coined by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century. Since then it has
run like a common thread through Christian social doctrine – and through
the constitutions of democratic states. German Basic Law states: “Property
entails responsibility.  Its  use  is  also  to  serve the  welfare of  the  general
public.” According to  Italy’s  constitution, “public and  private economic
activity should be  oriented to  the  common good”. The  Constitution of
Bavaria is  the  most unequivocal in  this  regard, stating: “All  economic
activity serves the common good.”
This was even the view taken in ancient Greece. Aristotle distinguished
between the healthy oikonomia, in which money serves as a means for the

“good life”, and  the  unnatural chrematistike,  in  which multiplication of
money becomes a means in itself.
## 1
What all great concepts have in common is their enormous attraction.
Various protagonists and regimes co-opt them for their own objectives and
interests. Hitler misappropriated the  concept of  the  common good, and
socialist dictatorships have taken possession of it as well. But that should
not preclude perpetuating what remains a coherent and apt concept. We do
not eliminate the concepts of “freedom”, “truthfulness” and “love” from our
vocabulary just because they get misused. The best concepts run the highest
risk of usurpation. And the more valuable a concept is, the more vehement
will be the wrangling about how to define it. This makes the democratic
deliberation necessary for promoting its realization all the more crucial.
## THE PROCESS OF PARTICIPATION – AN OPEN-ENDED
## DEVELOPMENT
Two  crucial questions pose themselves: what does the  “common good”
mean and  who  defines it?  As  a  guiding concept, the  Economy for  the
Common Good has no preconceived meaning except that it signifies how
important the well-being of all human beings and the natural world is. “The
greatest happiness for  the  greatest number of  people” –  this  utilitarian
principle which we are all familiar with falls short because the value, and
hence dignity, of all human beings is equal. The only immanent meaning of
the common good concept is that everyone’s well-being counts. Otherwise
the concept constitutes nothing more than an umbrella term in the sense of a
constitutional goal which sums up the key values of democratic societies.
The  precise meaning of  its  individual components can  and  should be
determined democratically. The “common good” is neither divinely handed
down nor  does it  derive from the  grace of  any  emperor.  This,  in  turn,
implies two things:
1.The conceptual cornerstones of the Economy for the Common Good
must be discussed by a large number of people in the course of a
comprehensive developmental process before they can be incorporated
into a clear-cut democratic process. What this essentially involves is
establishing a new economic order in democratic terms. The core

elements of the model outlined in this book do not constitute a final
result, but rather a point of departure for developing such a new order!
2.If the democratic process develops in accordance with our ideal notions,
several years from now directly elected economic conventions will have
drafted a section of the constitution concerning the economy, and the
population will have accepted it using an innovative voting procedure.
Needless to say, the model will continue to remain open-ended – for the
very reason that ongoing democratic renegotiation of our societal
“guiding light” forms the core of the common good.
## THREE KEY CONCERNS
The Economy for the Common Good has three major focuses:
1.It strives to dissolve the contradiction between those values held by
business and those held by society by finding ways to reward, in
business, the values that allow us to nurture interpersonal relationships.
These include the building of trust, mutual appreciation, cooperation,
connectedness with nature, solidarity and sharing.
2.The values and goals laid down in our constitutions should be
systematically implemented in business practices. The currently
existing economic order, which has been constituted by the system
itself, diametrically contradicts the spirit of many political constitutions
or parts thereof.
3.The approach to measuring economic success should move from
evaluating the means to assessing the goals of business, operating on
the premise that the purpose of all business is not to maximize profit,
but rather to promote the common good. In other words: exchange
values do not constitute the goal, use values do. Human beings derive
their means of subsistence from use values alone. Exchange values are
only useful indirectly, not inherently. Money can neither nourish me,
nor warm me, nor embrace me. The Economy for the Common Good
wants to measure what really counts. The Common Good Product
would replace the GDP, the Common Good Balance Sheet would
supplement the financial balance sheet, and the ethical return on

investment would displace the financial return as the primary parameter
of economic success.
One-sided measurement of  success in  terms of  monetary indicators has
played a major role in turning economics into a lifeless science. In my eyes
the Czech economist Tomáš Sedláček has found the best metaphor to date
for conveying what has happened to the field of economic science: “If the
soul  is  torn  out  of  an  organism, what remains is  a  zombie.”
## 2
## Classical
economics has no soul; hence it poses a great threat to a human, sustainable
society. We must breathe a soul into it again. This healing process would
begin with  the  act  of  re-embedding  the  economy into  our  cultural value
system, thus ending the ethical schizophrenia created by the chasm between
business and society. And it would go so far as to re-embed both economic
thought and practice into the planetary ecosphere.
## ONE ALTERNATIVE AMONG MANY
The  Economy for  the  Common Good does not  say  “This is  the  only
conceivable economic model for the future”. Rather it describes important
elements of an economic order: goals, values, success parameters, markets,
gainful employment, ownership, financial systems and others. It is neither
comprehensive nor  closed. In  fact  it  strives to  be  combined with other
alternatives and to be enriched by them. Classic “friends” of the Economy
for  the  Common Good are:  the  solidarity-based economy,  the  commons,
economic democracy,  B  Corporations, social business, shared value,
economic subsidiarity, the gift economy, and the post-growth economy, to
name but a few. It would not even be advisable for one model to assert itself
over all the others; instead it would be desirable to have the most appealing,
consensual components of  various alternative approaches combined in  a
participatory process in search of a democratic economic order.
In Great Britain much has already been accomplished in the direction of
exploring such alternatives. Schumacher College, the  New Economics
Foundation and the Findhorn Community are some of the beacons in this
alternative landscape. Tim Jackson and the Skidelskys are perpetuating the
pioneering endeavours of  E.  F.  Schumacher as  well as  those  of  the
American Herman Daly. One of the world’s largest enterprises owned by its

employees is  located in  Britain:  the  John Lewis Partnership. And the
publisher of this book, Zed Books, is a workers’ collective.
As of late 2014, this book was available in seven languages; in addition
to  this  English-language edition, publication of  Serbian- and  Dutch-
language versions  are  planned for  2015. Thus the  book will  soon be
available in  ten  languages and  can  finally be  distributed worldwide. In
addition to readers in Britain and the USA, people in countries extending
from Moldova to India and from Kenya to Canada have expressed interest
in an English-language version.
## THE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK
A  short  crisis analysis of  the  current economic (dis-)order is  given in
Chapter 1, followed in Chapter 2 by an extensive explication of the core of
the  Economy for  the  Common  Good. Chapters 3  and 4  deal  with the
financial system (the  “democratic bank”) and  property,  which  are  two
pillars of  the  Economy for  the  Common Good. Chapter 5,  entitled
“Motivation and  meaning”, addresses “softer” issues, exploring the
apprehension held by many that the incentive to perform would be lost in an
ethical market economy. Chapter 6 is devoted entirely to democracy. As I
maintain, the Economy for the Common Good can only be implemented
comprehensively in the framework of a direct and participatory democracy
which is more advanced than the current post-democracy. Chapter 7 shows
examples of  already-existing common-good-oriented enterprises and
activities. Chapter 8  sketches out  the  strategies of  the  four-year-old
movement and  reports on  its  current state of  development. The  book
concludes with two appendices: the first answers a larger series of FAQs
(frequently asked questions) raised by  hundreds of  people who have
attended lectures in  many countries; the  second contains a  20-point
summary, which could conceivably serve as a compendium for an economic
convention.
Participation in an economic convention is one of numerous possibilities
for contributing to an Economy for the Common Good. This book pursues
three objectives: (1)  It  strives to  offer  a  clear and  consistent full-scale
alternative to the prevailing economic order. (2) It sketches out a concrete
procedure of democratic implementation which leaves the model open for

combination and cooperation with other alternatives at the same time – in
keeping with the motto “There are plenty of alternatives!” (3) It offers each
and every person, each and every enterprise, each and every body politic
and  each and  every educational institution concrete and  low-threshold
possibilities for  participating in  and  shaping the  transition  to  a  new
economic order. Help us shape it!

## HUMAN VALUES – VALUES OF THE ECONOMY
It’s peculiar: although values are meant to offer basic orientation, serving as
the “guiding lights” of our lives, the values which hold for the economy
today are  completely different  from those which apply to  our  daily
interpersonal relationships. In  regard to  our  friendships and  everyday
relationships, we thrive when we live in accordance with human values: the
building of  trust, honesty,  esteem, respect, empathy,  cooperation, mutual
help and sharing. The “free” market economy is based on the rules of the
systematic pursuit of  profit and  competition. These pursuits promote
egoism, greed, avarice, envy,  ruthlessness and  irresponsibility.  This
contradiction is not merely a blemish in a complex or multivalent world;
rather, it is a cultural catastrophe; it divides us inwardly – as individuals and
as a society.
## VALUES ARE GUIDING LIGHTS
The contradiction is fatal because values are the foundation of communal
life. We set life goals and orient our actions according to them, investing
them with meaning. In Spanish the word “sentido” denotes meaning as well

as  direction. Values are  like  a  guiding light  which gives the  road  of  life
direction. But if our guiding light for daily life points in an ethical direction
– towards building of trust, cooperation, sharing – and suddenly, in a partial
realm of life, namely the market economy, a second “guiding light” points
in the opposite direction – in the direction of egoism, competition, greed –
then we are plagued by a terrible quandary: should we act in the spirit of
solidarity and  cooperation, help  each other and  always be  mindful of
everyone’s welfare? Or should we always look to our own advantage first
and short-change others as our competitors? The direness of the conflict lies
in  the  fact  that  legislators favour  the  false guiding light, thus  promoting
values that we all suffer from. This does not necessarily become evident
immediately because no  law  says  that  you  should be  egoistic,  greedy,
avaricious, ruthless and irresponsible. But what the law does say is that we
should pursue financial profit in business and compete with one another.
This is reflected in numerous laws, regulations and treaties of nation-states,
the European Union (EU) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The
result is  an  epidemic emergence of  antisocial behaviour in  business –
because these kinds of behaviours lead to entrepreneurial “success”.
## TURNING EGOISM INTO COMMON GOOD
The “imperative” that we should compete in business and pursue the largest
possible amount of personal financial gain (i.e. behave egoistically) stems
from the paradoxical hope that the good of all will result from the egoistic
behaviour of the individual. This ideology was established 250 years ago by
Adam Smith, the first major national economist. Smith literally said: “It is
not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we
expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.”
## 2
My  aim  is  not  to  berate Smith. At  the  time  it  was  an  understandable
notion. The pursuit of self-interest on the part of “individuals” was new;
“enterprises” were  primarily tiny  and  powerless and,  in  addition,  locally
integrated and  personally responsible. In  many cases company founder,
proprietor,  employer and  employee were still  united in  one  person (the
baker, the carpenter, etc.). There was no free movement of capital, there
were no anonymous global corporations, no multi-billion-dollar investment
funds.

Smith hoped that  an  “invisible hand” would guide the  egoism of
individuals for  the  maximum  welfare of  all.  From a  metaphysical
perspective – Smith was a moral philosopher – he might well have meant
the hand of God. This is what Smith experts assume.
## 3
Today, we know that
the invisible hand does not exist. It is a pure hope, and neither economics
nor  economic policy operates on  the  basis of  hopes. Markets do  not
automatically transform their participants’ pursuit of self-interest into the
common good. The constitutional mandate that “the use of property is also
to serve the common good” falls short if there is no legal instrument like a
common good balance sheet that documents how companies obey it. In fact,
the probability that they violate the mandate is higher than that they comply,
because in the global competition the decisive factor of survival is not to be
“good” but to be “profitable”. As long as financial gain remains the “bottom
line” of business, Smith‘s dream is only a soap bubble. What happens in the
real  world  if  the  utmost goal  of  human beings is  to  pursue their own
advantage and to act against others is that they learn to take advantage of
others and deem this to be right and normal. But if we take advantage of
others we do not treat them as equals; we violate their dignity.
## DIGNITY IS THE HIGHEST GOOD
When I  ask  students attending my  lectures at  the  Vienna University of
Economics and  Business what  they  understand human dignity to  be,  I
frequently encounter a  general, awkward silence. The  students  do  not
appear to  have heard or  learned  anything about it  in  the  course of  their
studies. This is all the more alarming considering the fact that dignity is the
highest value: it is the first-named value in countless constitutions and it
forms the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Dignity signifies value: the same, unconditional, unalienable value of all
human beings. Dignity requires no “achievement” other than existence. It is
from the equal value of all human beings that our equality derives – in the
sense that all human beings living in a democracy should have the same
liberties, rights and opportunities. And only if everyone really does have the
same liberties is the condition fulfilled for enabling everyone to be really
free.  Immanuel Kant wrote that  human  dignity can  only  be  preserved  in
daily life and interactions if we deem and treat each other as being of equal

value: “So act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the
person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a
means.”  [emphasis Kant’s]
## 4
We  may indeed derive advantages from
dignified encounters as a by-product; according to Kant and common sense
this happens automatically if everyone wants the best for all, builds up a
foundation of trust, takes others seriously, listens to and esteems all others.
But gaining an advantage should not be the objective of the encounter. By
contrast, on the free market it is legal and customary to instrumentalize our
fellow human beings, violating  their dignity because our  goal  is  not  to
protect it. Our goal is to gain personal advantage, and in many cases this
can be achieved more easily if we take advantage of others and violate their
dignity. What is decisive is my attitude and my priority: am I interested in
the  greatest good and  the  preservation of  the  dignity of  all,  which is
something which affects me automatically and which I benefit from as well,
or am I primarily interested in my own welfare and my own advantage,
which others might, but will not necessarily draw benefit from?
If  we  pursue our  own  advantage as  our  supreme goal, the  customary
practice is to use others as means to achieve this goal and to take advantage
of them accordingly. For this reason, Smith’s perversion of goal and by-
product leads to widespread violations of human dignity and the systematic
restriction of the liberty of many.
## A FREE MARKET?
The so-called free market would only be free if all its active participants
could withdraw from any barter transaction without harm. But this is the
case for only some of the transactions made on the market. In many cases,
one  party might find  it  harder to  refrain from engaging in  a  particular
transaction than  the  other because he  or  she  depends on  it  to  a  higher
degree.
## 5
Many people cannot decide whether to buy food on a certain day
or not, whether to rent an apartment or not; many enterprises cannot decide
whether to take out a loan on a certain day or not – if they do not, they
might be bankrupt the next day; many farmers cannot decide freely if they
want to deliver their goods or not – they often have only one or a handful of
buyers to “choose” from, all of whom treat them equally poorly. For typical
barter transactions the following applies:

•An average employer has an easier time terminating a work contract and
is thus more able to determine the conditions of the work contract than
the average employee is.
•An average creditor has an easier time terminating a credit agreement
and is thus more able to determine the conditions of the agreement than
the average borrower is.
•An average landlord has an easier time deciding not to sign a rent
contract and is thus more able to determine the conditions of the rent
contract than the average lessee is.
•An average global corporation has an easier time dispensing with one of
its thousands of suppliers and is thus more able to determine the
conditions of supply contracts than the average supplier is.
An  imbalance in  private barter relations would not  matter so  much if
everyone were to  treat each other with respect and  the  intention of
preserving the other’s dignity. Then the more powerful person would meet
the less powerful at eye level, perceive them, take their needs and feelings
as seriously as their own, and not be happy with the result until both found
it acceptable. In market capitalism, however, the more powerful individual
is outright encouraged to utilize their edge, and the imbalance of power, in
the pursuit of their own advantage. The competition which results from this
is what creates the particular “efficiency” of the free market.
If a human community does not systematically preserve the dignity of
the individual then liberty will not be granted either, for the preservation of
dignity – human beings treating each other as equals – is the precondition
for liberty in every community. If all have an eye on their own advantage
they do not treat others as equals any more but rather as “instruments”, thus
endangering the liberty of all. For this reason a market economy which is
based on  profit maximization and  competition cannot be  called a  “free”
economy; this would constitute an intrinsic contradiction.
## TRUST IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EFFICIENCY
If we must constantly fear that our fellow human beings will take advantage
of us in the market as soon as they are in a position to do so, something else
will be systematically destroyed: trust. Some economists say this doesn’t

matter because the economy focuses completely on efficiency. But such a
view must be disputed, for trust is the highest social and cultural good we
know.  Trust  is  what holds societies together from the  inside –  not
efficiency! Imagine a  society  in  which you  can  trust every person
completely – would that not be the society with the highest quality of life?
And imagine the opposite, a society in which you had to mistrust everyone
– would that not be the society with the lowest quality of life?
The  interim conclusion to  be  drawn is  radical: so  long as  a  market
economy is  based on  pursuit of  profit and  competition and  the  mutual
exploitation that  results from it,  it  is  reconcilable with neither human
dignity nor liberty. It systematically destroys societal trust in the hope that
the  efficiency it  yields will  surpass that  achieved by  any  other form of
economy.  When such matters are  pointed out  to  mainstream economists
three familiar responses are commonly elicited:
1.There is no alternative to the market economy; this is common
knowledge and thus all further discussion is unnecessary.
2.Whoever does not acknowledge this wants to catapult society back into
poverty and the nineteenth century or drive it straight to communism,
and we all know how that ended.
3.The market economy is the most productive form of economy there is;
history has proved this. Competition spurs human beings to the highest
levels of performance – this is in addition to the fact that it is rooted in
human nature and is thus unavoidable.
We need to take a closer look at this last fundamental myth of the market
economy: “Competition is  in  most cases the  most efficient method we
know,”  writes Nobel Prize laureate for  economics Friedrich August von
## Hayek.
## 6
If a “Nobel Prize laureate” says this, it must be true – although
there is no Nobel Prize for economics.
## 7
I have tried to find the empirical
studies which led Hayek to this insight but I have found none. I explored
other economists as well, for in the scientific community it is customary for
colleagues to cite each other. And yet I found nothing here either. None of
the economists who have won a Nobel Prize have ever proved through a
study that  “competition is  the  most efficient method we  know”. This
cornerstone of economics is a mere claim which is believed by the large

majority of  economists. And  capitalism and  free  enterprise, the  world’s
dominant economic model for the past 250 years, is based on this belief.
Regarding the  crucial question,  does competition create stronger
motivation than any  other method? a  plethora of  studies have been
conducted in numerous disciplines (educational science, social psychology,
game theory, neurobiology) 369 of which studies were evaluated in a meta-
study. And of those with a clear result an amazing majority of 87 percent
found that  competition is not  the  most efficient method we  know;
## 8
cooperation is. The reason for this lies in the fact that cooperation motivates
people differently. Competition motivates people too; no one contests this,
and  market  capitalism has  proved this, but  it  motivates them less.
Cooperation motivates people through successful relationships, recognition,
esteem, mutual goals and mutual achievements. This latter is the definition
of  cooperation. In  contrast, the  definition of  competition is  “mutually
exclusive achievement of objectives”. I can only be successful if someone
else  is  unsuccessful. Competition  primarily “motivates” people  through
fear.  For  this  reason, fear  is  also  a  widespread phenomenon in  market
capitalism; many fear losing their job, their income, their status, their social
recognition and place in the community. When people compete for scarce
goods there are  many losers, and  most of  them fear  being affected
themselves. And there is another component of motivation when it comes to
competition. Aside from fear, competition elicits a form of delight – the
delight in triumphing, in being better than someone else. And this is, when
viewed from a psychological perspective, a very problematic motive, for
the goal of our actions should not be to be better than the others but rather
to perform our task well because we find purpose in it and do it gladly. This
is what we should derive self-value from. Whoever derives self-value from
being better than others is  dependent upon others being  worse.
Psychologically speaking, this constitutes pathological narcissism: feeling
better because others are worse is sick. The healthy thing to do would be to
nourish our  sense of  self-worth by  means of  activities which  we  enjoy
performing because we have chosen to do them of our own free will and see
purpose in them. If we concentrated on being ourselves instead of being
better, no one would be jeopardized and there would be no need for losers.
It is a matter of objectives. If I am better at performing a certain task
than someone else but this is a by-product rather than my objective, then
there is no problem. I will pay no attention to my being better and will not

evaluate it  as  a  “triumph” –  and  will  help  the  other person. A  problem
ensues if my objective is to be better than someone else, if I am striving for
a “win–lose situation” – which is the definition of competition used here. If
my goal is to do my task well and I do not care how others do theirs, then I
do not need any competition – but that is the very essence of the myth,
namely that without competition human beings would have no incentive to
perform, would not be motivated to do their tasks well. But according to
psychological insights it is the other way around: motivation is stronger if it
comes from within (one speaks of “intrinsic motivation”) than if it comes
from external sources (“extrinsic motivation”), for  example from
competition. The  best performance is  achieved not  when there are
competitors but  rather when human beings are  energized by  devoting
themselves to something and are utterly fulfilled by it. They do not need
any competition for that.
If honest economists actually wanted to build the market economy on the
basis of “the most efficient method” there is and they took notice of the
current state of scientific research, they would have to base it on structural
cooperation and intrinsic motivation. The fact that mainstream economists
do not do this is an indication that science and insight play no role here but
rather what dominates is  the  desire to  underpin existing hegemonic
structures ideologically.  Those  with power are  served very  well by
competition: if we, as human beings, do not learn to cooperate and act in
the spirit of solidarity we will not call power relations into question but
rather will attempt, instead, to elbow our way into the realm of power and
the social elite. In doing so, the majority will fall by the wayside. And the
social climate will be poisoned to ever-increasing degrees because we will
constantly take advantage of others, exploit and debase them in the pursuit
of our own advantage, weakening and destroying trust and social bonds.
## THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURSUIT OF PROFIT
## AND COMPETITION: THE TEN CRISES OF CAPITALISM
Contrary to  the  prognoses and  promises held  out  by  the  theory of  free
enterprise, the  pursuit of  “self-interest” (Smith) as  the  supreme goal  of
competition leads to the following:

1.The concentration and misuse of power. The system-immanent
pressure for growth – the pressure to become ever larger and more
powerful and to ultimately obtain the status of a “global player” – leads
to the emergence of gigantic corporations which misuse market power,
close off markets, block innovation, and devour competitors or push
them out of the market. In using such phrases as “brimming war
chests”, “hostile takeovers” or “kill your competitors”,
## 9
the market
idiom reveals what is ultimately at stake when it comes to the pursuit of
one’s own advantage.
2.Suppression of competition and the building of cartels. Once only a
few players are left, adversarial conflict can suddenly turn into tactical,
but not intrinsic cooperation. For the objective remains the same:
maximum profit. If power allows the formation of cartels and
oligopolies then preference will be given to this strategy because it is
more effective than competition. Competition produces losers;
cooperation produces only winners. This is why branch enterprises
cooperate as soon as they can (this being inadvertent and unappealing
proof of the superiority of cooperation – unappealing because in this
case cooperation is not a goal but rather a means of achieving a wrong
purpose, namely to take advantage of others). The recent bank bailouts
show that the present economic model is not a matter of competition
and free enterprise at all but rather of (governments) securing profits
and power: this is the reason why the business and political elite
cooperate and eliminate the competition – competition evidently not
being the objective after all.
3.Competition between locations. States systematically try to attract
enterprises and improve conditions for the pursuit of profit; the
consequences are wage dumping, social dumping, fiscal dumping and
environmental dumping, preferential treatment of global corporations
over small local companies, and enticing special offers such as banking
secrecy and removal of banking supervision because these are viewed
as “locational advantages”. If the egoism of enterprises infects states,
nationalism will flourish in the midst of alleged “globalization”.
4.Inefficient pricing. Prices are often not the rational result of the
activities of rational market participants but rather the expression of
power relations. The power created by supply and demand is often very
unequally distributed, which is why prices often reflect the interests of

the powerful rather than actual costs or values. The care of children,
sick persons, the elderly and gardens often is not rewarded financially at
all, for example, whereas the maintenance of hedge funds is often
astronomically expensive even though they have a negative impact on
society.
5.Social polarization and fear. The current capitalistic market economy
is a power economy. The larger – the more global – “free competition”
is, the greater will be the imbalance of power between the protagonists,
and with it the inequalities and the gap between the rich and the poor. In
the USA the best-paid manager now earns 350,000 times the legal
minimum wage.
## 10
This has nothing to do with “rational pricing” or with
efficiency or justice: it is exclusively a matter of power. As a result,
trust in society is declining and fear is rising. In the USA, trust among
people has declined from 60 percent in 1960 to less than 40 percent in
## 2004.
## 11
The German Anxiety Index has risen from 24 percent in 1991
to 45 percent in the past few years.
## 12
6.Failure to satisfy basic needs and reduce hunger. The explosion in
the numbers of the famine-stricken shows how little globalized market
capitalism is capable of satisfying even basic needs and thus protecting
human rights. In the early 1990s hunger affected fewer than 800 million
people, but in 2009, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) reported that 1.023 billion were affected;
between 2011 and 2013 the figure dropped to 843 million.
## 13
Satisfaction of basic needs is not the goal of capitalism; maximizing
profit is. In many cases this leads to a situation in which basic needs
that have no purchasing power are not met (with nutrition coming first,
followed by medical care, housing and education), whereas purchasing
power for which no need exists requires the “invention” of new needs
(for example addictive foods, cosmetic surgery, SUVs). Capitalism
systematically misdirects creativity and investments.
7.Ecological destruction. Since the supreme goal of capitalism is to
increase financial capital (and not the common good), other goals such
as environmental protection slide down the list of priorities. In its
Millennium Synthesis Report the UNO ascertained that the health
condition of almost all planetary ecosystems (oceans, fields, rivers,
mountains, forests) deteriorated between 1950 and 2000. They are

approaching their breaking point and sooner or later they will collapse.
Then the “performance” of those ecosystems which are necessary to
sustain human life will be in danger, impacting on climate stability, the
regulation of humidity and temperature, the control of diseases and
vermin, soil fertility and absorptive capacity. Capitalism is destructive
because it strives blindly to increase financial capital rather than the
natural foundations of human life and the economy.
8.Loss of meaning. Since the objective of capitalism is to accumulate
material values, it quickly overshoots the side effect of satisfying basic
material needs, subjugating all other values – quality of relationships
and environment, time prosperity, creativity, autonomy – in the process.
In the EU, working hours increased again by 8 percent between 1995
and 2005.
## 14
According to a poll conducted by Gallup, in the USA 70
percent of American employees are unengaged with their workplaces or
even actively disengaged.
## 15
More and more people become increasingly
alienated from their true desires and ideals and instead become addicted
to consumption. With 24 million individuals affected, the compulsion to
shop has become a pandemic in the USA.
## 16
In Austria, almost half of
young people aged between 14 and 24 years are “significantly at risk of
becoming shopping-addicted”, with 10 percent “strongly
endangered”.
## 17
This is a kind of success in capitalist terms: the US
economy invests more than $11 billion in its publicity attack on
children.
## 18
9.Erosion of values. In today’s business world the most antisocial people
make it to the top because what counts is optimization of monetary
targets: people who are “more able” to filter out all other human, social
and ecological goals are culturally “selected”. Today egoists are
particularly able to be “successful”. If the business world systematically
rewards egoism and competitive behaviour and people are viewed as
successful if they work their way up in this dynamic of incentives, these
values will rub off on all realms of society, starting with politics and the
media and ultimately affecting our interpersonal relationships as well.
As the German social psychologist Erich Fromm put it, “The capitalistic
character shapes the societal character”.
## 19
10.Shutdown of democracy. When pursuit of profit and self-interest are
the highest goals, business protagonists do their utmost to reach these

goals. Not only interpersonal relationships, personal talents and natural
resources are used as means to this end: needless to say, democracy is
used as well. Since the times of Adam Smith the ethics of “self-interest”
have placed this above the common good, the hope being that benefit to
the common good will result as a by-product. The reality looks very
different, however. Global enterprises, banks and investment funds
become so powerful that they succeed in using lobbying, media
ownership, political party financing and public–private partnerships to
make parliaments and governments serve their particular interests rather
than those of the common good. Thus democracy becomes the last and
most prominent victim of “free markets”.
I  have published an  extensive analysis of  this  elsewhere;
## 20
thus  I  will
conclude these considerations here and begin to outline the alternative.

All economic activity serves the common good.
Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria, Art. 151
## THE GOAL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
When I  ask  students at  business schools and  in  university economics
departments what the goal of economic activity is I almost always get the
same answer: “Money!”, “Monetary gain!”, “Profit!” Then I  ask,  “Who
says that?” “That’s what we learn here,” I am told. “And what sources do
your teachers cite in telling you this?” Silence. “What is the justification for
viewing gain or  increase of  profit as  the  goal of  economic activity?”
## Silence.
I  sought evidence of  such notions in  the  constitutions of  democratic
states. To start with I looked for it in the constitution of Bavaria, Germany,
where I read: “The entirety of economic activity shall serve the common
wellbeing”.
## 1
At first I thought this must be an error. But other constitutions
claim the same thing: “Property entails responsibility” is what we read in
Germany’s Basic Law; “its use is also to serve the welfare of the general
public”.
## 2
According to  Italy’s  constitution “public and  private economic
activity should be oriented to the common good”.
## 3
Colombia’s constitution
states: “Economic activity and private initiative are free within the limits of
the common good.”
## 4
The Constitution of Ireland says:

We, the people of Eire (...) seeking (...) the common good (...) give
to ourselves this Constitution // All powers of government (...) derive
(...) from the people, whose right it is (...) to decide all questions of
national policy, according to the requirements of the common good. //
The State, accordingly, may (...) delimit by law the exercise of the
said rights  with a  view to  reconciling their exercise with  the
exigencies of  the  common good. //  The  State shall (...)  direct its
policy towards securing that the ownership and control of the material
resources of the community may be so distributed amongst private
individuals and  the  various classes as  best  to  serve the  common
good.
## 5
And the US constitution features in its preamble the words “promote the
general welfare”. The constitutions of democratic states are pervaded by a
wide consensus  as  to  what the  goal of  economic activity is:  the
advancement of the common good. In any case no constitution that I have
read states that the goal of economic activity is to achieve monetary gain.
Looking all the way back to ancient Greece, Aristotle called the focus on
monetary gain “unnatural”, distinguishing the  “oikonomia” from the
## “chrematistike”.
## 6
In the Western world there has been consensus for over
two thousand years concerning the goal of economic activity. As you can
see, the Economy for the Common Good is not suggesting anything new; it
merely proposes  that  the  constitutional goal  of  the  economy should be
implemented in the existing economic order as well.
## PUTTING THE SYSTEM ON A NEW COURSE
To  do  this  our  current market economy would have to  be  put  on  a  new
course: directing our path away from pursuit of profit and competition, and
instead striving towards pursuit of the common good and cooperation. The
framework of  legal incentives would have to  abandon “maximization of
self-interest” and embrace “the common good” as its guiding light instead,
with the  goal of  all  enterprise being to  make the  largest possible
contribution to  the  common good. This is  nothing new.  The  goals of
individual economic protagonists would merely be  harmonized with

constitutional goals. This would be  the  first  step  towards an  ethical
reorientation of free markets.
## REDEFINING ECONOMIC SUCCESS
Step number two: if the common good is the democratically defined goal
then it would only be logical to measure economic success on the basis of
whether or  to  what  extent this  goal  is  reached. And  such  success  would
have to be measured at all levels: at the level of national economies (the
macro level), the level of individual enterprises (the meso level) and the
level of every single investment (the micro level).
Today we  measure economic success on  the  macro level in  terms of
gross domestic product, on the entrepreneurial level in terms of financial
profit, and  at  the  level of  individual investment in  terms of  “return on
investment” or  “return on  equity”. What all  three standard success
indicators have in  common is  that  they  are  “monetary” indicators. But
money is not the goal of economic activity; it merely constitutes its means.
Now comes the crucial question: is it more meaningful to measure the
success of projects in terms of the means they employ and the accumulation
thereof or in terms of the goals they have and the extent to which these
goals are reached? Perhaps this confusion of goals and means is central to
the problems of our current economic order. In our current system, methods
of measuring success confuse goals and means. In capitalism, maximizing
profit is the highest goal; promoting the common good may be used as a
means of achieving this end but certainly not in all cases. In the Economy
for the Common Good, improving the common good would be the highest
goal, and capital would be a valuable means of attaining this. In some cases
the accumulation of wealth could indeed be used to reach this goal, but in
other cases it may not be necessary at all. Neither the use of money nor the
increase thereof would be  compulsory –  the  success of  enterprises,
investments and  national economies would not  be  measured in  terms of
profit but rather in terms of the goal of promoting the common good.
The  weakness of  monetary indicators as  parameters for  measuring
economic success is due to the fact that though money can best express the
exchange value of a commodity – the value for which something is bought
or sold – it has no use value by itself and is also incapable of expressing the

use value of commodities and services. Yet the use value or usefulness of a
commodity is  of primary interest  to  human beings. It  is  the  goal of
economic activity. Exchange values can neither provide me with warmth
nor nourish me. For that I need food, clothing, housing, relationships, intact
ecosystems –  in  other words, use  values. The  GDP and  financial gain
provide no reliable information about the availability of use values. Does an
increase in the GDP give any reliable indication, for example, of whether a
given country:
•is free of hunger or homeless?
•is at war or in a state of peace?
•is a democracy or a dictatorship?
•is experiencing a decline or growth in the consumption of resources?
•has a just distribution?
•has equal rights for women or discriminates against them?
•has a society in which trust or fear is growing?
No  matter which use  value we  consider,  a  rising GDP is  not  capable of
measuring what really counts!
According to textbooks of economics the goal of economic activity is to
satisfy human needs. They are the “ultimate end” of the entire enormous
undertaking called  “business”. And  if  the  most important needs of  all
human beings are satisfied then the famous vision of “prosperity for all”
(Ludwig Erhard, former German Chancellor), the  “general welfare” or
simply the  common  good is  achieved. So  far,  the  slogan has  been “The
business of business is business”. Our answer is: “The purpose of business
is the common good.”
## MEASURE THE GOAL, NOT THE MEANS
The drawbacks of using GDP as an index of welfare have long ago been
recognized, which is why the search for alternative indicators of prosperity
began as  early as  the  1970s with Herman Daly’s  Index of  Sustainable
## Human Welfare.
## 7
The  London-based New Economics Foundation think
tank created a Happy Planet Index.
## 8
The OECD developed the Better Life

## Index,
## 9
the Enquete Commission of the German Parliament on “Growth,
Prosperity and Quality of life” defined the “W3” indicators,
## 10
and France’s
President Sarkozy created the Stiglitz–Sen–Fitoussi Commission to search
for  alternatives to  the  GDP.
## 11
The  country which has  made the  most
progress in  this  direction is  the  tiny  nation of  Bhutan with its  “Gross
National Happiness”. No complex mathematical model was developed here;
instead six thousand households are surveyed every two years, answering
questions such as the following:
•How is your health?
•How well are you doing in comparison to the previous year?
•Will your children have a better life one day?
•Do you trust your neighbours?
•Do you get time every day to take a break/meditate/pray?
Many economists still claim that “happiness cannot be measured”. And yet
by assessing 33 indicators regarding all aspects of quality of life, as done in
Bhutan, you can come much closer to what constitutes “happiness” than by
using GDP as  an  index. In  my  opinion some twenty indicators  would
suffice  to  create the  Common Good Product of  any  national economy.
Developing such a thing could constitute a central project for the Common
Good movement.
The Common Good Communities described below could be a start. In
decentralized assemblies citizens could be  asked to  name the  twenty
indicators of  life  quality most relevant to  them and  from them derive a
communal Life  Quality or  Common Good Index. Later,  hundreds or
thousands of  such local indices for  the  Common Good Product at  the
domestic, the EU or even the international level could be synthesized.
We want to repeat this exercise on the level of business management.
Does the amount of profit a company makes give us any reliable indication
of whether:
•the company is creating jobs or downsizing;
•the working conditions are becoming more humane or more stressful;
•the company is mindful of the environment or exploits it;

•its income is distributed fairly;
•the company manufactures weapons or produces local organic foods?
The  answer is  clearly no.  Financial profit gives us  just  as  little  reliable
information about the development of even one use value, the satisfaction
of even one basic need or the fulfilment of even one constitutional value. A
rising GDP systematically fails to measure the goal of economic activity at
all!
In  the  Economy for  the  Common Good the  success of  a  national
economy would be measured in terms of the Common Good Product; in a
methodically sound manner and  conforming to  a  large  number of
constitutions (the UK  is  a  rare exception of  a  country without a
constitution) the success of an enterprise would be measured in terms of its
Common Good  Balance Sheet. Today an  enterprise can  be  “successful”
while jobs are being cut, the environment is being destroyed, democracy is
being undermined and  meaningless products are  being manufactured: in
other words, a  company can  be  viewed as  successful even  if  it  is
contributing to the aggravation of every social and ecological problem. The
automatic mechanism which Adam Smith believed in,  namely  that  all
would be cared for if everyone cared for him- or herself, does not exist.
There can be a connection between profit and the common good but there is
not necessarily any connection. The Common Good Balance Sheet would
create a reliable connection: Adam Smith’s hope of an invisible hand would
be fulfilled by the creation of a visible hand, a method which measures and
rewards the  success of  economic activity in  terms of  its  contribution to
society.
## MEASURING THE COMMON GOOD
If  the  common good is  the  goal  of  all  economic activity then  it  is  only
logical that  this  must be  measured by  a  corresponding Common Good
Balance Sheet, which would then become the main business balance sheet.
What has  hitherto  served as  the  main type  of  balance sheet, namely the
financial balance sheet, would become an auxiliary balance sheet. It would
continue to represent how the enterprise covers its costs, investments and
provisions and  how  it  develops its  financial resources, but  it  would not

represent primary entrepreneurial “success”. As in the past, enterprises that
were striving to  promote the  common good would not  want  to  make
financial losses. Without profits, enterprises active in the market economy
quickly fail.  Profits should not  be  made for  the  sake  of  making  profits,
however. They are merely a means of fulfilling a purpose. What is currently
experienced as  “excessiveness”, “exorbitance” and  “greed” in  capitalism
would be eliminated if the use of profit was controlled by society to some
degree. There will be more discussion on financial balance sheets later.
The  Common Good Balance Sheet measures how  key  constitutional
values which serve the common good are fulfilled by companies. As I have
noted above, the five values “measured” by this balance sheet are nothing
new. They are the most prevalent constitutional values of democratic states:
human dignity, solidarity, justice, ecological sustainability and democracy.
## 16
The Common Good Balance Sheet measures how these basic values are
lived in regard to the stakeholders of an enterprise. Stakeholders constitute
all groups of persons who are affected by the activities of an enterprise or
who  have a  direct  relationship to  them: suppliers, investors, employees,
customers, “competitors”, local  communities, future generations, and  the
environment. To make the Common Good Balance Sheet more transparent
we have drawn up a Common Good Matrix in which the five basic values
are entered on the horizontal x-axis and the stakeholders are entered on the
vertical y-axis. At  the  intersections we  currently measure seventeen
Common Good indicators, for example:
•whether products/services satisfy human needs;
•how humane working conditions are;
•how environmentally friendly production processes are;
•how ethical sales activities are;
•how cooperative the enterprise’s conduct is vis-à-vis other enterprises;
•how profits are distributed;
•whether or not women get equal treatment and equal pay;
•how democratic decision-making processes are.
What authority  could “define” just  what the  common good means,
however? There are  answers to  both questions. A  plenitude of  clearly
defined and  measurable indicators has  already been elaborated by  other

corporate social responsibility standards and instruments ranging from the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the SA8000 Social Standard to the
OECD Corporate Governance Guidelines and  the  ISO environmental
management systems.
## 12
All  arrive at  the  same goals and  values: How
socially responsible is  an  enterprise’s  conduct? How ecologically
sustainable are  its  production and  distribution processes? How just  is  its
distribution of profits? What is the quality of its workplaces? How is co-
determination experienced? Does it  support political responsibility
(corporate citizenship)? The more clearly a democratic society focuses on
defining such indicators, the  more  accurate and  differentiated  the  results
will  be  –  just  like  physical measuring instruments become increasingly
sophisticated once a sufficient number of people have honed and refined
them.
The  Matrix Development Team  has  developed seventeen indicators
which are clearly measurable by assigning points. For each indicator, four
levels can be reached: first steps, advanced, experienced and exemplary. In
a handbook developed over the course of many years,
## 13
several pages are
devoted to the description of each indicator, with information including the
concept, the definition, the mode of measurement, examples and sources.
The handbook is a work-in-progress document which – like all Economy
for  the  Common Good documents  –  continues to  be developed by  a
growing group of  people in  an  open-source manner in  the  spirit of  the
creative commons.
## DEFINING THE COMMON GOOD
And who “defines” the  common good? Within the  Common Good
movement it is believed that this can only be done through a democratic
process of discussion and decision making since the concrete meaning of
the concept does not exist a priori and can change in the course of time.
Historically speaking the  concept dates back to  Aristotle and  his  teacher
Plato. It started to be applied precisely by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth
century: “Bonum commune est melius quam bonum unius [The common
good is better than the good of the one]”
## 14
Since then the concept of the
common good has pervaded Christian social ethics as a “pole star”.
## 15
## But
no  matter  how  sublime the  tradition might be,  it  could theoretically be

postulated by a dictator or a totalitarian regime which claims to know best
what is  good for  all.  In  fact  both rightist and  leftist dictatorships have
employed the concept of the common good, but this is the unavoidable fate
of  all  charismatic notions. “Freedom”, “love” and  “God” have certainly
been hijacked and misused just as often – but this should not stop us from
using these concepts; we simply have to define them democratically.
The model for  the  Economy  for  the  Common Good requires a
“definition” of the common good that is applicable to the instruments that
measure success at three levels: investment, the enterprise and the national
economy; the  other economic-political measures do  not  require such a
definition. The  basic work needed to  conceptualize the  common good
product can be done in common good communities. The Common Good
Creditworthiness Assessment is currently being developed by the Bank for
the  Common Good in  cooperation with other ethical banks. And the
Common Good Balance Sheet is  the core  of  the  internationally growing
Economy for the Common Good movement, which started in 2009 with a
small circle of  about fifteen businesspeople involved in  the  activist
organization called Attac. The first version of the balance sheet, published
in August 2010, was developed before the movement was founded. When
the kick-off party for the Economy for the Common Good movement was
given on 6 October 2010, this version was presented to the hundred or so
attendees. In 2011, two dozen companies spontaneously agreed to do the
balance sheet on a voluntary basis. With the help of an editorial staff of
four,  the  preliminary concept  was  improved. At  the  request of  the
pioneering enterprises involved, the number of indicators was reduced from
about fifty  to  seventeen with  the  aim  of  increasing its  user-friendliness.
Version 3.0  was  the  ultimately  valid Common Good Balance Sheet for
2011; some 60 enterprises drew one up.
Common Good Balance Sheet versions 4.0 and 4.1 followed in 2012 and
- The editorial staff has grown with the movement, with one editor now
in charge of each indicator. Each editor coordinates a team of experts and
interested individuals and incorporates all feedback on the assigned criteria.
So  far,  hundreds of  individuals, enterprises and institutions have
participated. In  the  years to  come we  anticipate that  thousands and
ultimately tens of  thousands of  enterprises, private individuals and
organizations will  contribute their experiences and  expertise via  the

internet, at public events, and as pioneers. In this way the balance sheet will
continue to be fine-tuned in the years to come.
This will not give it democratic legitimization, however. Once we deem
it to be sound, that is, representative, precise and user-friendly, we could
call for the election of an economic convention whose task would be to
formulate a law, taking other preparatory work into consideration as well.
Such a law would need to be agreed upon by the democratic sovereign (see
page 141) and anchored in the constitution in the accepted form. A law or
section of the constitution has rarely been drawn up so neatly. The Common
Good Balance Sheet could be revised and newly adapted at any time. But
such steps would always take over to avoid stack initiated and resolved by
the sovereign people.
## Common Good Matrix 4.1
This is a simplified depiction. You can find the current version of the Common Good Matrix and the
Common Good Balance Sheet at www.ecogood.org/

Let us return to the basic idea for a moment: a democratic society must
be in a position to formulate the ten to thirty central expectations they have
of  enterprises, to  demand accountability regarding them and  to  promote
fulfilment thereof through the proposed incentive instrument. If it does not
do this, the only alternative is to make sanctions and issue decrees, which is
a more rigid form of regulation. The currently used mode of regulation is
often not  recognized as  such. And yet  “profit orientation”, obligatory
“financial reporting”, “competition” (including cannibalism and
“bankruptcies”), which result from all  of  this  constitute an  extremely
effective regulatory order that  incentivizes or  even compels certain
behaviours. The unfortunate results are widespread courses of action and
strategies which harm society, destroy trust and damage relationships, but
these are  much too  rarely ascribed to  this  misguiding legal framework,
being all too often explained by flawed human nature instead. The Common
Good Balance Sheet constitutes  an  attempt to  correct this  defective
programming of the market and the “laws of the market”, and to harmonize
these laws with the values of relationships and (of) democratic societies.
## DEMANDS MADE ON A UNIVERSAL BALANCE SHEET
The  Common Good Balance Sheet would integrate itself into  a  growing
spectrum of  product labels (organic foods, Fair  Trade), environmental
management systems (EMAS, ISO), quality management systems (EFQM,
Balanced Score Card), codes of  conduct (OECD guidelines) and
sustainability reports (GRI). The  first generation of  corporate social
responsibility instruments proved to be generally ineffective, however. All
standards are  non-binding and  no  one  is  subject to  legal monitoring.
Unfortunately, the moment such standards start to conflict with the main
balance sheet – the financial one – they are suddenly of no use anymore
because this would attack the vital nerve, the famous “bottom line”, of the
enterprise and damage it in the framework of our current system dynamics.
Whoever curbs financial gain  for  the  benefit of  a  non-binding auxiliary
balance sheet catapults him- or  herself out  of  the  race. This  is  also  the
reason why corporate groups insist that all such auxiliary balance sheets be
non-binding in nature – because in this way they remain ineffective.

The Common Good Balance Sheet aspires to become the first corporate
social responsibility instrument of the second generation which actually has
an  impact.  The  prerequisite for  this  is  the  fulfilment of  eight essential
requirements:
1.Binding force. The fact that doing things on a voluntary basis does not
fulfil the goal has been proved by numerous corporate social
responsibility instruments.
2.A holistic approach. It would not suffice to measure merely ecological
aspects or the quality of workplaces: all basic values count!
3.Measurability. It should be possible to measure the results – that is, to
evaluate them objectively.
4.Comparability. All enterprises should be accountable to the same
goals/indicators; otherwise the more successful enterprises could not be
rewarded.
5.Comprehensibility. Not only business consultants and Common Good
auditors should understand the balance sheet but also customers,
employees and interested members of the public.
6.Publicity. The Common Good Balance Sheet should be linked to a QR
code and downloadable online.
7.External audit. This is to prevent enterprises from evaluating
themselves – as is the practice for some corporate social responsibility
instruments.
8.Legal consequences. Whoever contributes more to the community
should be rewarded for this effort, following the principle of justice of
performance.
The Common Good Balance Sheet meets all eight requirements, which is
why it could have the desired effect of ethically rerouting the economy in
the direction of sustainability, distributional justice and meaningful, health-
promoting labour.
The Economy for  the  Common  Good movement is  striving to
incorporate this  approach into  a  current EU  directive; in  2014 the  EU
Parliament issued a directive on “non-financial reporting”.
## 16
It states that all
enterprises with  more than 500 employees are  obliged to  publish
information which goes beyond key financial figures. In the first version of

the directive, enterprises are offered a selection of various instruments, one
of which they may, but don’t have to use. The Economy for the Common
Good movement is striving to see that these eight essential requirements are
incorporated into the EU directive regardless of whether the future form of
non-financial reporting is  called an  “ethics balance sheet” a  “societal
balance sheet” or a “common good balance sheet”.
## CREATE MARKET TRANSPARENCY
This  is  how  the  Common Good  Balance Sheet works: depending on  the
degree to which targets are fulfilled the auditors assign a certain number of
points for each balance sheet indicator. Every enterprise, whether it is run
by a single person, a public charity, a utilities company, a medium-sized
business or a market-listed joint-stock company, can reach a maximum of
1,000 Common Good points. To  begin with, the  results of  the  Common
Good Balance Sheet could appear in the form of a label on all products and
services, being colour-coded according to five categories, for example like
this:
•negative score, Level 1, red.
•0 to 250 points, Level 2, orange.
•251 to 500 points, Level 3, yellow.
•501 to 750 points, Level 4, light green.
•751 to 1,000 points, Level 5, green.
This would enable consumers to  get  quick, concise information  on  the
Common Good performance of  the  enterprise whose product they  were
thinking of  buying. The  Common Good colour could appear next  to  the
barcode or the QR code of a product. If the customer scanned the code with
his or her mobile phone, the entire Common Good Balance Sheet would
appear on the display. It would be obligatory to make this accessible to the
public. Consumers could immediately ascertain whether a  product was
“only” produced in an ecologically sustainable way and produced locally, or
whether the company which made it also gave women equal pay for equal
work and had a family-friendly working time model.

The “rationality” and “efficiency” of the market economy are justified in
textbooks on the premise that all market participants have all information
“completely” and “symmetrically” at their disposal. But this is not the case
today; if we pull any product at random off the supermarket shelf it will not
disclose who manufactured it, under what working conditions or with what
environmental effects. Nor will it tell us whether women were treated the
same as  men  in  the  process, whether the  enterprise cooperated  with  its
competitors or cannibalized them, whether it paid a fair amount of taxes or
hid its profits in a tax haven, hired lobbyists or financed political parties.
Measured in terms of its own theory, the market economy can be neither
rational nor  efficient because the  prerequisite for  this  –  transparent
information –  is  lacking. It  is  not  uncommon for  advertising to  give
misinformation regarding the  effect,  content and  origin of  products. The
Common Good Balance Sheet  would bring the  reality of  the  market
economy closer to its theoretical ideal, thus making it more efficient.
## REWARDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMMON
## GOOD
Now comes the decisive step: coupling the results of the Common Good
Balance Sheet with differentiated legal treatment. The more Common Good
points an  enterprise obtained, the  more legal privileges it  would enjoy,
almost in the conservative sense of “just desserts”, for whoever does more
for  the  community  should be  rewarded for  it  more by  society.  Suitable
incentive instruments already exist; they would only need to  be  used
systematically for  performance aimed towards the  Common Good, for
example:
•a lower tax rate
•a lower customs tariff
•bank loans with better conditions
•preferential status for public procurement and the award of contracts
(one fifth of the economic output!)
•research cooperation with public universities
•direct funding, etc.

Today, all enterprises are admitted to the market under the same conditions,
irrespective of the degree to which they fulfil the values of the constitution
or violate them and without any consideration of their ethical performance
or lack thereof. The effect of this “equal treatment” is that the more ruthless
and  irresponsible protagonists on  the  market are  more likely to  win  out
because they are able to offer goods and services more cheaply. Those who
act unethically are rewarded. This is the effect of the false “guiding light” of
the economy.
In the Economy for the Common Good only “the same” would be treated
equally; those who were “unequal” would be treated unequally, which is to
say, higher performance would be rewarded. These legal advantages would
help  those who  were oriented to  the  Common Good cover their higher
costs. The  consequence would  be  that  ethical, sustainable and  regional
products manufactured and  traded using fair  methods would be  less
expensive than unethical, unsustainable, throwaway articles manufactured
and  traded using unfair methods. In  this  way  ethical and  responsible
enterprises would  systematically  gain  a  stronger foothold on  the  market.
The “laws of the market” would be harmonized with the basic values of
society.
Should rewards turn out to be so generous as to enable an enterprise to
make considerable profits, it would only be allowed to use these for certain
purposes. There would be no use in maximizing profits for the benefit of
self-interest. Benefit would be gained, however, through “maximization” of
Common Good points: the  better the  Common Good Balance Sheet the
higher the probability that an enterprise would survive. In contrast to the
situation today, a company’s financial balance sheet would no longer be the
decisive factor when it came to surviving or not. An unethical company
would be incapable of achieving a positive financial result.
The  incentive effect  could be  reinforced: the  Common Good Balance
Sheet of an enterprise would improve to the degree that the Common Good
Balance Sheet of the suppliers, subcontractors, credit institutions and other
enterprises it  cooperated with scored well. Through the  interaction of
consumer decisions, legal advantages, preferential status for  “more
successful” suppliers and  subcontractors and  money  lenders, as  well  as
Common Good audits by  loan-granting banks, a  powerful spiral of
incentives with  a  bullwhip effect  in  the  direction of  the  Common Good
would ensue. Society would finally reach its goals in business.

## COMMON GOOD AUDITS
A  frequently asked question is:  Who should audit the  balance  sheet? If
companies were allowed to draw up a balance sheet themselves, then they
could also  evaluate  it  themselves. Would  it  not  be  necessary  to  create a
Leviathan state which monitors and oversees enterprises every inch of the
way?
The answer to this is no, there is – almost – no need for such a state. In
this case the market would in fact regulate itself! To illustrate this point, let
us start by looking at the procedure which is used for financial reporting
today: a  financial balance sheet is  drawn up  by  the  enterprise, audited
internally and  then sent  out  to  a  chartered accountant –  a  freelance
professional. If the balance sheet is “verified” the state then comes along
and demands taxes. The tax authority completes the process.
The  procedure envisioned for  the  Common Good Balance Sheet is
similar yet easier. The Common Good Balance Sheet would be drawn up by
the enterprise (ideally with the participation of all employees) and audited
internally (for example by a Common Good officer) and then externally, by
the  Common  Good auditor.  That is  it.  Once the  Common Good auditor
verified the  balance sheet, the  enterprise would automatically fall  into  a
certain tax and customs tariff category and a certain class of credit terms.
The state would do  nothing except where public procurement and
invitations to  tender were concerned. Here the  state would look at  the
Common Good Balance Sheet first, and then at the price.
In  addition to  legal accreditation and  quality assurance for  Common
Good auditors, the state would only perform one other monitoring function
– on a spot-check basis. In the event that an enterprise falsified its Common
Good Balance Sheet, bribed the auditor or this person certified the falsified
balance sheet, there would have to  be  a  supervisory procedure and
possibilities for sanctioning any corrupt auditors. But if there was the threat
of  a  hefty fine  for  the  first  violation and  withdrawal of  the  person’s
professional licence  in  the  event of  a  second violation, auditors would
consider carefully whether they should commit such a crime or not. For as
opposed to financial balance sheets, Common Good Balance Sheets offers
numerous advantages so  far  as  the  problem of  fraudulent falsification is
concerned:

•they are public and accessible to all;
•they are comprehensible to all because the criteria used are simple and
humane;
•numerous stakeholder groups have a concrete interest in the accuracy of
Common Good Balance Sheets; attempts at falsification would soon be
revealed. Another aspect under discussion is “peer evaluation”. All
persons connected with an enterprise would participate in the evaluation
in order to give auditors a broader basis of information for their work.
Enterprises would have an  “intrinsic” interest in  obtaining the  highest
possible number of Common Good points because of the prospect of certain
advantages; nevertheless the  implementation of  each individual  criterion
would be “voluntary”, which is why no state auditing official and no state
bureaucracy (Ministry of  the  Common Good) would be  required. The
Common Good Balance Sheet controls the conduct of enterprises without
setting off any additional regulatory orgy.
Analogous to the separation of consultation and inspection in the case of
financial balance sheets, these services should be separated for Common
Good audits as well. A legal body would probably be required for certifying
Common Good auditors so as to ensure the quality of their work. It might
be the same as for financial auditors.
In light of the complexity of the subject, it is also conceivable that audit
teams would be  needed instead  of  individual auditors. This would also
serve to  improve inspection results and  more effectively safeguard the
process against bribes.
## PROFIT AS MEANS
So much for the Common Good Balance Sheet. But what would happen to
the financial balance sheet? First of all: it would continue to be drawn up by
all companies, especially since the Economy for the Common Good would
constitute a form of market economy (but a cooperative and ethical rather
than  a  capitalistic  one)  in  which  private enterprises, money and  market-
generated product prices would exist – albeit under different conditions and
prerequisites than today’s. But since financial gain would no longer be the
goal, the financial balance sheet would become an auxiliary, or rather, a

means balance sheet –  entirely analogous to  money,  but  which should
actually only constitute a means of exchange and not the purpose thereof.
The purpose of exchange is to satisfy needs. Financial balance sheets fulfil
a key condition for this but they are not the actual object of entrepreneurial
activity.  The  purpose of  entrepreneurial pursuit, its  societal  task, is
represented by the Common Good Balance Sheet. The purpose of financial
gain would be inverted; it would become the means rather than the goal.
Just  what  does  this  mean? We  have worked hard  to  hone this  crucial
aspect of the Economy for the Common Good. Since profits can either be
beneficial or  detrimental to  an  enterprise –  either increase or  reduce the
common good – their use would be differentiated according to this very
criterion. Uses of financial profit which reduced the common good would
be restricted. This way the “excessive nature” of capitalism – accumulation
for  the  sake of  accumulation –  would be  channelled in  a  meaningful
direction. Use  of  financial gain  for  the  purpose of  hostile  takeovers,
demonstrations of power, exploitation, destruction of the environment and
crises would have to be halted altogether, whereas financial excess used to
create added social and ecological value and for making investments and
engaging in cooperation – in short, to increase the common good – would
be endorsed and even promoted. Such distinctions are made everywhere. I
may  use  a  knife to  cut  vegetables but  not  to  slay  human beings. Laws
regulate permissible and  forbidden use  of  tools and  the  conditions and
limits put  on  the  use  of  tools and  weapons. It  should be  the  same with
profits made by enterprises because in the Economy for the Common Good
such tools – like money in general – would constitute exactly that: mere
tools, not  the  goal  in  and  of  itself. Otherwise they  could become lethal
weapons.
## PERMISSIBLE USES OF PROFITS
## 1. Investments
A  large  proportion of  national economic investments is  financed  by  the
financial surplus, that is, the profits of enterprises. This may and should stay
the same in the future, for investments can have a beneficial effect which
increases the common good and enhances quality of life. It is necessary to
differentiate clearly  between tools and  goals, however,  because like  a

kitchen knife, investments can be used in different ways, for example to (a)
generate renewable forms of energy, produce bio-organic foods and offer
educational and healthcare services or to (b) slash and burn rainforests, start
up a mass livestock farm, manufacture gas-guzzling SUVs or make nuclear
weapons. Thus in the future such investments should only be made which
generate an added social or ecological value. To achieve this – analogous to
financial cost  calculations customarily made today –  a  Common Good
calculation would have to be made for every considerable-sized investment.
This way an additional instrument of the Common Good – in addition to the
one  which measures enterprises’  overall performance –  would have an
advance effect  on  investment decisions. This would prevent inhumane
production conditions from being created, environmental damage from
being incurred and high-risk technologies from being developed in the first
place. The structural core of this idea entered the political arena long ago;
various circles of society have proposed social impact, sustainability and
non-discrimination assessments and so forth. This should also be applied to
investment decisions made by  companies, for  just  as  laws  determine the
direction in which a democratic community develops, investment decisions
determine the direction which enterprises and the national economy take.
Such decisions should be  made  as  circumspectly as  possible, and  they
should definitely be  based on  a  more complex foundation of  assessment
than mere financial profitability, which is almost the only factor taken into
consideration when  decisions are  made today.  For  borrowing of  outside
capital, an  external audit conducted by  a  bank would be  necessary in
addition to an internal Common Good audit of the planned investment. The
Democratic Bank, which has already started to take shape since the first
edition of  this  book, in  the  form  of  the  Projekt Bank für  Gemeinwohl
(Project Bank for  Common Good), would not  only assess the  financial
standing of the credit applicant but also the added value for the Common
Good. Business plans of the future would look very different from how they
look today.
- Reserve assets
In  a  money market economy,  no  enterprise can  end  the  business year
without making either gains or  losses. Sometimes business goes better,
sometimes worse. That is  why  two  tools –  loss  carryforward (used for
balancing and tax declarations) and reserves for future losses – exist. Both

instruments should be used in the future as well so as to give enterprises a
certain amount of leeway. Reserves should be dependent upon two decisive
conditions, however. First of all, they should be restricted (for example to
five years and a small percentage of the turnover). Second, it should not be
permissible to use them for financial investments. Should they exist in the
form of liquid assets it should be required that they be deposited in a bank
with a Common Good orientation such as the Democratic Bank to prevent
them from being withdrawn from the money supply.
- Increase of capital
The third permissible use of financial surplus would be the paying back of
borrowed funds, that is, bank loans. A look at average equity quotas allows
us to presume that this use of financial surplus would not bring about any
great change of the current situation. Most enterprises are indebted to quite
or extremely high degrees, and the profits they make are not high enough to
pay back their debts. For such enterprises nothing much would change. In
the  Economy for  the  Common Good, however,  the  indebtedness of
enterprises would lose  two  of  its  negative aspects. The  Common Good
assessment of all loans would prevent destructive investments from being
financed and smoothen the pressure on the economy to grow because of
interest since it would be replaced by fixed-rate fees just large enough to
cover the operating and resilience costs of the bank involved.
- Dividend payouts to employees
If  a  year ended more successfully than anticipated, all  of  those who
contributed to this success can be rewarded financially. Incomes would be
limited to a certain multiple of the statutory minimum wage, however – and
this would apply to employed proprietors as well. Just how high the limit
should be  would be  worked out  by  the  economic convention and  the
democratic sovereign.
- Loans to other enterprises
Anyone wanting to help other enterprises, customers and suppliers could
grant them interest-free loans. Since cooperation would be  promoted
systematically, this form of direct (financial) solidarity would be promoted

as well. This would make cash transactions cheaper and enterprises would
save themselves the trouble of going to a bank and paying fees or interest.
## NON-PERMISSIBLE USES OF PROFITS
All of the above has been permitted in the past. What is decisive is the list
uses that would no longer be permissible:
- Financial investments
Enterprises should  earn  their income exclusively from the  products they
manufacture and/or the services they provide, not from financial operations.
A hairdresser is there to cut hair or do cosmetic treatments and not to make
money from money; a farm exists to produce healthy food and keep the
agrarian ecosystem stable and diverse, not to make money from money. A
bank should be there to convert saved money into reasonably priced loans,
not to make money from money. Today corporations have stopped being net
debtors and  turned into  net  creditors because they  no  longer earn  their
income with production alone but rather with casino bets, stock trading and
interest-rate business. Many industrial corporations are referred to as “large
banks with a small workbench”; the pharmaceutical giant Roche has been
called “a  large  bank with a  small pharmacy attached to  it”.
## 17
In  the
Economy for the  Common Good, money would only be  a  means for
production, no longer a means of making profit (Aristotle’s ‘chrematistics’).
Financial casinos would be a thing of the past. Financial assets except those
stored in the company safe would be deposited in non-profit-oriented banks
so that money could be put at the service of the common good and passed
on quickly and inexpensively to those currently in need of it as a resource.
In  the  Economy for  the  Common Good, money would always also
constitute a  part  of  public infrastructures and  not  only  private assets. It
would be a public good.
## 18
- Dividend payouts to proprietors who do not work in the enterprise
The core of capitalism is that some people – owners of capital, those with
power – appropriate the added value of work done by others – non-owners
of capital, the powerless ones – and they do so legally. This is what Marx
taught us in detail. The question is how it has happened that so few own so

much capital and  so  many so  little, and  what can  be  done about it  in
systemic terms. The tricky thing about the debate is that there are many
different ways to  acquire a  large  amount of  capital. Some of  them are
reconcilable with  all  the  basic values of  society (personal effort  coupled
with  consideration of  others and  the  bearing of  responsibility), whereas
others contradict such values to  the  extreme (ruthless greed and  lust  for
power, trickery, luck or the inheritance of large fortunes made without the
inheritors ever lifting a finger). The possibility of paying out dividends on
company earnings to people who have not participated in the value-adding
work process often fails to promote personal engagement and responsibility,
fostering dangerous tendencies instead:
•The decoupling of power and responsibility. Through the separation of
the proprietors of an enterprise who make the decisions and the
employees who work there, such free rein is given to irresponsibility that
this encourages unscrupulous behavior. Profitable sites are closed down,
thousands of jobs are destroyed, and long-term investments are
neglected, for example.
•Unjust distribution to the point of exploitation. Anonymity fosters
disproportion and excess. In recent years, the rates of profit in many
countries rose while wages stagnated. In 2010, seven of the thirty
corporations listed at the Frankfurt stock market paid out more money to
stockholders than the sum of the previous year’s profits. We are making
a transition from dividends to expropriation. At the same time large
corporations pay less and less tax and even receive tax credits.
•Meaningless motives. Profit can be a motive for founding a company in
which the founder takes no personal or creative interest.
•Concentration of power. If I may own a company that I do not work in,
I can own hundreds of companies and that makes me richer and more
powerful all the time (and the assets and the increase in power which
come with them become the goal, not the purpose). Inequitable
distribution of property by enterprises is a key source of inequality in
terms of income as well as assets.
It  would be  more responsible and  more just  in  terms of  performance to
make work the sole source of income and to keep decision-making power

primarily in the enterprise, and for this reason:
1.Capital should be only a means; its increase should not be the purpose
of running or founding an enterprise;
2.This means should be distributed more equitably than today, in
particular at the “start”, that is, the beginning of an individual’s working
life (“equal opportunities”);
3.Acquisition of capital should be coupled fundamentally with personal
performance and responsibility;
4.Return on investment should benefit those who contributed to it through
their work.
For this reason only those persons who work in a company should receive
income from company earnings. In the Economy for the Common Good
there would be a statutory maximum and minimum wage for every work
hour. The maximum wage could be seven, ten, twelve or twenty times the
minimum wage, for  example. Whoever worked longer hours  would be
allowed to earn more but for every individual hour – apart from special or
night shifts – there would be a defined maximum spread. The maximum
spread would be defined democratically – by the sovereign people.
The main purpose of limits on dividend payouts is to dry up a key source
of inequality and the concentration of power. If capital can be “poured out”
of enterprises, as the word for dividend payout in German (“Ausschüttung”)
suggests, then the “incentive” for owners to do this against the interests of
the enterprise and of the people who work there grows. A select few make
decisions and  harvest the  fruits  without even working in  the  company
themselves.
For the vast majority of enterprises, nothing would change through this
because they do not pay out dividends to persons outside the company. A
misunderstanding frequently arises here: today many small businesses look
upon themselves as “profit-oriented” and interpret the income they derive
from operating surplus as “profit” which is as such their own income. This
may and should stay that way in the future – the difference being, however,
that such income would be viewed as payment for people who work in the
company: as pay for the entrepreneur. (The aforementioned problem is not
that dividends are paid out to entrepreneurs who engage in the work of the

company but rather that they are paid to persons who do not.) The large
majority of business partnerships would generate such little “profit” that the
entrepreneur’s  income would lie  well below the  stipulated maximum
multiple of  the  statutory minimum wage. Such persons would not  be
affected by “limitation of profit” at all.
Those affected most would be  joint-stock companies. For  the
aforementioned reasons no  dividends should exist in  the  future. Several
factors regarding joint-stock companies are not very well-known: (a) stocks
contribute less and less to the financing of enterprises: in the USA the stock
market sucked more money out of joint-stock companies than it pumped
into  them for  the  entire course  of  the  1990s; in  France the  balance was
zero;
## 19
(b) innovative start-ups rarely get stock capital; usually relatives are
the ones who help out;
## 20
(c) in many joint-stock companies the connection
between property and responsibility has vanished.
Joint-stock companies were originally set up as special risk enterprises.
The owners were liable and had to put their entire assets at the disposal of
the  company as  a  form of  security.  In  1856, the  USA decided to  limit
personal liability to the measure of an entrepreneur’s financial participation
in his or her enterprise.
## 21
Today more and  more taxpayers are  liable for
shareholders when ailing banks and automobile manufacturers need to be
rescued, for  example. These owners, instead of  being obliged to  inject
additional capital into their staggering companies, are in fact rewarded by
the  taxpayers for  their poor economic performance and  their lack  of
responsibility. This promotes the tendencies of joint-stock companies to act
irresponsibly and ruthlessly and to undermine democracy.
A frequently asked question regarding this issue is why people would
put their savings at the disposal of a company if they cannot obtain any
financial return on investment any more. Who should take the risk of the
credit grantors upon themselves? Here is  a  systematic answer to  this
question: in the Economy for the Common Good, enterprises would be able
to acquire (financial) capital “externally” in four different ways:
1.Outside funding from Common Good-oriented banks. Since banks
would not pay out dividends or pay interest on savings, loans would be
less expensive on average because the credit fees would only need to
cover the operating costs of the bank. Moreover, the global financial

casino would be closed, and for this reason people’s assets would pile
up at the banks and be available in large quantities.
2.Equity. People could participate in businesses. The difference would be
that they would not receive any financial return on interest for doing so,
nor would they be able to sell their share on markets (stock markets).
They would have three advantages, however: (1) Meaning: they would
help create a purposeful enterprise. (2) Values: they would only invest
in companies with an excellent common good balance sheet. (3) Co-
determination: for their equity they would receive a (per capita) say in a
company and help shape it as they saw fit. Besides these three wins,
they would get their money back if they needed it – after all, it was not
a gift. Since from the perspective of the company it would constitute
cost-free capital (because no interest would have to be paid on it), and
hence be cheaper than a bank loan, the company would have a large
incentive to attract equity. In return, they would have to become very
appealing to investors. Since the magnet would no longer be money, it
would have to be something different: a social purpose and ethical
values! The most socially purposeful and ethically driven enterprises
would acquire enough capital, and the instrument that would help them
do this would be the Common Good Balance Sheet. All of a sudden the
entire system would be running in the right direction.
Since financial assets would increase constantly in proportion to the
economy, a growing part of private financial wealth would have to
embark on a “quest for meaning”. In other words, it would suffice to put
a part of one’s private financial assets at the disposal of an enterprise
free of charge because there would be increasing amounts of financial
assets.
3.Equity from endowments. This would be supplied by young
employees who contributed their “democratic dowry” to the enterprise,
increasing its equity in this way. The reform of inheritance law (Chapter
4) would make it possible for young people to contribute not only their
working power but also a certain measure of capital to the company.
4.Cost-free external funding. Enterprises could give each other interest-
free loans. They would be rewarded for doing so. Those who had more
than they needed would not receive interest from the bank any more.
Their profit would be the experience of solidarity and improvement of
their Common Good Balance Sheet.

In the Economy for the Common Good, money would play a different role
than  it  does today.  As  a  means  of  exchange and  equity for  one’s  own
company it would remain a predominantly private good, but as credit or
capital for other companies it would tend to become a public good.
- Hostile takeovers and mergers
The  third  non-permissible use  of  financial surplus would be  buyouts of
other enterprises against their  will. Through the  new orientation of
enterprises the most frequent motive for hostile takeovers would disappear;
if  enterprises are  no  longer profit-oriented, they quickly and  almost
automatically abandon growth orientation as their goal. It would no longer
be  necessary to  grow as  large  as  possible in  order to  (a)  obtain higher
profits, (b)  devour a  competitor  and  (c)  keep from being devoured by  a
competitor.
Generally speaking, there would be no more monetary growth goal in
business since growth would only constitute a means towards a new goal,
this being to make the largest possible contribution to the common good as
measured by  the  new  economic success indicators. Should investments,
increases in returns or friendly mergers serve this goal, then they would be
welcome. In the event of a planned merger, a yet-to-be-defined majority of
the employees, managers and owners of the two companies involved would
have to approve it, however. This would put an end to hostile takeovers
which – in the dictatorship of those with the most capital – are common
practice today.
- Party donations
It would be forbidden for enterprises to finance political parties or members
of parliaments. Only individuals would be allowed to do so – perhaps up to
a maximum amount.
Conversely, corporate property tax could be eliminated. The state should
have no interest in high profits and should not participate in the pursuit of
profit as a goal either. And taxing a means which brings benefits does not
really make sense anyway. Or, alternatively, the corporate profit tax could
be scaled according to the common good balance sheet result.

## THE END OF THE COMPULSION TO GROWTH
This reorientation of  financial  profits would be  used to  redirect the
entrepreneurial pursuit of  success. Profit maximization would be  neither
desirable nor in fact achievable. There would be no “profit distribution” any
more; for incomes there would be lower and upper limits, hostile takeovers
would be  forbidden and  success would be  measured in  terms of  the
## Common Good Balance Sheet.
Through the sum of these measures the growth compulsion in business
would be eliminated, as such a compulsion results from the combination of
“measuring success with a  monetary indicator” (=  pursuit of  financial
profit) and  competition. If  I  compete with other enterprises,  my  profit
margin  must be  higher than  theirs  because otherwise my  rating will  be
worse, my financing costs will increase and I will be devoured in no time.
Just how decisive financial profit is for the survival of a company is often
underestimated. The success of an enterprise is determined by a plenitude
of  influential factors  such  as  quality,  innovation,  efficiency,  ethics,
scrupulousness, size,  flexibility ...  But  there is  only  one  single  decisive
condition: financial profit. At the end of the day financial profit determines
the success or failure of a company, irrespective of quality, innovative force,
size, marketing, social responsibility and all other factors.
And growth serves to yield higher profits than the competitors do, to
ward off hostile takeovers, or to devour others. Growth is intrinsic to the
system if it is programmed for pursuit of profit and competition.
Hence the  reprogramming. If  success were no  longer equated with
financial profit and  companies  were not  allowed to  devour each other,
enterprises could finally find out what size is “optimal” and purposeful for
them in a composed, anxiety-free fashion and then strive to reach it. The
capitalistic system dynamics would disappear and  everyone would be
liberated from the general compulsion to grow and devour each other!
## OPTIMAL SIZE
“Anyone who  believes exponential growth can  go  on  forever  in  a  finite
world is either a madman or an economist, “This is how the award-winning
US economist Kenneth Boulding puts it.
## 22
For many of his colleagues this

view remains inacceptable: “One must put  things right: sustainable
development is synonymous with the greatest possible long-term economic
growth”; this is the claim made by the former Dean of Political Economics
at Vienna University of Economics, Erich Streissler.
## 23
What I deem to be
the most valuable insight on the topic of growth comes from the political
scientist Leopold Kohr, who observes that in nature growth is a means of
reaching the optimal size.
## 24
This is exactly what the focus should be on in
business: enterprises striving to reach the optimal size. Today growth is a
goal in  and  of  itself, but  tomorrow it  would merely be  a  means. If
something is too small, it is fine for it to get larger. If an enterprise has
become hypertrophic, however,  like  a  bank “too  big  to  fail”, then  the
optimal change in size is negative. In the Economy for the Common Good
negative growth would be no problem as long as use values – values of the
common good – grow. In the currently dominant economic order this would
constitute a  huge disaster,  however,  for  shrinking is  synonymous with
recession and depression.
The human organism – like those of all other living creatures – illustrates
well  the  role  which growth could meaningfully play: up  to  an  “optimal
size” we  grow materially.  From  a  certain point on,  this  type  of  growth
ceases. Then development shifts to  the  non-material dimensions: to
emotional, social, intellectual and spiritual maturation. Human beings are
not  less  “successful” because they do  not  keep growing physically
throughout their lifetime. And they are not less happy either.
## STRUCTURAL COOPERATION
The mental exercise posed by the Economy for the Common Good which is
perhaps the most difficult to perform is the paradigm shift from competition
to cooperation, which is to say that enterprises would no longer need to act
in  opposition to  one  another and  would be  rewarded for  refraining from
doing so.
Some readers will  certainly have  a  hard time digesting this  because
today it is looked upon as “normal” for competitors to seek to damage or
even liquidate each other. Thus it would actually be more fitting to speak of
“counter-petition”, because “competition” comes from the Latin words cum
(together) and petere (search), which would actually be a much more apt

equivalent of the word “cooperation”. It stands for the common search – of
market participants – for the best solution for all. Is it not self-evident that
“searching against each  other” cannot be  efficient? Group intelligence is
higher than  anyone’s  individual intelligence. Almost all  great technical
developments derive from the contributions of many, not merely that of a
single human being. Scientific advance is the result of the cooperation of
countless researchers and thinkers over the course of history.
In  the  Economy  for  the  Common Good, competition would not  be
eliminated. The  Economy for  the  Common Good would be  a  form of
market economy and  as  such would be  based on  some of  its  present
foundations: private enterprises  (=  market) and  money as  means of
exchange. As long as there is a right to found enterprises and the possibility
of  going  bankrupt there will  always inevitably be  the possibility of
“counter-petition”. If it is promoted and stoked, the economy becomes a
battlefield. If on the other hand it is placed at a disadvantage by a legal
framework of incentives, it can become almost invisible within the primary
structure of cooperation.
Thus in  the  Economy for  the  Common Good competition would be
possible. (Theoretically competition would even be possible in an economy
based completely on solidarity: the cooperatives might violate their ethos
and start to compete with each other. This is due to the fact that everyone
would have  the  same freedom to  found a  cooperative.) But  the  more
businesses there were that  stuck their elbows out,  the  more aggressively
they  acted against  each  other,  the  poorer their Common Good Balance
Sheets would become as a result. The more cooperative their conduct was
and the more helpful they were to each other, the better the result of their
Common Good Balance Sheet would be  and  the  greater the  probability
would be that they would survive – not at the cost of others but rather to
their benefit. The current win–lose order would be replaced by a win–win
order.
How can enterprises help each other? As with neighbours and friends,
there are many different ways, for example:
•by sharing their knowledge according to the open-source principle and
with the help of creative commons licences;
•by helping each other out with labour;
•by passing on contracts;

•by providing cost-free loans and liquidity equalization.
They can also help each other by doing away with hostile opposition, for
example by refraining from:
•advertising in mass media (setting up transparent-egalitarian product
information systems instead);
•using dumping prices to conquer and secure markets;
•using blocking patents;
•devouring each other.
If enterprises were rewarded for mutual aid, then structural opposition and
the currently practised destructive competition and cannibalism would turn
into  peaceful coexistence at  least,  and  in  the  best  case  (thanks to  legal
incentives) be  replaced by  active cooperation. Whoever thinks this  is  an
invitation to cartelization continues to subscribe to the capitalistic logic of
today.  Today cartels are  not  ends in  themselves but  rather means of
increasing profits. If profits were limited and used to increase the common
good, then cartelization as a means would lose all its meaning. Cooperation,
on  the  other hand, is  an  efficient means of  fulfilling the  aim  of
entrepreneurialism more successfully.  Suddenly cooperation would no
longer contradict the ultimate goal of business, but rather harmonize with it.
Pursuit of  optimal size  and  thus  abandonment of  growth as  a  goal  in
itself would increase the  willingness of  many enterprises to  engage in
cooperation. This is because an enterprise which has reached its optimal
size  has  a  much easier time divulging its  know-how and  passing on
contracts. From evolution we have learned that (a) more and more species
are evolving, and (b) the individual specimens of the species that exist do
not  always  get  bigger.  The  Harvard mathematician and  biologist Martin
Nowak writes: “Cooperation is the chief architect of evolution.”
## 25
## BANKRUPTCY
A  third aspect of  the  Economy for  the  Common Good –  in  addition to
money and private (productive) equity – which indicates that it constitutes a

form of market economy is the possibility of bankruptcy. But in comparison
to capitalistic economies based on competition, bankruptcy would be less
probable because:
1.the tendency would be for only enterprises with a higher purpose to be
founded since profit as a motive for founding enterprises would
disappear;
2.in democratic enterprises employees would tend to pull together and,
through mutual ways of handling things, bankruptcy could be prevented
more effectively;
3.third, and most important, enterprises would cooperate more and
compete less (they would be rewarded for this, not be compelled to do
so).
Enterprises that  refused to  engage in  cooperation or  only  met  minimum
statutory standards would tend to have poorer prospects for success. Such
enterprises would face the largest threat of bankruptcy. Due to their poor
Common Good Balance Sheet score they would fail to win the trust of the
consumers and investors and also lose out on legal advantages, incurring
relatively severe disadvantages compared to  other enterprises that  were
capable of  cooperating and  taking responsibility instead. The  situation
would be exactly the opposite of what it is today, with unscrupulous wage
squeezers, polluters and  tax  evaders gaining cost  benefits and  thus  also
competitiveness. Today, power and size often win out over quality – and
values.
## COOPERATIVE MARKET REGULATION
The Economy for the Common Good is a market economy, not a centrally
planned one.  If  implemented, there would be  market fluctuations in  the
future as well. It could happen that the demand in a certain sector suddenly
nosedived or the supply soared due to the market entry of new enterprises.
(Increases in demand and drops in supply would presumably pose no big
problem for  enterprises.) What  would happen in  the  Economy  for  the
Common Good if there were a need for fewer enterprises or at least fewer
work hours due to declines in demand or technological innovation?

Let’s begin by looking at what the classic reaction would be today: the
increasingly “tough” competition would get tougher and tougher and all the
competitors would try to undercut each other’s prices until one or several of
them – in the worst case all simultaneously – gave up, declared bankruptcy
or  were  taken over.  Today’s  market competition is  a  win–lose economic
order.
In the Economy for the Common Good all enterprises in the affected
sectors that  were willing to  cooperate could convene a  “crisis or
cooperation commission” and mutually discuss whether it would benefit the
common good best if they:
1.reduced all work hours proportionally;
2.cut workplaces proportionally and organized retraining measures;
3.downsized one enterprise considerably or made joint efforts to equip it
for a new task;
4.closed down an enterprise and found alternative workplaces for those
affected;
5.facilitated the voluntary merger of two enterprises into a smaller overall
unit – on condition that this enterprise was not too large (this to be
judged according to “objective” = societal/legal criteria as well as
“subjective” = democratic criteria).
Or  they  could find  other ways to  deal  with the  situation. It  would be
advisable for  the  regional economic parliament to  participate in  finding
systemic solutions.  If  labour were urgently needed in  other  sectors,
retraining measures could be organized.
Even if all options were exhausted, one could not always prevent some
enterprises from being eliminated. In the Economy for the Common Good,
projects too might fail; room for “risk” – and freedom – would remain. But
whereas today the  enterprise with  the  poorest financial results would be
eliminated –  irrespective of  quality,  ecological mindfulness and  social
responsibility – in the Economy for the Common Good the enterprise with
the poorest Common Good Balance Sheet would have to go – the one that
had been unwilling to do something for the community, to cooperate with
others or to let itself be helped by others.

The  decisive difference from today would be  that  enterprises would
proceed in a solidarity-minded way and attempt to keep everyone in the
boat  –  whereas  it  is  currently permissible to  throw others overboard or
devour them.
## THE COMMON GOOD AND GLOBALIZATION
Many of those who attend my lectures are worried that ethical enterprises
would immediately be swept off the market by global competition, arguing
that “the entire world” would have to participate to make the Economy for
the  Common Good work. This  perspective is  proof of  the  successful
indoctrination of  ideologists and  of  those who profit from the  current
economic order, which they depict as “natural” or “without any alternative”,
while failing to  recognize the  political roots of  such unfair (site-related)
competition, “free trade” and  free  movement of  capital. In  a  free  trade
regime the most ethical enterprises do indeed lose out; this is exactly the
error of  this  system. Good conduct and  loyalty to  the  constitution are
punished. “Free trade” favours enterprises that  disregard and  violate the
laws and values achieved in the EU (member states) democratically rather
than those enterprises that venerate and observe such laws and values. If
both kinds of  enterprises are  admitted to  the  market under  identical
conditions there is no question which will win out. Free trade is a political
invitation to site relocations and the export of workplaces. How low must
the  self-esteem of  a  democratic commonwealth be  which undermines its
own rules and regulations by making free trade agreements with countries
which have  no  such regulations themselves? Free trade violates the
constitution!
I  see  two  possible  solutions. The  first  would be  a  global regulatory
approach. A  mutual framework  –  standards for  labour practices, social
affairs, consumer protection, the environment, taxation and transparency –
would have to be in place before economic liberties were granted. For this
approach the United Nations, as the heart of international law, would be the
best regulating body.
Concrete implementation could look like this: a UN member state would
grant all countries free trade which fulfilled the UN Civil and Social Pacts
(both human rights conventions), the  International Labour Organization

labour standards, the multilateral environmental agreements including the
Climate Convention, the  UNESCO Convention for  the  Protection of
Cultural Diversity and  the  (future) agreement on  automatic information
exchange of fiscal data. For each agreement that has not been ratified, there
would be an extra tariff, for instance:
UN Civil Pact
+ 20% tariff
UN Social Pact
+ 20% tariff
UN Climate Convention
+ 20% tariff
Other UN environmental agreement
+ 10% tariff
Single ILO core labour standard
+ 5% tariff
UNESCO Convention
+ 10% tariff
Automatic information exchange of fiscal data
+ 20% tariff
The  second approach would be  an  incentive-based Economy for  the
Common Good, which would obligate all enterprises to draw up a Common
Good Balance Sheet. The better the result, the “fairer” the trade, the “freer”
market access would be.  Free  trade would be  a  privilege of  the  fairest
enterprises. The less fair or ethical an enterprise was, the higher the ethical
protective duty would be. This would put an end to unfair competition and
location competition. The greatest advantage of the second approach would
be that the EU would not need to wait for an agreement to be drawn up by
the  UN;  instead, as  the  largest  and  most powerful economic area  in  the
world, it could easily venture going it alone. The best solution would be a
parallel strategy combining the  two  approaches: while protecting the
domestic market through a  differentiated customs regime, the  EU  would
urge for fair and binding trade regulations in the framework of the UNO.
This would not even be a new approach. After all, the EU was the body that
pushed through the free trade conditions currently in effect – the those that
violate human rights, hamper development and  ignore the need for
sustainability. Thus the prerequisite for the vision put forth here would be
radical democratization of the EU.
So long as there were countries which did not go along with this, the EU
could begin with a group of pioneer nations: with a Common Good Zone.
This would be a fair-trade zone which agreed on mutual social, ecological
and  taxation regulations. And which protected itself from countries in

which such regulations did not exist. This would be a completely legitimate
form of protection – of protecting the constitution!
## SOCIAL SECURITY AND WORK LEAVES
So long as the possibility of bankruptcy remains, it can happen that human
beings lose  their place of  gainful  employment and  thus  their source of
income. This is one of the reasons why, in an Economy for the Common
Good, all people would take off one year for every decade of employment
and find fulfilment in other ways during that time. For a person who spent
forty years of his or her life working that would amount to four free years.
This would – if everybody participated – reduce the pressure on the job
market by about 10 percent, and the current unemployment in the EU would
be  eliminated altogether.  Those  taking time out  would be  “on  leave”.
During this time they could receive, for example, 80 percent of the average
income of  the  past  five  working years or  income set  in  some other
democratic way. By allowing all human beings to take such a “work leave”,
envy would no longer be an issue; everyone would have equal rights and no
one would have to finance the others. This life opportunity would not only
elevate the  self-esteem of  many human beings who are  currently
unemployed but  also  increase the  general feeling of  freedom, for  these
years could be used to train for new skills, devote oneself to one’s family,
engage in  art,  find  leisure, enjoy nature or  embrace other passions. The
status of productive labour and  gainful employment would be  reduced
while the appreciation for other purposes in life would increase.
I  am  confident that  these four  years of  leave would provide a  higher
degree of social security than today because the number of those who failed
to make it in the system would decline. In the Economy for the Common
Good, enterprises would not strive to downsize the number of employees in
order to increase profit. In general, new employees would be more welcome
in  enterprises than  they  are  today.  Moreover the  enterprises would join
forces to  help those willing to  work to  actually find  a  job;  the  legal
incentives for  doing so  would be  in  place in  any  case. As  the  system
dynamics would  prioritize giving rather than  taking, the  systemic result
would not  be  scarcity but  rather plenitude. And in  addition  the  large
majority of the working population would be much more highly motivated

to work because they would be allowed to help shape and participate in the
success of  their enterprise. Finally,  the  motivation to  engage in  the
production process would increase as well because working hours and the
work environment would be  more humane in  general. In  light  of  such
changed conditions, the  need  for  unemployment benefits, emergency
assistance and income support would be considerably reduced.
## SOLIDARITY INCOME
Nevertheless, a  sort  of  solidarity income for  individuals who, despite
searching hard, do not find any occupation, in the range of for example two
thirds of  the  minimum wage, should be  considered. The  practice of  the
Economy for  the  Common Good would show if  it  is  needed or  not.  In
keeping with  the  democratic approach of  the  Economy for  the  Common
Good, a  guaranteed basic income or  a  Common Good currency
(“Gradido”)
## 26
could  be  an  element of  the  economic order.  Let  the  best
alternative be found and implemented!
For  people  with special needs or  restrictions who  cannot engage in
gainful employment at  all  or  can  do  so  only  to  a  limited degree, there
should also be a guaranteed basic income, sufficient to allow them to live
their lives in dignity.
## SECURE PENSIONS
Coupling pensions with financial markets was one of the greatest political
mistakes of the neoliberal era. The hope of profiting from capital income –
albeit to  a  relatively insignificant degree –  which was  held  by  broad
sections of  the  population blurred  one  of  the  fundamental conflicts of
interest in  capitalist society,  namely that  which prevails between the
minority which appropriates the lion’s share of all capital income and the
minority which generates and pays for it.
Privatizing pensions does not  make them more secure, more socially
equitable, or less expensive – in fact the opposite is true on all three counts.
I have researched and discussed this issue elsewhere.
## 27
For this reason I
would like  to  propose this  alternative: in  the  Economy for  the  Common

Good the discredited intergenerational contract would be rehabilitated and
the  time-proven contribution-based model would be  strengthened. This
would certainly be possible, despite the widespread belief to the contrary
generated by  propagandistic brainwashing –  as  the  feasibility of
contribution-based pensions depends on  not  less  than ten  regulatory
measures: level of  income, increase in  productivity,  labour force
participation rate, unemployment, wage share in national income, rate of
contribution, tax  grants, state of  health, pension entry age, and  life
expectancy. Demographic change, which poses insoluable problems for the
profit-based model, could be  cushioned completely by  adjusting several
such measures if the contribution-based model were used.
## 28
The population
has been ageing rapidly for over a hundred years but this never caused a
financial problem  for  pensions until the private insurance  sector spread
what is probably the greatest myth (the demographic time bomb), cashing
in on it. In the Economy for the Common Good there would be no more
profit-oriented banks and insurance companies; the financial system would
become a  public good. This  is  one  important reason why  (contribution-
based) pensions would be secure. For all other aspects of social security,
like childcare benefits or maternity pay, the welfare state would remain the
same in the Economy for the Common Good.
To  sum  up,  the  “core” of  the  Economy for  the  Common Good model
consists of  redirecting economic activity towards a  values-based,
cooperative system, turning money into (a) a mere means and (b) a public
good; streamlining  the  use  of  financial profits according to  these new
values; fostering cooperation instead of “counter-petition”; giving priority
to  ethical entrepreneurs, investors and  consumers; and  lowering the
significance of gainful employment relative to other social dimensions of
life, without lowering the level of social security. Some key elements of a
complete economic  order are  still  missing: the  financial system and,
especially, banks, as well as the case of property. The next two chapters will
deal with these issues.

## THREE
## THE DEMOCRATIC BANK
## 1
The Economy for the Common Good requires an entirely different financial
system to  the  one  in  use  today.  The  liberalization and  globalization of
financial markets have made banks appallingly inefficient – measured in
terms of  their benefit for  society and  the  common good –  and  these
developments have  also  diverted them to  a  perilous degree from their
(supposed) core task, this task being to convert savings into loans and make
these available to  local enterprises, households and  communities. Profit-
oriented global-player banks fail to perform such core tasks to a satisfactory
degree, if at all. They:
•cannot guarantee savings;
•loan money at expensive rates or not at all (creating “credit squeezes”);
•increase account management fees and in some countries, such as the
UK, close current accounts if customers refuse to buy stocks or bonds;
•thin out their network of branch offices and reduce basic services
providing personal customer care.
Instead they do business which:
•undermines the stability of the financial system: leveraging, issuing
derivatives, credit trade, currency speculation;
•create bank money, although they are only supposed to convert existing
savings into loans, and thus contribute to the inflation of the money
supply and consequent financial bubbles;

•redistribute resources from the masses to the moneyed via high-yield
funds, exorbitant bonuses and dividends, abetment of tax evasion,
assistance in building up large structures and concentration of power;
•encumber the state by allowing it to rescue them with taxpayers’ money
instead of making the owners (shareholders) accountable for financial
losses.
Closer inspection reveals that “global financial markets” are a contradiction
in  themselves; on  liberalized markets banks tend  to  strive for  a  globally
competitive size. This is even the express goal of the EU’s internal financial
market and the world market for financial services in the framework of the
## World Trade Organization.
## 2
But this automatically makes them “too big to
fail”, which in turn means that several fundamental market rules cease to
hold: (1) bankruptcy: system banks are condemned to live forever; (2) fair
competition vanishes.
The “market” as such ceases to exist for other reasons as well:
•savings are guaranteed by the state;
•state-run central banks take responsibility for refinancing banks;
•system stability is also ensured by the state;
•shareholders are not liable when system-relevant banks go bankrupt, but
rather the taxpayers are.
To make matters worse, the power of these “global players” has increased
to  such a  degree that  they  can  successfully protect themselves against
fragmentation, regulation and taxation. They want neither a market nor a
democracy.  The  detriment they  do  to  the  common good outweighs the
benefits they  bring. They are  not  only  economically but  also  politically
system-relevant (“too big  to  jail”) and  as  such they  are  detrimental to
democracy.
For this reason the Economy for the Common Good would be founded
on an entirely different financial system. Money as credit would become a
public good and the financial markets would be closed. This is what would
happen to the individual gaming tables in the global financial casino:

•Asset management. There would be no more funds. People would
deposit their financial assets at the Democratic Bank, a common-good-
oriented cooperative bank or a savings bank which only did deposit and
lending business. People would live on earned income, not on capital
income. In return, their assets would be secure and stable. They would be
guaranteed without restriction.
•Stock markets. Regional common good stock markets would replace
central capitalistic ones. They would finance enterprises but not trade
them. Dividends would be non-financial and oriented to values and goals
of economic activity (rather than to means). Stock companies of the
future would list regional (for example foodstuffs, energy) or global (for
example software, high-tech) enterprises with citizen participation, a
commitment to ethical conduct, a real purpose and the willingness and
ability to generate use values.
•Government bonds. If they even still existed (I have made a proposal
for an alternative form of financing public debts in another place),
## 3
they
would no longer be traded but instead would be merely held with
democratically fixed interest rates. The Democratic Central Bank would
take charge of financing the public debt – up to a defined cap – on an
interest-free basis.
## 4
•Investment banks. Derivatives such as loan securitizations, credit
default swaps (CDS), commodity and currency derivative debits would
no longer exist.
•Rating agencies. If shares, bonds, credits and derivatives were no longer
tradable or in existence, such ratings would be unnecessary. The agencies
would be unemployed.
•Futures exchanges and commodity markets. Commodity prices would
be fixed democratically by a commission of producers, consumers and
representatives for future generations who would meet at eye level and
negotiate humane prices for all sides.
•Currency markets. The “globo” or “terra” would be introduced as the
world trade (or reserve) currency and the exchange rates of all national
currencies would be “flexibly fixed” to it (following a proposal made by
## John Maynard Keynes).
## 5
The Democratic Bank would exchange
currencies at a uniform exchange rate.

This way the major “gaming tables” of the global financial casino, that is,
the  global financial market, would be  closed. The  core  functions of  the
financial markets would be fulfilled by the Democratic Bank and regional
common good stock markets as  well as  by  further measures  taken to
achieve more equitable distribution of income and capital.
## GOALS AND SERVICES
The Democratic Bank would be committed to the common good rather than
to  profit gain. Its  values and  goals would be  identical to  those of  the
Economy for the Common Good. In particular, regional economic channels
and socially and ecologically sustainable investments would be promoted.
The Democratic Bank would provide the following core services:
1.unlimited guarantees on savings;
2.a low-cost current account for each resident (that, with positive money
reform, would be totally safe against losses);
3.inexpensive loans for enterprises and private households in cases of (a)
economic solvency and (b) creation of ecological and social added
value through investments;
4.a full-scale network of branches with respectful personal customer care
in synergy with the Democratic Postal Office, the Democratic Railway
Company, public internet docks;
5.inexpensive supplementary loans to the state and brokering of
government bonds;
6.currency exchange.
These goals and services could be laid down in the constitution with the
stipulation that  they  could only  be  changed by  the  owner itself –  the
democratic sovereign –  by  referendum. The  government and  parliament
would have no access to the Democratic Bank. Directives and regulations
(of the EU or the WTO) which stood in opposition to sovereign regulation
of the bank would have to be abolished.
## TRANSPARENCY AND SECURITY

All business conducted by the Democratic Bank would appear on the bank’s
balance sheet; establishment of branch offices or special-purpose entities in
tax  havens  would be  prohibited. The  Democratic Bank would not  be
allowed to issue money (cf. the term “positive money” coined by Joseph
Huber and James Robertson);
## 6
its role would be limited to handling money
between savers and borrowers. The bank would be obligated to adhere to
legal equity regulations but allowed to operate on the time-tested principle
of good faith of the traditional banking system and to adopt anti-cyclical
lending policies in times of crisis. If  the  situation were to  become more
difficult for enterprises in such times, the Democratic Bank would be more
generous. It  would have sufficient capital to  do  so.  It  would fulfil a
macroeconomic purpose –  contrary to  an  approach seeking the
maximization of self-interest.
## FINANCING, REFINANCING, BANKRUPTCY
The  bank would finance itself through lending fees  to  cover its  costs
(including credit losses, which on  average would amount to  less  than  1
percent of the credit). The employees of the Democratic Bank would have a
high degree of social security and comprehensive co-determination rights.
They would make a decent living – as with all “democratic commons”. The
maximum income spread between the top and lowest-paid earners within
the bank would be 1:10. Such a maximum degree of inequality was agreed
upon for all public banks by the Parliament of the Swiss Canton Aargau in
early 2013.
The  bank  would grant loans by  drawing on  deposits from private
persons, enterprises and the state. Since these financial assets are growing
steadily in  relation to  GDP,  sufficient credit would be  available (for
refinancing measures).
Should the  savings of  a  community,  region or  federal state prove
insufficient for  covering all  socially and  ecologically purposeful credit
applications, other banks whose savings deposits exceeded the  credit
amount would distribute these to  other banks. The  Central Bank would
accept liability for the risk of such distribution. It would act as the “ultimate
lender”. It is highly unlikely that any branch of the Democratic Bank would
go bankrupt because:

1.the bank would not be profit-oriented, thus constituting a low-risk
business;
2.its business activity would restrict itself to the “conservative” credit
business; it would not trade securities and/or derivatives;
3.legal security regulations hold for granting loans;
4.the executive board would be personally liable if they did not abide by
the laws;
5.a supervisory board elected on a direct democratic basis would monitor
and control the activities of the executive board;
6.the executive board would also be accountable to the sovereign people
and could be unelected at any time.
Nevertheless individual cases of bankruptcy could occur if a large number
of loans were to be lost simultaneously. In such an event the Central Bank
would prevent bankruptcy through recapitalization. The Democratic Bank
would be “too essential to fail”, just like schools, universities, railways and
hospitals. Such institutions cannot go bankrupt today either.
## INTEREST AND INFLATION
There would be no interest rates for loans or savings in the conventional
sense. The borrowers would pay a loan fee rated in such a way as to allow
the bank to cover its costs including investments and payments into a fund
for social projects. Beyond this, credit costs would not generate profit for
the bank or provide income for depositors.
The “real” Bank for the Common Good, which is currently being set up
in  Austria, will  pay  a  moderate  interest rate  on  savings initially.  It
encourages its customers to do without interest on savings from the very
start, however,  so  as  to  make it  possible to  carry out  socially and
ecologically valuable projects whose credit costs would be reduced in this
way. It actively informs people of the effects of the interest rate system.
In various publications I have elaborated three main reasons why I am in
favour of eliminating interest altogether:

1.About 90 percent of the population lose out as a result of the interest
system because they pay more for credit interest than they gain in
savings interest. But most people do not realize this because the banks
do not inform them of such costs. On World Savings Day all we hear
about is the interest on savings deposits which we receive. The fact that
we pay for this interest ourselves through our daily purchases because
credit users add their credit costs onto the amount they demand for their
goods is something banks conceal from us. It is as if they only showed
us one side of the balance sheet. On World Savings Day the Democratic
Bank would hand out a “personal interest calculator” which could be
used to calculate whether you belonged to the small elite of net interest
winners or to the large majority of net interest losers. Then a
constitutional majority of interest opponents would soon be found.
2.Capital income of all kinds, not only interest on savings, triggers a
compulsion to grow because credit users must pay back more money
than they borrow. The carrying capacity of the earth has already been
exceeded, however. The ecological footprint of humankind is already
larger than the planet can handle long-term. Systemic drivers of growth
should be removed from the economic order.
3.Mathematically speaking, it is not possible for the interest yield of the
sum of savings deposits to match even the degree of inflation in the
longer run. Every year in which the growth of monetary assets exceeds
that of the real economic output – and this happens whenever (a) the
savings rate or (b) the rate of return on capital exceeds the growth rate –
a larger part of the annual economic output is needed to pay the same
amount of interest on the monetary assets. Let me illustrate this point: if
the monetary assets were currently one hundred times larger than the
real economic output, the entire GDP would be needed to pay interest
on the monetary assets at a nominal rate of 1 percent. If there were an
inflation rate of 1.5 percent, it would no longer be possible to preserve
the value of the monetary assets. Mathematically speaking, interest
claims can no longer be redeemed once a certain (multiple) ratio
between financial assets and GDP (in “mature” national economies) has
been reached.
Therefore the  Democratic Bank  would inform the  public about the
consequences that interest on savings in particular and returns on capital in

general would have for the national economy and society at large, and they
would prepare society for the end of “idle” capital income. Instead of using
phrases such as  “Let  your money work for  you” to  erect a  wall  of  fog
between savers and  their investments, the  Democratic Bank would
encourage savers to “Look and see what is happening with your money”.
Since in the Economy for the Common Good there would be no more
compulsion to grow, inflation might indeed vanish. This would also solve
the problem of currency devaluation, and loans would be even cheaper if no
interest had to be paid on the savings deposits to “compensate for inflation”.
## SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL CREDIT ASSESSMENT
When loans are  granted, knowledge of  the  local situation and  the
entrepreneurial protagonists should play a role, not some anonymous rating.
Credit applications would no  longer be  assessed exclusively in  terms of
economic profitability but  rather  in  regard to  their added social and
ecological value.  For  this  Common Good Creditworthiness Assessment,
legal regulations would be  applied, just  like  those for  economic credit
assessments. The principle of  a  Common Good Creditworthiness
Assessment would be similar to that used for the Common Good Balance
Sheet which the Bank for the Common Good project is now developing on
the basis of existing instruments. Planned investments with a particularly
large  social  and  ecological added value would be  awarded loans free  of
charge or even with “negative interest”, that is, they would not even have to
pay back the full credit sum. In contrast, borrowers whose projects merely
met  the  minimum legal requirements would pay  correspondingly high
charges for credit. Projects that created a reduced social or ecological value
– for example stalls for thousands of animals or a nuclear power plant –
would get  no  loan  at  all  even  if  they  were highly profitable  business
operations. The  ethical guidelines would be  elaborated by  the  economic
conventions and decided by the sovereign people. In this way the financial
market would finally also function as a steering instrument for socially and
ecologically sustainable development. “Ethical investment” would become
a legal standard.

## ECO-SOCIAL VENTURE CAPITAL AND COMMON GOOD
## STOCK MARKETS
Projects whose profitability is uncertain hope to find financing options on
stock markets and in other segments of the venture capital market but such
markets lack any social and ecological awareness. A risk department of the
Democratic Bank could adopt this function, devoting itself exclusively to
innovations with an added social and ecological value. Each Democratic
Bank could set aside a small percentage of its savings deposits for use as
eco-social venture capital. A  democratically elected ethics commission
could decide which projects were particularly worthy of being funded and
grant loans to them. Greater precautions could be taken for such projects.
A  second –  more market-oriented –  possibility would be  to  establish
regional Common Good stock markets which could be supported by all the
banks in  the  region. The mechanism would be  as  follows: credit
applications that were ethical but failed to pass a financial credit assessment
would be passed along to such a stock market. People could participate in
the project directly if the enterprise served a good purpose, generated use
values and furnished proof of ethical conduct (via a Common Good Balance
Sheet). Companies from the region that were certain of the project’s success
in  terms of  these criteria could go  straight to  the  stock market. The
advantage for the entrepreneurs would be that they would receive equity
free  of  charge.  The  advantage for  the  financial investors would be  use
values and being able to have a say in a project with a social and ethical
purpose. These would be the motives for making investments in the future.
## SUBSIDIARITY, DEMOCRACY, REGULATION,
## TRANSPARENCY
The Democratic Bank would have a subsidiary structure. Most of the loans
would be  granted at  the  communal level. The  Democratic Banks would
make decisions autonomously. At the communal level the board would be
elected on the basis of direct democracy, just like the supervisory board (the
Democratic Bank Council) which would be in charge of overseeing it. The
Democratic Bank Council would be made up of employee representatives,
consumers, debtors, small regional  businesses as  well  as  gender equality

officers and an ombudsperson for the future. All bodies would be filled with
an equal number of women and men and reflect ethnic diversity goals.
The state  or  federal level would be  responsible for  large-scale
investments and governmental loans but they would be proportionately co-
financed at the local level. Excess savings deposits would be passed on to
these higher levels as required. In case of excess wealth, financial assets
could also simply be deposited in banks – if there were no real socially
purposeful use for them.
## 7
Representatives of local banks would elect the executive board and the
supervisory board at  the  state level from their own  ranks; these bodies
would in turn elect the executive board and the supervisory board at the
federal level. Head offices would only be  responsible for  liquidity
equalization and  for  granting large-scale loans. They would not  trade in
securities, derivatives or any other assets. The state and federal levels would
not be hierarchically placed over the communal level but rather have equal
rights, constituting autonomous elements of the Federation of Democratic
Banks. All elected representatives would be accountable to the sovereign
people and  could be  de-elected  by  it  at  any  time. All  bodies of  the
Democratic Bank would meet in public.
Transparency coupled with co-determination would be a central feature
of the Democratic Bank. Transparency generates trust. The balance sheet
along with all credit transactions would be accessible to the public – with
only a few well-defined exceptions.
Private accounts  and  money transfers would be  subject to  data
protection, however.  Only tax-relevant data would be  automatically
transferred to tax authorities (as is currently done with earned income in
many countries).This regulation would have to apply for all banks so as to
prevent the Democratic Bank from being at a competitive disadvantage.
## RELATIONSHIP TO PRIVATE BANKS
So as not to subject the Democratic Bank to unfair competition, other banks
would only  exist  in  non-profit-oriented legal forms such as  cooperatives
and  savings banks. Investment  banks would cease to  exist. During the
transitional phase the  following  governmental guarantees and  advantages
would only be provided to common-good-oriented banks:

•deposit guarantees;
•refinancing through the central bank;
•business with the state;
•recapitalization in the event of insolvency.
Whereas profit-oriented banks would be left to their own devices on the
free market, with all these governmental forms of support being withdrawn.
During a  second transitional phase the  requirements could be  tightened,
with government support being granted to  Democratic Banks, savings
banks and  cooperative banks alone, assuming they  operated strictly in
accordance with the following Common Good principles:
•no dividend payments;
•no interest on savings;
•Common Good assessments for all planned investments;
•limited eco-social venture capital;
•higher democratic standards.
To  initiate  the  transitional phase, an  EU-wide ethical banks’ association
could be set up whose members, as compensation for their Common Good
orientation, would have a  clearly reduced regulatory burden. After all,
ethics should pay off.
## THE CENTRAL BANK AND GLOBAL COOPERATION
The Central Bank would be organized in a new, transparent and democratic
way. As part of the democratic bank system it would be the property of the
sovereign people.  The steering committee would be  made up  of
representatives from all realms of society. The Central Bank would have a
monopoly on  money creation, putting limited amounts of  the  money it
created at the disposal of the state – limited, that is, in such a way as to keep
the  relation  between GDP and money supply more or  less  constant and
prevent any acceleration of inflation. The Democratic Central Bank would
finance the state via two channels:

•interest-free loans amounting to up to 50 percent of the GDP;
•unique gain from the conversion of private bank money into public
central bank money in the dimension of the money supply M1 (in the
UK: 78% of GDP in 2014);
•expansion of the money supply as a donation to the national budget (in
line with GDP growth).
Only the first point, elaborated in detail in the “sovereign-money reform”
## 8
## ,
would downsize the UK’s public debt from 89% of GDP (2014) to 11,2%
of GDP.
## 9
The rest could easily be converted into interest-free loans from the
Bank of England. This way the state would save the whole interest charge
for the national debt which amounts to 48 billion pounds in 2014/15 and
will continue to rise to up to 65 billion pounds by the end of the decade.
## 10
Together with the seignorage benefit after the positive money reform, this
conversion benefit would balance the budget of the UK!
## 11
The division for global cooperation in the democratic bank system would
grant inexpensive or  no-cost loans in  the  framework of  development
assistance. The costs for this would come from the general tax coffers or
through legally restricted money creation. The division for  global
cooperation would  assume the  default risk  for  venturesome exports that
created added social and ecological value, promoted sustainable
development and had passed an inspection verifying this. The means for
financing such projects would also come from general tax money.
## GLOBAL CURRENCY UNION AND GLOBO
The  Central Bank would participate in  a  global currency cooperation
following an  idea  initially developed by  John Maynard Keynes.
## 12
## The
crucial elements of such currency cooperation would be:
•The creation of a common unit of account for international trade, that is,
a global reserve or global trade currency (for example the globo or terra).
•This would be based on a large basket of currencies or commodities.
•National currencies would continue to exist. Exchange rates for the
global reserve or global trade currency would be fixed by a global

commission of the Central Banks and defended against any possible
residual speculation.
•In the event of changes in real economic fundamental data (inflation,
productivity, current account) the national currencies would be
appreciated or depreciated with respect to the global trade currency so as
to preserve economic parity (the “Greek tragedy” could have been
prevented by depreciation, and the imbalance between the USA and
China never would have developed).
•Whoever resisted appreciation/depreciation would be required to pay
penalty interest for deviations from an equal balance of trade, with the
amount increasing with the size and duration of the deviation.
•Cross-border payment transactions would be handled exclusively by
public clearing offices operated by the Central Banks. This would allow
effective prevention of tax evasion.
The Commission of Experts of the President of the UN General Assembly
on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System chaired by
Joseph Stiglitz supports the proposal put forward by Keynes as an “idea
whose time has come”.
## 13
## REGIONAL MONEY
The globo would be a “complementary currency” at the international level.
Complementary currencies could exist at the local level as well to promote
regional business cycles and to enhance the resilience of regions in times of
crisis. The  Democratic Banks could issue such regional complementary
currencies in  their function as  Regional Central Banks. The local
democratic sovereigns would decide whether the  regional currency in
question should become legal tender with – regionally restricted – duty of
acceptance.
## CONCLUSION
Through political determination of exchange rates, commodity prices and
interest rates (in the form of charges for credit) financial markets  would

cease to exist; the global financial casino would be closed, the formation of
bubbles would be  a  thing of  the  past. The  stock markets would be
transformed into regional Common Good institutions through which equity
from the  region would flow,  being channelled into  the  most  useful
enterprises. In this way, money would be forced back into its serving role. It
would become a  means for  meaningful economic development  and  the
common good. No  one  could become rich  through possession of  money
alone; income would be made by working and for this reason such earned
income would be enough to lead a good life.
## WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
At its activists’ assembly in April 2010, Attac Austria adopted a project
paper on the Democratic Bank.
## 14
It describes the idea of a comprehensive
public bank. Since one cannot expect this idea to be implemented in the
near future given the current form of democracy, Attac has called upon civil
society to found a private prototype which could become a model for the
foundation of  similar bank projects. The  Democratic Bank Project was
initiated in  June 2010, and  since October 2010, the  time of  the  actual
launch, some two hundred persons have participated in it.
Renamed as the Bank for the Common Good Project (Projekt Bank für
Gemeinwohl) the project has undergone a visionary process of its own, the
result of which does not align on all counts with the ideal proposed here.
This does not matter, however. What matters is that people who desire a
different kind  of  banking and  financial systemic take  action. Worldwide,
over 40 ethical banks have emerged and joined in the Global Alliance for
Banking on  Values (GABV). In  Austria, we  founded a  cooperative in
December 2014  which counts more than  5,000 members today.  It  has
established its own crowdfunding platform which, after approving a crowd-
based “common good evaluation”, finances sustainable projects in the range
from 5,000 to  250,000 euros successfully.  In  2019, the  cooperative
managed to offer the first “common good account” for individual customers
and companies in a joint venture with a local Raiffeisen bank. The next
project is the development of a “common good credit” for companies with a
common good balance sheet, the loan conditions depending on its result.

## FOUR
## PROPERTY
The  Economy for  the  Common  Good would on  the  one  hand be  a
completely ethical market economy and on the other a truly liberal one. The
latter would mean three things: (1)  all  human beings and  market
participants should enjoy the same liberties, rights and opportunities; (2) the
economic power  of  the  one  must be  limited where identical or  other
liberties of fellow human beings are at risk of being encroached upon; (3)
concerning property, which can be the foundation for liberty as well as for
power and domination, diversity would be key. There should be a mixture
of  private property,  public property,  social property,  communal property
(commons) and use rights. No form of property should be given absolute
precedence.
In the current economic order the absolute status of private property has
come to pose the greatest threat to democracy. Through non-restriction of
property rights some persons and enterprises have become so wealthy and
powerful that they dominate the media and guide political processes to their
own benefit. This contradicts the basic democratic principle of equal rights,
opportunities and possibilities of participation for all. It also goes against
the fundamental liberal principle that the freedom of the one ends where it
begins to encroach upon that of the other – and thus also upon equality.
Both principles imply that power in the state, in society and in business may
not be distributed too inequitably lest such power be abused. In recent years
numerous authors have addressed  this  issue, among them Robert Reich
(Supercapitalism), Gerhard Schick (Powereconomy), Lisa Herzog (Freedom
Does Not Only Belong to the Rich), Richard Wilkinson (The Spirit Level:
Why Equality is Better for Everyone) and, most recently, Thomas Piketty
(Capital in the Twenty-First Century). But even prominent proponents of
capitalism such as  the  OECD secretary-general Ángel Gurría  or  World

Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab are also pointing out the dangers
posed by the rise of economic inequality and are demanding restrictions.
## 1
## NEGATIVE FEEDBACK
The core idea behind the principle of the division of power is essentially
that  power  in  government must be  divided (for  example between the
legislative, the executive and the judiciary) so that none of these authorities
may become too  powerful. Today we  face the  urgent necessity of
transferring this principle to the economy because in this realm power is so
concentrated that  the  excessive (property-based) freedom of  the  one
endangers that of others. To achieve the necessary separation of powers I
propose “negative feedback mechanisms”. The term “negative feedback” is
a concept from systems theory which means that a tendency that prevails
within a  system –  for  example warming –  is  cancelled out  by  a  reverse
tendency – in this case cooling. If this were not the case the system would
overheat and  explode. Negative feedback keeps complex living systems
stable. “Positive feedback” means that tendencies reinforce each other. The
melting of the Arctic ice sheet, for example, can lead to darkening of the
land surface and thus to increased warming of the Earth, the result being
that  climate change will  accelerate. Capitalism is  a  system with  positive
feedback because a progressive increase in wealth and size makes it easier
and easier for individuals and enterprises to get richer and bigger. The first
million euros is  the  most  difficult one  to  obtain. Generating the  second
million is already a lot easier. Once a person has reached the 100 million
mark he or she probably does not even really know any more how the last
million was accomplished. Whoever has amassed one thousand millions has
to spend a daily average of 220,000 euros in order to keep from getting
even richer.
## 2
Negative feedback would mean that the first million would be
the  easiest  to  acquire and  thus  be  obtainable for  the  majority,  whereas
getting even richer and  bigger would be  increasingly difficult until it
became utterly impossible. The  following forms of  “negative feedback”
could achieve this:
•limitation of income inequity;
•caps on the right to acquire private property;

•limitations on the size of company assets in the form of private property;
•limitations on the right to inherit.
## LIMITATION OF INCOME INEQUITY
If  I  ask  the  highly diverse audiences at  my  lectures what the  maximum
difference is between how much two different people can get done in an
hour, I get very consistent responses; they typically say one person might be
able to achieve twice, five times or sometimes ten times as much as the
other.  If  someone suggests it  could be  twenty times as  much, there is
usually a  lot  of  headshaking. And when asked what the  maximum
difference between what two different people should be allowed to earn for
the same duration of effort should be, the response is usually a factor of
three, five,  seven, ten,  twelve or  twenty.  Some individuals suggest a
hundredfold or thousandfold difference, while others advocate a factor of
two or even one: the same pay for the same degree of exertion per time unit.
Today the  best-paid manager in  the USA, John Paulson, earns 350,000
times the statutory minimum wage, raking in an annual income of US$5
billion. In Germany, Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking made 6,666 times
the  minimum monthly pay  (hypothetically defined as  1,000 euros). Now
most studies which address this  topic come to  the  conclusion that  such
extreme differences:
•promote neither performance nor responsibility;
•do not make the rich happy but instead greedy;
•make the poor feel inferior (in every sense);
•foster discomfort, stress, illnesses and mortality;
•lead to a rise in mistrust, aggression and crime.
## 3
Beyond a certain threshold, inequity does not benefit society any more at
all; instead it begins to be a detriment. As pleasant as doubling the outside
temperature from 13 to 26 degrees Celsius might be, the warmth becomes
quite unpleasant if  it  rises to  39  degrees, and  every additional  degree
aggravates the discomfort even more. Warmth is not a goal in itself, but
merely a pleasant condition if the optimum (of well-being, quality of life)

has been reached. In the case of economic inequity there is no “natural”
optimum, but human beings have an intuitive sense of justice and it is only
logical that their sense of justice is offended if someone gets 350,000 or
even “only” 6,000 times the pay that someone else gets for doing the same
amount of work. According to a survey conducted by the Financial Times
and the Harris polling firm, 78 percent of respondents in the USA were of
the opinion that inequity had increased too much. In the UK, 79 percent
thought so; in China, 80 percent were of this opinion, and in Germany 87
percent held this view.
## 4
These responses are presumably distributed among
voters of  all  large  parties. Another survey revealed that  81  percent of
Germany’s conservative Christian Democrats (the CDU) think managers’
salaries are too high.
## 5
The  proposal of  the  Economy for  the  Common Good is  to  have a
democratically organized economic convention work out several possible
limits for  income inequity,  for  example a  seven-, ten-,  twelve-, twenty-,
thirty-, hundred- and thousand-fold multiple, letting the population vote on
the  issue  using the  systemic consensus principle.
## 6
If  the  most ambitious
wanted to  earn  more, this  would be  possible; the  only  thing  is  that  the
minimum wage  would have to  increase as  well. The  rich  and  the  poor
would be fatefully intertwined. An important addition is that the minimum
wage would have to guarantee conditions of life fit for human beings. It
could be  attached to  a  “good-life  basket” with  the  standard net  income
being somewhere in the vicinity of 1,250 euros in Central Europe, $1,500 in
the USA, or £1,000 in the UK.
Since no capital income would exist in the Economy for the Common
Good, the problem of adding together earned and capital income would be
eliminated. Rent income would be added on to personal income and the
total would be limited, for example, to ten or twenty times the minimum
wage. Theoretically enterprises could pay  their employees more, but  the
maximum tax rate would reach 100 percent from a certain democratically
fixed multiple of  the  minimum  wage upwards. Hiding income or  assets
from the tax authorities would no longer be possible since the (common-
good-oriented) banks would automatically report all  income to  them.
International capital transactions would be  overseen by  the  Democratic
Central Bank. This way the only possibility remaining would be to have
millions paid out in cash and stuffed inside a pillow. But then the money

would be missing on the balance sheet, and the pillow would soon become
so big it would fill up an entire room.
## RESTRICTION OF PRIVATE ASSETS
Have you ever tried to spend a billion dollars? You would need a large staff
of  helpers to  master this  enormous task. You  would have to  devote an
increasingly large part of your day to “managing” your assets, becoming, in
a sense, an employee of your own fortune. Those who possess too much
become obsessed. Happiness research has shown that material wealth only
increases life satisfaction up to a relatively low level, beyond which life
satisfaction is enhanced by other values. But this is not the main problem
(because a  free  society should never take  away anyone’s  right to  self-
inflicted unhappiness). The  main issue is  that  persons who  accumulate
billions and  billions amass enormous power and  thus have immense
leverage when it  comes to  influencing society (and thus  impairing the
happiness and freedom of others). What billions are capable of doing can be
illustrated by looking at Silvio Berlusconi (the media oligopoly), George W.
Bush (with his oil empire) or Frank Stronach (who bought a political party
in  Austria). If  individuals are  granted unlimited right of  ownership the
freedom of the majority will suffer – or even be eliminated altogether –
because in a society with extreme inequity mistrust, fear, violence, crime
and  corruption increase. The  epidemiologists Kate Pickett and  Richard
Wilkinson have  collected a  plethora of  studies on  this  topic. One  of  the
conclusions they draw is:
if the United States was to reduce its income inequality to something
like the average of the four most equal of the rich countries (Japan,
Norway,  Sweden and  Finland), the  proportion of  the  population
feeling they could trust others might rise by 75 percent – presumably
with matching improvements in the quality of community life; rates
of mental illness and obesity might similarly each be cut by almost
two-thirds, teenage birth rates could be  more than  halved, prison
populations might be reduced by 75 percent, and people could live
longer while working the equivalent of two months less per year.
## 7

For  this  reason an  upper limit for  private property would have to  be
discussed in the Economy for the Common Good, for example ten million
euros (once again, the  economic  convention would have to  decide). Ten
million euros is still so much that anyone who possessed that amount would
be able to afford almost any luxury and yet that sum is not enough to buy a
government or to shape society according to one’s own will. In other words,
property rights would be quite liberal!
## DEMOCRATIZATION OF CORPORATIONS
A deeply rooted reflex reaction many people have when someone criticizes
the  power  of  private property is  to  reproach that  person for  allegedly
wanting to get rid of it. But that is just as illogical as it would be to suggest
that someone who advocates longer lunch breaks wanted to eliminate work
altogether or that mobility researchers who espoused speed limits had an
aversion to motion.
Entrepreneurs such  as  carpenters, craftsmen, innkeepers, software
programmers, architects and florists all have private property but they do
not endanger the freedom of others because they do not possess the political
power necessary to do so. For this reason such small enterprises should be
allowed to keep all of their private property in the future as well (even if
they are rewarded for conduct which promotes the common good). Small
and medium-sized enterprises constitute the  large  majority of  all
enterprises. In  Austria, 99.6  percent of  companies have fewer than  500
employees. Multinational corporations are quite another matter, however.
Today global groups exist that are more powerful than many governments.
Their decisions have the potential to affect hundreds of thousands of people
and they exert a disproportionate influence on the media, political parties,
science and justice. The fact that a few private individuals determine the
course taken by such giants while all those affected – inside corporations
and  beyond them –  are  given no  say is  profoundly undemocratic. This
situation is irreconcilable with the highest good in Western culture, namely
democracy. For this reason, large corporations should be democratized to
ever higher degrees in proportion to their growth in size, and the degree of
co-determination granted to society should be increased accordingly. Take
this possible scenario, for example:

•in enterprises with over 250 employees the workforce and society get 25
percent of the voting power;
•in enterprises with over 500 employees they receive 50 percent of the
voting power;
•in enterprises with over 1,000 employees they have two-thirds of the
voting power;
•in enterprises with over 5,000 employees the voting power is distributed
evenly among the owners, the employees, the customers, the gender
equality officers and the environmental ombudspersons.
In  some countries, such as  Germany,  employee co-determination already
exists in  large  corporations; the  largest  challenge is  still  to  achieve co-
determination of society, although this already exists as well: the State of
Lower Saxony in  Germany holds a  20  percent blocking minority in
Volkswagen, and this is certainly not to the detriment of the company. But
state property managed by  governments is  a  source of  unease for  many
people, and  rightly so.  Depending on  the  government in  office, such
enterprises could be guided in various different directions and in the worst
case misused.
Thus it would be better if society had a body independent of government
which helped steer the enterprises. One could conceivably have a regional
economic parliament which would act as a representative of the sovereign
people and be on the supervisory board of all large companies in the region.
This parliament would be  elected by  means of  a  direct democratic
procedure. The “democratic supervisory boards” would have to be highly
qualified in terms of business management, ethics and as Common Good
customers. They would have to draw up regular reports, elucidating how
they exercised their right to vote for the benefit of all. This would create an
economic–political public which would concern itself not  with the
development of stock prices but rather with the satisfaction of needs and the
purposeful allocation of investments.
If  the  public and  the  employees were to  take  more responsibility  the
larger a company became, it would only be fair for them to help bear the
brunt of any financial losses. Freedom and responsibility should be coupled.
During the bank and economic crisis of 2008 the situation was such that
private owners made the decisions and the general public bore the losses.
This is just as unfair as the reverse would be. For this reason the public

sector should adopt financial responsibility as well, to the degree that it has
a  say  in  decision-making processes. If  it  had  no  desire to  take  such
responsibility for any given company, it could reduce the company’s size
again, thus “fully privatizing” it. Private owners would be at liberty to do
the same. If they wanted to make all the decisions themselves they would
have to  keep the  company correspondingly small. In  Austria only one
enterprise in  a  thousand has  more  than  500  employees. If  the  proposed
threshold values were applied, 999  out  of  1,000 enterprises would have
majority private control and majority private property.
## EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION
For as many people as possible, the long-term goal of the Economy for the
Common Good would be for them to become co-owners of the enterprise
they work in and to take mutual responsibility in guiding its operation and
bearing the  risk  of  loss. Democracy means not  merely having  a  say  in
matters but also bearing mutual responsibility and risk. For this reason even
small companies should be rewarded for doing this – but not be obligated to
do so – if they allow those employees who desire to do so to participate in
the  company and  bear the  corresponding responsibility and  risk. An
argument often raised is  that  not  everyone would want to  do  this;  but
everyone would not have to. No one could claim, however, that there are no
employees who would like to be part-owners of a company and also take
financial responsibility! Those who did could be offered the opportunity to
do  so  by  the  transfer of  1  or  a  few  percent per  year  of  the  company’s
property to an employee fund, for example, which the employees, as full-
fledged owners, would have a say in. If enterprises did this, they would get
bonus points on their Common Good Balance Sheet.
## RETAINING PROFITS IN COMPANIES
According to current law, owners of an enterprise can appropriate the entire
profit earned by all its employees. Those who support this legal situation
justify it  by  citing  the  right to  property and  by  arguing that  the  owner
brought capital into the company (initially) and took the concomitant risk of
capital loss.  His  or  her  legal responsibility and  liability are  also  cited.

Indeed, the  owner of  a  company often does work more for  it  than  the
employees do, but sometimes also the owner does less.
As  a  company increases in  size,  nevertheless, the  contribution  which
non-founders make to the profit it earns increases as well; no one would
contest this fact. For this reason the profit should not go exclusively to the
founder indefinitely, particularly since in the long run this person is only
responsible for a (shrinking) part of its success; the degree to which the
owner should be entitled to the profit should indeed decrease to the degree
that the efforts of others are responsible for the success of the company. The
following scenario would be conceivable: for companies
•with more than ten employees the proportion of profit the founder could
appropriate or pay out in dividends would decrease by 1 percent each
year;
- with more than twenty employees the proportion would decrease by 2
percent;
•with more than thirty employees the proportion would decrease by 3
percent;
•with more than fifty employees the proportion would decrease by 4
percent;
•with more than one hundred employees it would decrease by 5 percent.
In other words the founder of a company with over one hundred employees
would no longer have access to any of the profits after twenty years. An
important distinction must be made here: we are talking about the balance
sheet profit and  not  the  entrepreneur’s  income! As  before, founders of
companies could be paid a salary which exceeded the statutory minimum
wage by a multiple of ten or twenty, for example. The idea put forth here
would have no effect on most small enterprises. The objective would be to
protect large  companies from excessive profits being skimmed off,
especially by inheritors who had not built up the enterprise but now owned
it  and  appropriated part  of  its  profit whether they  worked or  not.  Today
many family-owned businesses already refrain from distributing  profits
(paying out  dividends) and  they  do  it  out  of  principle. They voluntarily
practise the highest level of conduct proposed here because they already
embrace the  notions that  (a)  profits should stay  in  the  company and  (b)

everyone who works should receive remuneration for doing so, including
the owners of enterprises.
On  the  other hand many people found companies with  the  motive of
providing for  their  old  age.  For  this  reason an  exception to  the  rule  “no
capital income” could conceivably be made. Founders of enterprises could
be allowed to derive a (limited) pension from the earnings of the company
founded and  built up  by  them over  many years. For  example one  could
decide that  anyone who  built up  a  company for  twenty-five years could
receive a  “company founder pension” for  an  equal period of  time. This
would be in addition to the statutory pension, which would already suffice
to live out one’s life in dignity along with the savings that had accrued in
the course of building up the company. The amount of the supplementary
company founder’s pension would be adjusted to the amount of money the
founder had taken out of the company while building up the enterprise. This
is the core idea: whoever scrimped and saved to establish a company should
receive a  higher company founder’s  pension than someone who
remunerated himself generously for his own efforts from the very start, was
able to put quite a bit of money aside for this reason and was thus already
well provided for in old age.
## RESTRICTION OF THE RIGHT TO INHERIT,
## GENERATIONS FUND AND “DEMOCRATIC DOWRY”
Inheritance tax also serves the purpose of preventing the accumulation of huge assets in the
hands of a few.
Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria, Germany, paragraph 123
An unlimited right to inherit annuls the only “natural” negative feedback
mechanism of capitalism, namely that by which accrued and concentrated
assets get deconcentrated and redistributed. Thus it perhaps poses the single
largest impediment on our way to a democratic, liberal society pledged to
providing equal opportunities for all.
The  effect  of  an  unlimited right to  inherit is  that  some of  us  enter
working life  with  a  starting capital  of  several billion euros while others
begin with nothing (and, in some circumstances, with emotional trauma and
a lack of self-esteem). In the USA and the UK, the fact that many students
are obliged to take out loans to pay for their studies means that many young

people begin work having already amassed a huge debt. According to the
Institute for Fiscal Studies, the average British student debt will be £44,015
at the end of his or her studies. An incredible 73 percent will be unable to
pay back this debt in their lifetime.
## 8
In Germany, at the beginning of the
millennium, only 15  percent of  the  adult population received an
inheritance.
## 9
Thus 85 percent did not benefit from the right to inherit. Since
high  concentrations  of  property constitute a  power factor,  the  economic
injustice is  combined with a  political injustice. Just compare the
possibilities for  political participation that  are  open to  the  offspring of
welfare recipients with those offered to the heirs of ABF, Stemcor, Porsche
or BMW owners and CEOs. Who will be more successful in life? Studies
on the elite show that the managers of tomorrow are not necessarily the
most talented and intelligent people, but rather the sons and daughters of
today’s managers. Some 80 percent of the managers working in the hundred
largest  corporations  in  Germany come from the  richest 3  percent of  the
population. In 2003 only one CEO of the 30 DAX-listed companies had a
working-class background. For this reason Michael Hartmann, a researcher
who studies the elite, writes: “Managers are already born as such.”
## 10
Would it not be fairer and promote performance more if everyone were
to start out under the same conditions? Regarding the right to inherit, sober
consideration elicits two extreme positions:
1.The feudal position. Birth alone decides who inherits what and how
much. Talent, performance and equal opportunity do not count. This is
the basis for the current – unrestricted – right to inherit in Germany and
## Austria.
2.The liberal position. All start out under the same conditions, and
performance alone decides who will acquire greater assets and who will
not. This position presupposes either complete abolition of the right to
inherit or equal distribution of inherited property to all.
The Economy for the Common Good would avoid such extremes. It would
neither embrace the feudal principle to an unrestricted degree nor would it
abolish the right to inherit completely. The solution would lie somewhere in
the middle; the right to inherit would be applicable up to a democratically
fixed maximum sum, with  assets exceeding that  sum  going to  a  public

Generations Fund  and  being distributed to  all  members of  the  next
generation in equal parts in the form of a “democratic dowry”.
## 11
The limit
for financial and property assets could lie at 500,000 or 750,000 euros per
person, for example (the values to be discussed and decided upon by the
economic convention).
In Germany, inherited assets amount to an annual sum of 130 to 200
billion euros
## 12
– which are approximately one fiftieth of the total national
assets (11.3 trillion euros).
## 13
If this amount were to be evenly distributed to
all  those starting out  in  working life,  that  would amount to  as  much as
200,000 euros per person – not a bad starting capital!
Of course, the sum would be reduced if inheritances amounting to up to
500,000 or  750,000 euros were not distributed and thus not
“democraticized” either. The lower the threshold, the larger the amount to
be  distributed via  the  Generations Fund. This fund could transfer the
democratic dowry to  all  citizens at  the  age  of  entering professional life.
Those who did  not  inherit anything by  this  time would get  the  full
“democratic dowry” of,  for  example, 100,000 euros. Accordingly,  those
who inherited 15,000 euros would receive the democratic dowry minus the
inherited amount, as a form of “negative inheritance tax” (similar to a wage
bonus paid to reach the minimum wage level). For every year in which the
national assets increased, the average democratic dowry would increase too.
In  contrast,  if  an  unlimited right  to  inherit were preserved, the  starting
conditions and  thus the  power relations would become increasingly
unequal. There would soon be some people with trillion-dollar inheritances
and many have-nots.
## REAL ESTATE
The fact that a good half of personal wealth exists in the form of real estate
assets is  the  only  weighty argument for  preserving the  right to  inherit
private assets up to a certain limit. If it were not for this, one could abolish
the  right to  inherit altogether and  provide everyone with  an  equal
“democratic dowry” when they started out so as to achieve at least initially
equal financial opportunities. In the case of real estate property this would
not be advisable, however, since inhabited flats and houses would have to
be relinquished, which is not exactly humane. But an exemption of 500,000

euros would already almost solve the problem. According to the Austrian
National Bank, (a)  only  50  percent of  all  households own  a  real  estate
property and (b) only 5 percent of the population owns a house with a value
of over 450,000 euros.
## 14
In the UK, the exemption threshold for inheritance
tax lies at £325,000, which is a little less than 500,000 euros. For Austria, a
500,000 euros threshold would mean that only 5 percent of the population
would be affected by the limitation on the right to inherit. In this case a
property owner would have to decide whether to share the inherited house
(should it  have a  value exceeding  500,000 euros) with  another inheritor
(who would also be allowed to inherit a property worth 500,000 euros) –
hence a house with a value of 850,000 euros could be passed on to two
children, for example – or an owner who wanted to own such a huge house
singly would have to pay the amount which exceeded a value of 500,000
euros into the generations funds for the benefit of society in general. Today
this  actually happens quite often:  a  piece of  real  estate is  left  to  several
children in equal parts but is taken over by one of these children, who then
pays out his or her siblings’ shares.
Of  course, the  sovereign people would be  free  to  define a  higher
exemption amount, for instance 750,000 or one million euros, to minimize
this issue.
## INHERITANCE OF ENTERPRISES
Now comes the  greatest challenge: inheritance of  enterprises. Today all
enterprises, even global corporations of unlimited size, can be bequeathed
to  children completely tax-free in  most European countries. Education,
talent, performance  and  social responsibility play  no  role  here. This is
extreme.
And this is why, already in 1924, Winston Churchill called inheritance
tax “a certain corrective against the development of a race of idle rich”.
## 15
## In
subsequent decades, inheritance taxes reached historical ceilings near to 80
percent in  the  UK  and  the  USA, whereas by  today the  top  rates have
dropped back to only 40 percent.
## 16
This fact has evoked responses from
such prominent critics as the US billionaire Warren Buffett, who compared
poorly restricted inheritance with  “choosing the  2020 Olympic team by
picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the 2000 Olympics”.
## 17

Inheritance law currently works in exactly this way. The consequence of an
almost unlimited  right to  inherit is  that  most enterprises built  up  by
entrepreneurs today will be  run  tomorrow by  persons whose only
“qualification” is that they are the son or daughter of the previous owner.
The latter need not even be the founder of the enterprise; he or she might
have merely inherited or bought it. This phenomenon has little to do with an
achievement-oriented society in which everyone should be able to develop
assets through his or her own efforts and his or her own contribution, and it
has just as little to do with a democratic society in which everyone should
have the  same opportunities to  participate and  find  the  same social
protection in  business. In  the  Economy for  the  Common Good  the  goal
would be to ensure that enterprises‘ assets are held by as many people as
possible in order that as many as possible can help carry responsibility. For
this reason democratic entrepreneurial structures would be promoted, and
one can presume that the proportion of cooperatives and similar legal forms
of business would rise. In such cases the issue of inheritance would not be
raised at all since cooperative shares are usually very small.
Privately held companies would  not  pose a  problem either because
shares would be  viewed as  financial assets. If  such shares exceeded the
limit for inheritance of private assets they would flow into the generations
fund. Another special case would be privately held companies founded by a
person’s own parents.
Thus the  only really tricky thing would be  family enterprises.  As  a
compromise between a  liberal position (equal opportunities for  all)  and
(quasi-feudal) family-oriented tradition, inheritance law could be designed
here in such a way that family members would be allowed to inherit shares
in the company amounting to a maximum of five, ten or twenty million
euros (start values). Any shares exceeding this amount could:
1.become the collective property of the employees who bore
responsibility for the enterprise and helped develop it (unlike some
owners); for this solution Common Good points would be awarded;
2.go to selected non-family-members who were willing to bear
responsibility for the enterprise. In this case the share would once again
be limited to 500,000 or 750,000 euros and would count as a
“democratic dowry”;

3.flow into the generations fund, being distributed in the form of
“democratic dowries” to individuals who wanted to work in the
company and would own a small part of it, bearing of course a part of
the risk.
4.For agricultural assets a special regulation could be found, which will
be discussed later (see “Ownership of nature”, page 103).
A  family business that  was  run  by  five  family members could thus  be
inherited by  the  offspring up  to  a  value of  50  million euros “tax-free”.
Despite such a  compromise this  proposal continues to  elicit strong
emotional reactions. The  counter-argument often raised is  that  parents
would have no incentive to build up an enterprise if they could not pass it
on to their children in its entirety. Were this to be the case, it would also be
proof that human beings do not act out of purely egoistic intentions, as is
often imputed, but rather exert themselves for the benefit of others – their
children. According to  this  logic, childless individuals would have no
incentive to do anything at all. This is diametrically opposed to the ideology
of the market economy which has prevailed for the past two hundred years,
the claim being that everyone strives for his own benefit and advantage and
that  this  is  what  we  hope to  derive maximum motivation and  system
efficiency from.
We  all  know there  are  entrepreneurs who  have no  children or  whose
children do not want to take over the business. It is not uncommon for the
question of  succession to  divide the  minds of  entire (sometimes quite
extended) families. In such cases the enterprise could be transferred to those
who work in it and wish to take responsibility for it together with debts
owed by  the  company as  well. Should there be  children, they  would be
entitled to the full “democratic dowry” if they decided not to accept the
inheritance. Speculative buy-ups and immediate resale of estates (to private
persons) could be prohibited by stipulating that an individual would only be
allowed to inherit a share in the company if he or she had actually worked
in the business for at least three years. Enterprises are not toys; they should
be controlled by those who are willing to adopt personal responsibility and
create added value through their own exertions.
What is the objective of these proposals? Fairer distribution of company
property, democratization of enterprises and thus ultimately the replacement
of capitalistic conditions by more democratic and more liberal structures.

For in total, the freedom of the individual would not be limited by these
proposals but rather increased. The “loss of freedom” of the heir who is not
allowed to inherit Mama’s and/or Papa‘s large corporation alone and run it
irrespective of his or her qualifications to do so would be countered by the
gain in freedom on the part of countless people who currently begin their
working life today with no inheritance or means at all (even if their parents
helped build up an enterprise through decades of work).
Today such  people might even find  work in  a  company inherited by
people who have done nothing to contribute to its development but who
now own it and proceed to appropriate the added value generated by the
work of others who have inherited nothing and must work for them as a
result. In other words, we have a case of structural slavery. Today the only
alternative non-inheritors have to selling their own labour power is to set up
a successful company themselves. Not everyone is in a position to do so,
however – for diverse reasons and often through no fault of their own. And
in capitalism the top dogs do not make it easy for newcomers. Thus many
are forced to work for others and to hand over to them the added value
produced by their own work. This makes capitalism a systemically unfree
and  exploitative  structure. The  objection one  could raise, namely that
everyone has the possibility of becoming an entrepreneur and that for this
reason those who do not take advantage of this option should be willing to
work for others, is out of touch with reality because some people simply do
not fulfil the prerequisites for founding a business. Equal opportunities do
not exist because human beings differ in terms of their health, their talents,
their education and their assets. These many forms of inequality are no fault
of their own.
Arguing that “everyone could if they only wanted to” is not even logical
because if everyone were to take an entrepreneurial risk upon themselves,
which is always claimed to be a matter of free volition, there would be no
“dependent workers” any more. Then no one could hire even one employee
or apprentice; division of labour in the market economy would not work
any  more. Thus the  contribution that  “dependent workers” make to  the
economic product is just as indispensable as is that of the employers and for
this  reason  it  should be  esteemed in  equal measure and  remunerated
similarly or – ideally – organized in a better way. This would entail co-
participation and  co-ownership for  all  who  want it  instead of  having a
minority decide  everything and  being allowed to  appropriate the  added

value generated by others on the basis of the wholesale justification – apt or
erroneous –  that  they  contribute more, take  more risks, and  carry more
responsibility. In systemic terms it would be more logical and fairer if:
1.decisions were made by all employees and investors mutually;
2.earnings were distributed among all employees/value-adding
protagonists;
3.as many as possible had a share in the property, and
4.as a result helped bear the entrepreneurial risk and responsibility.
An automatic retort made in reaction to those proposing more democracy in
enterprises is:  “But many employees do  not  even want to  take any
responsibility!” and:  “Not everyone is  able  to  run  a  business!” But  they
would not  have to.  They would only have equal rights in  regard to
determining who  should run  the  enterprise. Running a  typical small
business with  five  employees on  a  direct democratic basis would  be  no
problem. In cases of large enterprises with, say, three hundred employees
there would certainly be some who “only” wanted to do their work. And
why should they not be allowed to do this? But they should have a say in
who should make the decisions in the enterprise. Then it would be run by
people and not by capital.
Coming back to the issue of family businesses, if they were passed on
not  exclusively to  owners’ sons  and  daughters but  rather to  a  group of
democratic owners, that  would  hardly mean that  the  sons  and  daughters
would have  no  chance to  (help)  run  the  business. They would simply
possess no automatic, dynastic entitlement – like succession to a throne;
instead the children would have to prove themselves deserving of such a
responsible position by applying for it and convincing the workforce that
they were the candidates most suitable for the tasks of management. This
means that  in  the  Economy for  the  Common Good sons  and  daughters
could take  over  and  run  quite large  family enterprises founded  by  their
parents or grandparents – but only if they were the people best suited to do
this. Remember what Warren Buffett said. If others were better, the right to
inherit would no longer automatically equate entitlement with ownership
and  management. Realizing this  and  acting accordingly would constitute

taking a long overdue step out of the feudal ages – a step not yet taken
because of intensive ideological indoctrination.
The proposed measures would create two kinds of negative feedback in
regard to one of the central problems of our time: unequal distribution of
capital and  the  excessive economic and  political power  of  global
corporations and individuals which accompanies it. This twofold negative
feedback would be  achieved through in-company democratization and
progressive communalization of enterprises as they grew in size. The result
would be a more democratic and freer economy. More people would have a
say, the opinions and competencies of more people would be sought, and
the  value of  more human beings would be  appreciated to  a  degree not
previously reached – not only in the form of a commendatory pat on the
back but through material property and co-determination rights.
Almost everything said  here  has  already been thought and  written by
many others, for instance the famous John Stuart Mill, whose Principles of
Political Economy was the leading textbook in economics in the second half
of the nineteenth century:
The  inequalities of  property which arise from unequal industry,
frugality,  perseverance, talents, and  to  a  certain extent even
opportunities, are inseparable from the principle of private property,
and if we accept the principle, we must bear with these consequences
of it: but I see nothing objectionable in fixing a limit to what any one
may acquire by the mere favour of others, without any exercise of his
faculties, and in requiring that if he desires any further accession of
fortune, he shall work for it.
## 18
## ENDOWMENTS
Some people might object that  the  proposed limitations on  rights of
inheritance could  be  easily circumvented, for  example by  mothers and
fathers giving multi-millions to their offspring during their own lifetime.
Such efforts to  get  around laws could be  easily prevented, however,  by
introducing an  endowment exemption equal in  sum  to  the  inheritance
exemption. Parents could opt  to  give  their children 500,000 or  750,000
euros, for  example. But  such endowments would be  deducted from the

inheritance, as is partly foreseen in the British Inheritance Tax Act. Some
might argue that parents could still hire their own children and pay them
exorbitant salaries for  their work. This type of  circumvention seems
improbable to  me,  however,  because it  would come up  against various
hindrances and limits, for example:
1.earnings being allowed to be no more than 10 or 20 times the statutory
minimum wage;
2.a 10 million euro limit on private property;
3.parents would have to push through extremely high salaries against the
possible resistance of others with a say, and this would become harder
and more unlikely to succeed the farther along democratization had
progressed;
4.shares in enterprises would not necessarily be paid in the form of a
“cash” salary. Parts of the company would have to be sold, which would
increase the probability that it would be democratized.
Of course in introducing a new social and economic order we should give
some thought to how efforts to get around this order should be penalized.
But  nothing provides such strong  proof of  our  capacity to  do  this  as  do
property rights. Whoever wants  to  “get  around” today’s  protection of
private property must reckon with severe prosecution, punishment and
imprisonment. Consequently the Economy for the Common Good would
not  have more  property regulations and  laws but  rather different  ones:
minimum participation on  the  part of  all  would be  protected as
systematically as unlimited private property is for only a few today.
## “DEMOCRATIC COMMONS”
In  addition to  a  majority of  small  private enterprises and  a  minority of
corporations with mixed ownership there should be at least a third category
of property – namely private and public common property. I will talk about
classical private commons later and start with public property. But not in
the  customary form. In  Europe  after World  War  Two,  roads,  railways,
power supply mains, drinking water and gas utilities, schools, universities,
hospitals, post offices and telephone lines were established and operated by

the state. These were referred to as “public services”. Since the 1980s this
public sector has been liberalized and privatized to ever-increasing degrees.
This process  has  perhaps reached its  nadir now; bad  experiences and
protests have begun to turn things around.
## 19
My proposal is not to return to
the kind of state-run utility companies we had in the past but rather to have
essential branches of  industry be  controlled directly by  the  population. I
have introduced the concept “modern commons” into discussions on this
idea.
## 20
Traditionally speaking, “commons” are a common good that belongs to
everyone. During the Middle Ages these were typically an expanse of forest
or meadow which could be used by all inhabitants of the village. Using this
historic fact as a source of inspiration, “modern” or “democratic” commons
could be  railways  and  the  postal  services, universities, utility  companies
and kindergartens or even banks. Sovereign proprietors would take charge
of  these businesses, running them themselves. International examples of
success in this area show how this could work. In Sacramento, the capital of
the state of California, a power supply company called SMUD provides 1.5
million people with electricity. The executive board of this energy supplier
is elected on the basis of direct democracy. For this reason the enterprise
must orient  itself to  the  priorities of  the  population, which  it  does
excellently. In terms of environmental protection and high-quality service,
SMUD is highly preferred by the population, constantly ranking at the top
nationwide and  performing way  above statutory minimum standards in
California. The  owners get  to  decide on  the  most important issues
themselves. So  far  this  in-company form of  direct democracy has  been
applied once: in  1989 SMUD asked its  citizen owners whether the
company’s  only nuclear power plant, Rancho Seco Nuclear Power
Generating Station, should continue to operate – with lower fees, but the
risk of a nuclear accident – or if instead a new path should be taken in the
direction of  alternative energies, what would increase user fees. The
majority of the service’s consumers decided in favour of decommissioning
the  plant and  making massive efforts to  promote green energy  sources.
Looking at California’s environmental record today, we can clearly see the
success of this “sovereign” decision.
The Swiss population landed a similar success for the environment via
direct democracy. In the 1980s the government wanted to make ruinous cuts
in  the  operations of  the  state-run railway system and  to  privatize it  in  a

fashion similar to Germany or the UK. But in Switzerland the sovereign
people vetoed this  plan. Through a  referendum demanded by  the
population, the billions earmarked for road construction were reallocated
for expansion of the railway system. The result is that Switzerland now has
the best and most popular railways in the world.
A  third  example: in  the  Brazilian metropolis of  Porto Alegre the
communal budget is  drawn up  with participation of  the  population
(“participatory budget”) and  the  municipal drinking water supply is
organized via  a  “public popular  partnership”, or  PPP.  The  municipal
administration and the population work together in this alternative PPP. The
result is  just  about  as  sensational as  the  one  achieved in  California: 99
percent of the population is connected to the drinking water network and
the  rate  of  sewage connection has  now  reached 70  percent. Because the
wealthy people who water their golf courses and fill their swimming pools
have to  pay  highly progressive rates, the  poor are  provided with
inexpensive drinking water and the public-owned enterprise gets by without
any subsidies from the municipal budget, which is to say, without a single
cent of taxpayers’ money.
With regard to the organization of the “democratic commons”, I envision
a  directly elected executive board made up  of  representatives of  public
authorities (the government), employees and consumers as well as gender
equality officers  and  environmental ombudspeople. “Classic state-owned
enterprises” that are controlled by the government or the mayor should not
exist in the Economy for the Common Good. A public services convention
could define those areas of  business which should belong to  the  public
Common Good sector along with the rules for organizing it.
“Classical” commons are privately organized, and range from pastures
and fishing grounds to seed farms and software. The Commons Strategy
Group around David Bollier and Silke Helfrich have done extensive work
on this.
## 21
The first female “Nobel laureate” in economics, Elinor Ostrom,
has also written on the rules that must be respected if commons are to work
well and not end in “tragedy”, as predicted by classic economics.
## 22
## OWNERSHIP OF NATURE

Humankind did not create nature – neither the flora nor the fauna. Human
beings can  use  nature but  if  they  are  not  careful, they  will  destroy the
foundation of their own existence and themselves. We are guests on this
Earth who  are  merely tolerated on  a  certain condition, namely that  we
possess ecological  empathy.  Respect for  nature could be  expressed by
agreeing that no individual should own any part of nature, particularly not
any land.
## 23
But those who require land for concrete aims or for purposes of
cultivation should be allowed to use a limited amount of it at no charge.
Especially among farmers who have become accustomed to “owning” a bit
of  land  this  mindset might make them feel  unappreciated in  their fruit-
bearing labour. But they would still “possess” some land; it is just that its
ownership would  be returned to  nature. Nothing would change for
agriculturalists in  terms of  their tasks and  practices. In  fact  everything
would become cheaper because land tax would be eliminated. This would
be an expression of the community’s appreciation of their valuable labour.
In return the amount of land allocated to each person as productive land
would be limited. In concrete terms the situation could be this:
1.Municipalities would regulate allocation of productive land.
2.Every individual would be entitled to a living area up to a certain limit,
for example a maximum of 10,000 square metres. Use of such an area
could be acquired for a certain fixed square-metre price. These areas
could be exchanged for other areas of a similar size but only for the
purpose of living on them.
3.Agricultural businesses would be allotted a certain amount of land free
of charge on condition that they cultivated it with care. Here the
Common Good Balance Sheet could influence the size of the land
furnished for productive use, for example. This would constitute an
additional regulatory mechanism of the Common Good Balance Sheet.
4.Enterprises from all sectors – similar to private persons – could acquire
land needed to set up offices and production sites for a utilization fee. In
return, land tax could be eliminated.
The effect of these measures would be that:

1.appreciation for nature would be promoted. Ecuador was the first
country in the world to attribute an intrinsic value to nature, the Pacha
Mama, in its constitution of 2008.
## 24
Something which has an “intrinsic
value” cannot be the “property” of others;
2.the extremely inequitable distribution of real estate property would be
reduced;
3.intestacy rules regarding farmsteads would be simpler because there
would be no more owned land but only allocation linked to cultivation,
and landholdings would not have to be divided up among heirs. Tax on
landed property would also be eliminated;
4.real estate speculation and land grabbing, two logical consequences of
illiberal capitalism, would become a thing of the past.
## LIBERTY AND EQUALITY
In pseudoliberal capitalism the right to property is viewed as one of the
supreme liberties which should, as such, be invested with absolute status.
Yet  equality in  the  sense of  all  human beings having the  same  rights,
opportunities and liberties – has a higher value than freedom because too
much freedom for the one can endanger the freedom of others. If I drive too
fast (“freedom of movement”), insult others (“freedom of opinion”), injure
someone (“freedom to rampage”), or buy a million hectares of land, I limit
the  freedom of  others –  to  the  point of  endangering their lives. Thus
equality is an absolute principle and freedom a relative one. Restriction of
freedom is  a  principle but  restriction of  equality is  not.  In  respect to
property this means that all human beings should be equally entitled to a
limited amount of property (enough to lead a good life) but no one should
have unlimited right to property. Once the most extreme form of inequitable
distribution were  reached, that  is,  if  one  person were to  own  the  entire
world and  there was  nothing left  for  all  the  others, even the  last  sceptic
would probably agree with this train of thought. Freedom is important, but
what is even more important is that everyone has an equal right to it.

## FIVE
## MOTIVATION AND MEANING
## MOTIVATION
One of the most frequent worries people have the first time they hear about
the Economy for the Common Good is that motivation would slacken in
business if enterprises did not pursue boundless financial gain, people did
not  primarily strive for  their own benefit, and competition were
“eliminated”: after all,  where else should performance incentives,
innovation and prosperity come from?
These fears stem from the capitalistic, that is, social Darwinist image of
humankind according to which human beings are primarily motivated by
egoism and competition: if there is no competition to fear people only work
half as hard or lie around doing nothing; they do not really know what to do
with their lives if they are unable to compare themselves to and compete
with others, if they are not driven by the fear of losing their status or by a
craving for prestige and superiority. Intrinsic motivation, childlike curiosity,
inspiration and spontaneous creativity hardly have any place in this image.
Before I address such apprehensions and show why they are scientifically
unsound –  even though each of  us  knows people who are  primarily
motivated by  egotism –  I  want to  start by  taking quite a  pragmatic
approach.
1.The most frequent and simplest motivation for participating in an
enterprise or founding one in an Economy for the Common Good is that
people need monetary income all the same. The necessity to earn money
is not eliminated altogether even though it is mitigated, especially since
people get four free years in addition to the “democratic dowry” and a

reduction of working hours. The solidarity income (see Chapter 2) is
enough to survive with dignity but not to lead a “good life”. Those who
want to lead a good life must do something for it but the framework in
which they go about achieving this will be completely different and
much more favourable with regard to finding and accepting gainful
employment than it is today because in the Economy for the Common
Good (a) people will have more of a say in things because the roles of
“entrepreneurs” and “employees” will become increasingly indistinct;
(b) people will find more meaning in gainful employment; (c) people
will be less stressed and overtaxed; and (d) enterprises will not compete
with (or against) each other and be forced to make higher profits than
the others, which will mean that they will not cut jobs to stay
competitive. In cases of structural unemployment the Economy for the
Common Good will be adapted in such a way as to reward companies
more if they hire additional people.
2.Incomes from private enterprises will still be allowed to amount to a
certain multiple of the statutory minimum wage; the exact amount will
be decided by the sovereign people. Thus for people who are very
interested in having money there will still be an incentive to accept
work or to open up a new business. Since the minimum wage will be
calculated in such a way as to allow persons to live in dignity – for
example with a net income of 1,250 euros per month in Central Europe,
$1,500 in the USA or £1,000 in the UK – anyone who desires to have a
lot of money has the possibility to earn ten or twenty times the amount
that is necessary to lead a good life. Since hereditary rights are limited
and possession of assets is no longer rewarded – only work is – it can be
ensured that income does in fact accrue through actual performance. To
obtain higher incomes it will really be necessary to do more. Owning
assets will no longer suffice.
3.Happiness research has shown that beyond a certain point high incomes
do not make people happier and thus cannot constitute any purposeful
motivation. According to international studies the threshold lies at an
annual income of US$20,000, which is hardly any more than the
assumed statutory minimum wage of 1,250 euros per month.
## 1
## The
highest threshold known to me is an annual income of US$290,000
## 2
## –
which is about twenty times the proposed minimum wage. Increases in
income that exceed this figure do not generate any verifiable increase in

happiness (or in performance: the 45 best-paid Toyota managers each
earned an average of 320,000 euros in 2009.
## 3
Would anyone claim that
Toyota vehicles would be better if the managers earned 3.2 million
euros? Or 3.2 billion for that matter?)
4.Not only happiness researchers but also sociopsychological and
neurobiological scientists have come to the conclusion that human
beings are more strongly motivated by factors other than money: among
other things through strivings for autonomy, identity and competence,
the desire to make a contribution, community and relationships.
•Autonomy. Human beings strive for freedom in the sense that they
want to be able to perceive and articulate their feelings, needs and
thoughts freely. No one wants to be restricted in their fundamental
human existence. “Money” is not essential to anyone because it does
not constitute any feeling, basic need or creative thought.
•Identity. All human beings are unique, and one possible meaning of
life consists of discovering one’s uniqueness and allowing it to
unfold. What counts is not being better than others but rather being
different. What counts is not being better at the same thing but rather
being unique in terms of what one has to offer.
•Competence. Recognizing, nurturing and developing dormant
abilities are a basic need. We should be facilitated to do so. This
works in cooperative structures just as well as in competitive ones.
•Making a contribution. Every human being has something to
contribute to the whole, and every human being wants to contribute
something. Community and plenitude arise from the contributions of
all.
•Community. Human beings are community-oriented. They would
rather die than be isolated from other human beings even if they had
food.
## 4
Our brains are programmed for social networks. Communities
fulfil further basic needs such as a feeling of security, safety, esteem,
approval and a listening ear.
•Relationships. “Meaningful relationships are the unconscious goal
behind all human endeavour,” Joachim Bauer writes.
## 5
This is the
conclusion that current neurobiological research has arrived at.

When giving talks I  assess such insights time  and  again by  asking my
audience to reflect for a moment and name the situation in which they have
felt  the  most happiness to  date. What people name are  moments of
connectedness and experiences of successful relationships on four levels:
1.a meaningful relationship with oneself;
2.meaningful relationships with other human beings;
3.a meaningful relationship with nature;
4.a meaningful relationship with the larger scheme of things.
The keywords most often cited – apart from intense experiences in nature
such as walks on the beach, sunsets, mountain peaks and garden work – are
“birth”, “friends”, “partnership” and “love”, namely fulfilling interpersonal
relationships. In business such experiences could also constitute goals to be
defined, valued and financially remunerated. We would not be very wise if
we  failed  to  apply the  scientifically verified “expertise” or  collective
experience of happiness and meaningful community in business as well. In
the Economy for the Common Good, letting meaningful interpersonal and
ecological relationships thrive would invest performance and  economic
success with a new meaning. In the end we would not only aim to reach a
goal that has a social purpose but we would also, as evidence shows, be
more highly motivated than we are by the current competitive structures
and the pursuit of personal benefit at the cost of others. Democratization of
enterprises will increase not only the motivation of all those involved but
also  their prosperity: “If  a  company is  transformed into  a  community
through a larger degree of co-determination then productivity will increase
as  well.”  This  is  the  assessment  made by  epidemiologist and  inequality
researcher Richard Wilkinson on the basis of numerous studies.
## 6
And he
confirms the experience of Ricardo Semler with Semco in Brazil.
## 7
The path may still be a long one. Today, owners of capital are still held
in high esteem because they are viewed as persons who are willing to take a
personal risk, create countless jobs and generate economic prosperity. What
would things look  like  in  an  Economy for  the  Common Good?  To  start
with, more and more people would have the possibility to found a company
because they could start out with a substantial amount of start-up capital.
They could immediately participate in  companies or  found new  ones

themselves. If several persons were to pool their “democratic dowry” they
would soon have a million euros to found a business. Since the founders
would not even need a bank loan, their entrepreneurial risk would decrease
significantly. The following proposed measures would also play a role:
•progressive employee share ownership;
•progressive immunization of profit against dividend payouts;
•obligatory employee participation in large enterprises.
Just  distribution of  capital and  votes leads to  a  more even distribution
across the population of the willingness to take risks. Then the community
is  less  dependent on  shimmering personalities who  are  stylized as  top
performers even though some of their assets were merely inherited rather
than earned, or were acquired through positive feedback effects at the cost
of  others. In  almost all  cases they  also  rely  on  the  invisible relationship
work of  women whose essential, life-preserving and  happiness-giving
accomplishments are  hardly recognized, valued or  rewarded. Slowly but
surely relieving entrepreneurs –  primarily men –  of  their “sole
responsibility” for  a  company would mean that  the  patriarchal fetters of
society, which continue to be active today, would dissolve as well.
## MEANING
One of the greatest strengths of the Economy for the Common Good would
be that earning money would no longer constitute the goal, the side effects
of  which  would be  (assuming  things went well) satisfaction of  needs,
prosperity and  meaningful activity.  It  would be  the  other way  around:
satisfaction of needs, common good and meaningful activity would be the
goal, and the founding and managing of companies would constitute means
of  fulfilling  that  goal. If  participation in  the  production process and
engagement in gainful occupation become easier in systemic terms (for the
founders of companies as well as for persons employed by others), if the
possibility of  amassing material  wealth is  limited and  if  the  climate of
society as a whole promotes meaningful relationships then there is justified
hope that more people will select their workplace in accordance with their
potential for investing it with meaning and (be able to) shape it accordingly.

And meaning is a powerful source of motivation, if not the most powerful
one.  It  provides intrinsic motivation and  has  a  stronger effect  than  does
extrinsic motivation, which causes people to  act  through external
incentives, rewards and  punishments. If  I  decide to  do  something of  my
own free volition because I deem it to be purposeful then I usually do it
gladly. I devote myself to it with all my energy and undivided attention. If I
am intrinsically motivated to perform a task it does not occur to me to peer
over to the left or right to see what “the competition” is doing. This would
merely distract  me,  disturb my  concentration and  thus weaken my
performance. (Unless of course I am someone who is spurred on to perform
well out of fear or whose self-esteem relies on outdoing others.) Those who
are extrinsically motivated are heteronomously reliant on the relative status
of their competitors. Their motivation abates the moment they are superior
to their competitors for, after all, it is not the activity itself which motivates
them. And if someone loses out often or chronically, motivation will vanish
as well. People withdraw from competition humiliated and end up in a state
of unemployment, homelessness, depression and dire poverty. In the UK,
13.3 million individuals live in poverty, including one out of three young
adults – 6 percent more than a decade ago in Britain.
## 8
In 19 out of 28 EU
member states, youth unemployment rates have climbed to  over  twenty
percent.
## 9
Market capitalism, if measured in terms of the expectation that it
should provide all human beings with meaningful, humane work conditions,
is in fact a system that is as inhumane as it is inefficient. Why then is the
belief in  the  benefit of  competition so  deeply rooted and  so  seldom
questioned?
What comes now is, from my perspective, the most unpleasant part of
this analysis, the part which will allow us to understand why competition is
so firmly enthroned in our value system. Many – possible the majority of us
– are not intrinsically motivated (or at best to a very weak degree) because
they do not know themselves well enough and do not discover any aspect of
themselves that might spur them on  to  top  performance without
competition. They are  empty inside and  can  only  find  meaning outside
themselves. And  if  the  outside world constantly clamours for  money,  a
career, success and power, viewing these as the “values” that count, then
they internalize many of these values even if these values have never made
any  human being happy.  But  since so  many buy  into  this  belief  and  the
media constantly portray and honour such people, a large proportion of the

population emulates them – people who have no real sense of their own
selves. Thus the root of the problem lies in inwardly impoverished people
who are incapable of investing their own lives with meaning; they lack the
self-confidence needed to  recognize themselves as  being ultimately
responsible for their own lives and their own decisions.
The crucial question is: Where does this inner emptiness come from?
Why is it that so many people are incapable of investing their own lives
with meaning and finding happiness? In my view the key lies in education.
Most of  us  were  not  impartially recognized  and  unconditionally loved,
which would have allowed us to find our own self, accept ourselves with
love and develop the same deep appreciation for others; instead, many – at
least the older generation – were raised to be obedient and perform well. If
parents have a certain image, a concrete notion of how we should be, they
will  lose  sight of  who  we  really are.  Children are  not  able  to  recognize
themselves in otherness because they are not “mirrored” by their parents or,
what is worse, are punished if they attempt to do so. In order to avoid losing
the love of their parents, most children “decide” in favour of obedience, and
the first “order” given by very many parents is that their children perform
(and  thus  abnegate themselves).Thus children learn early on  to  suppress
their own feelings, needs and thoughts – feeling, thinking and wanting what
they should feel, think and want instead. Of course, this does not happen in
extreme ways in  the  sense that  children either just  become motivated
intrinsically and develop their personal meaning of life in full autonomy –
or suppress their inner self and only adopt extrinsic values whilst clinging
to the illusion that these values will lead them to happiness. But the societal
tendency leads in this direction. And it is enough that culture hands down
“extrinsic” values such as competition, profit seeking and careerism from
generation to generation and that the majority of human beings now believe
that  this  is  their nature merely because the  majority of  those in  their
generation, who were raised to believe this way, behave accordingly.
Children who have not learned to perceive their own feelings, needs and
thoughts but  rather to  be  rewarded by  “love” for  obedience and
performance will  attempt to  get  love  through performance for  the  entire
course of their lives. They will not question what they are doing – or if they
do,  only half-heartedly –  and  will soon accept money for  their
accomplishments until they do practically nothing any more which is not
financially remunerated. In this way money becomes the highest good for

the inwardly impoverished. This explains why a remarkable number of rich
people are inwardly impoverished to such a large extent.
A further consequence of all this is that those who do not have a sense of
themselves lack  a  sense of  others –  and  of  the  environment. Empathy
requires a  fine  sense of  self-perception. This is  a  crucial reason why
successful men  and  women often have fewer scruples when it  comes to
pushing for  economic “success”  at  the  cost  of  social and  ecological
detriment. Inner emptiness desensitizes people and  hardens them. The
values inherent in the capitalistic system shape them into ruthless executors
of  the  system objective –  increasing profit –  no matter the  cost. (Bare
figures are their only source of orientation. They must reduce themselves to
what is  calculable.) Socio-medical studies show that  among top-tier
economic decision makers – as compared to the average population – one
finds a  significantly higher proportion of  socio-pathological personalities
who  are  incapable of  empathy and  compassion, who  are  narcissistic and
prone to addiction.
## 10
Such selection is a fatal effect of our current economic
system, and more and more of those affected by this are beginning to realize
and  admit it.  As  the  former head of  the  German Postal Service  and  tax
evader Klaus Zumwinkel confessed, “In  my  twenty years as  a  chief
executive I learned that markets are essentially soulless”.
## 11
One of Austria’s
few female top executives, Brigitte Ederer, reports on the effects of her job:
“You become harsher towards yourself and towards others.”
## 12
Is this not a
catastrophe?
To  reverse the  effects of  such social conditioning, measures taken to
reverse market incentives –  promoting recognition, assessment and
remuneration of  cooperative, solidarity-based, empathic, responsible and
generous behaviours – are not enough. We need to start by fulfilling the
prerequisite for  implementing these  measures, which is  that  parents love
their children unconditionally and  accept and  esteem them as  they  are.
From a parent’s perspective this certainly does not mean letting them get
away with everything, allowing them to  grow up  without guidance or
agreeing with  all  their opinions but  rather it  means (a)  perceiving their
feelings, needs and thoughts, (b) taking them seriously and (c) encouraging
them to do so themselves. It is only then that we can ask what feelings,
needs and opinions the parents have; in fact they are often quite different.
But with the help of respectful and nonviolent communication it is possible
to learn that different, in part contradictory needs and opinions exist which

do not necessarily pose any insurmountable hindrance to communal life and
meaningful relationships. On the contrary: since we are all unique and thus
in principle different, relationships in which partners do not have differing
needs and opinions are inconceivable. Thus we should always assume that
our  colleagues, partners, friends  –  and  children –  have different needs,
feelings and  opinions to  our  own and  we  should aspire to  take  these
seriously and value them – rather than attempting to confrontationally assert
our  own  opinions, needs and  interests vis-à-vis others. We  have now
returned to the beginning of the book: to the aspect of mutual treatment
under the guiding light of human dignity instead of the pursuit of one’s own
benefit. This interpersonal dimension is so fundamental that it should play a
key role in our educational system.
## CHILDREARING AND EDUCATION
One  of  the  most important prerequisites and  conditions for  a  flourishing
Economy for  the  Common Good involves conveying new values,
sensitizing people  to  their own  human existence, rehearsing social and
communicative competence, and  setting an  example when it  comes to
respect for  nature. For  this  reason I  propose seven basic subjects for  all
levels of  school which I  deem to  be  more important than  most of  the
subjects currently  being taught. They are: understanding feelings;
understanding values; nonviolent communication; understanding
democracy; understanding and experiencing nature; crafts; and sensitizing
the body.
- Understanding feelings
Here children would gain the experience of perceiving feelings, taking them
seriously, not being ashamed of them, talking about them, and regulating
them consciously.  Nonviolent communication has  shown that  myriads of
conflicts in relationships remain unresolved because human beings do not
succeed in talking about their feelings and needs – particularly if they have
never learned how to do so. Instead they reproach those who do not fulfil
their needs and thus trigger a sense of injury for all kinds of things which
divert attention from their own  needs and  feelings, the  actual matter at
hand, hurting others in the process. An endless spiral of injury is the result,

with the problem persisting and no prospect for a resolution of the conflict
in sight.
## 13
- Understanding values
Here various attitudes towards values are taught and discussed in the sense
of developing the critical faculty. This should also include making children
aware of  subconsciously held  values. For  example, children would learn
that they are capable of competing against each other and what the effects
of this are, but also that they are capable of cooperation and can see what
the effects of this are too. In an overview they learn the fundamental ethical
principles of various philosophical ideas and religions.
- Nonviolent communication
Here children start by  learning  how to  listen, heed others, take  them
seriously and  discuss matters objectively without resorting to  personal
insult or value judgements. This might seem banal but we are aeons away
from an  appreciative and  nonviolent culture of  public discourse. Even
opinion makers and  prominent citizens in  many realms adopt  the  wrong
tone. For  example, in  the  past  Attac and  I  have been referred to  by  the
media and public figures as  “stuck in  adolescence”, “martial”,
“communist”, ”nauseatingly populist”, “swaggering hero of anticapitalists”
and  also  as  “a  spiritual mentor of  terrorism”. Apparently some opinion
leaders are  unable to  tolerate different opinions. Yet  a  democratic and
nonviolent culture of  discourse  is  characterized by  the  very  fact  that  we
treat those who think differently with respect – by arguing exclusively on a
substantive level.
In the class on understanding communication, children would also learn
about differences in  the  ways men  and  women communicate so  as  to
become aware of role patterns and thus become able to discard them. In the
same way,  intercultural communication skills could be  taught. And,
generally,  that misunderstandings are the norm and generating
understanding always takes a certain amount of effort.
## 14
- Understanding democracy
Democracy is viewed as the highest value in the West, and yet the way this
value can be lived and sustained – through intervention, having a say and

advancing co-determination in all areas of public life – is hardly a matter
that is taught at school. Democracy is presented as a reliable historical fact,
not as a fragile, vulnerable accomplishment which can be lost at any time.
In fact, it can be argued that it has already been lost because the majority of
people, having no means of participation, have turned away from the public
sphere in  disgust and  frustration, and  because other enticements –
consumption, entertainment and  drugs –  are  thrust upon them by  an
economic order which suffocates the spirit and is antagonistic towards the
public and democracy.
Understanding democracy could include the following elements:
•how to incorporate many interests into one rule;
•how decisions are made that are as acceptable as possible for everyone;
•that appreciative encounters with others who have different needs are the
prerequisite for satisfactory decision-making processes that are
supported by a broad majority;
•that alert commitment on the part of all is required so that particularized
interests cannot be asserted;
•that democratic responsibility cannot be delegated but rather only the
power to implement decisions.
And most of all: that democracy has just begun. We have only savoured
about one tenth of what is possible through democracy; the experience of
“real democracy”  –  the  motto of  the  Occupy movement –  has  yet  to  be
created. More on that in the next chapter.
- Understanding and experiencing nature
An economy that relies on persistent increases in profit, income, assets and
material goods is sick in the sense that it has lost all sense of proportion; it
is  “absolute” and  detached from all  other values and  their natural
foundation, the  planetary ecosystems. An  inability to  connect and  the
difficulty that many people have in relating to themselves, to other human
beings, to their natural environment and to the larger scheme of things is the
core of this illness. Healing can consist of re-embracing these relationships,
nurturing them and bringing them into equilibrium, which is a reliable path
to happiness. Countless human beings in all cultures report that having an

intense, appreciative relationship to  the  environment, to  living creatures,
rivers, cliffs,  clouds and  deserts  have a  healing effect.  Spending  several
hours in intense communion with nature will most likely mean finishing the
day with a sense of elation. In this subject children will not only learn how
to  identify  plants, animals, bodies of  water and  stones; they  will  also
experience the healing effect that nature has on their peace of mind. Wind
and  rain,  clouds and  water,  stars,  flowers, the  mountains, tranquillity –
whoever has a deep connection to nature is likely to find little of appeal in
shopping centres, the stock market, or even the possession of a car. In any
case, experiencing a  year  of  reduced material consumption can  mean an
increase in  the  intensity and  quality of  life  –  even though, from the
perspective of  classic market economists, this  means a  betrayal  of  the
economy, destruction of production sites and recession.
## 6. Crafts
The “couch potatoes” generation spends an increasing amount of time in
virtual space sitting at computers, talking on mobiles, watching television
or  using  any  number of  other electronic devices and  media. This  virtual
world separates human beings from the materiality of nature and the tasks
devoted to manually processing it. One essential element of a holistic life
lies in encounters with materials and substances, tools and shapes, colours
and smells. We do not all have to become master craftspeople but we should
all experience what it feels like to produce something manually and to give
it to someone who can put it to good use. Rudolf Steiner, the founder of
anthroposophy,  advocated developing a  comprehensive programme for
enabling pupils to come into contact with the “practice” of life, and for this
reason Steiner schools include internships in  forestry,  various  trades and
social institutions in their curriculum. It is important to provide sufficient
time for these activities so as to connect the self with the task at hand and
unfold the  entire creative potential that  young people have. Fashioning
useful things oneself creates meaning, and  making gifts makes people
happy. And if some of these young people become master craftspeople or
artisans, this is very beneficial for society.
- Sensitizing the body
Che Guevara reportedly said: “Solidarity is the tenderness of the people.”
But  how  should all  states treat  each other with  tenderness if  we  do  not

succeed in being tender to ourselves? Many of us eat badly, get too little
exercise, show little physical affection, rarely massage ourselves or others
even though this is one of the fastest ways to reach happiness for all the
people I  have met  so  far.  If  we  compared the  time  we  spend  shopping,
watching television and earning money with the time spent giving or getting
a massage, the sad subordination of physical touch and tenderness would be
revealed. The human body is an endlessly sensitive organism and we all
possess the disposition that allows us to sense things so finely that each step
and each contact with an object can lead to a deep sensual experience or
massage of the inner self. With sensitivity training, the quality of life would
increase to  such a  degree that  there would hardly be  any  time left  for
nonsensual experience. The  weaker the  sensual element, the  weaker
physical self-perception is, the more these privations must be compensated
for by money, power or other drugs.
For this reason children should be helped to develop a fine, attentive and
appreciative relationship to their own body, their creativity and authenticity
early on. This can begin with games, dance and group acrobatics and later,
after puberty,  be  expanded to  include elements of  bodywork,  massage,
energy work and yoga.

## ADVANCING DEMOCRACY
Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been
tried from time to time.
## Winston Churchill
¡Democracia real ya!
## Indignados
Genuine democracy is not a hollow phrase.
## Albert Einstein
## 1
Formally speaking  we  live  in  a  democracy,  but  compared to  the  period
before accelerated globalization and  financialization, fewer and  fewer
people feel that they really have a say in any aspect of social life. There is
an increasing tendency for governments to make decisions that contradict
the needs and interests of the population at large. These involve such issues
as:
•deregulation of financial markets, allowing for speculation against
systemic stability and the common good;
•privatization of public services such as drinking water and energy
suppliers, railways, postal services and banks;
•the unleashing of global site competition through “free trade
agreements”;
•liberalization of capital transfers to tax havens;
•tolerance of income inequality up to a factor of 350,000;
•implementation of gene technology in agriculture, legalization of patents
on life forms;

## •the Euratom Treaty;
•the commitment to rearmament in the EU Lisbon Treaty;
•repression of demonstrators at the Copenhagen Climate Conference;
•torture in Guantánamo;
•the attack on Iraq which violated international law;
•and since 2008 the bank rescue policies enacted for the benefit of large,
system-relevant corporations without fragmenting them.
If procedures of direct democracy had been employed, in most countries
there would likely have been no majority to back any of these decisions.
And yet  they were formally taken by  democratically legitimized
governments and  parliaments. There are  several reasons for  the  growing
distance between the  citizens and  their representatives, which political
scientists call “the crisis of representation”.
1.A voter who can only elect a party platform every four or five years has
almost no control over anything because election promises are just as
inflated as they are non-binding. If governments do not fulfil the
promises they make, we as voters are almost completely powerless. If
we want to “punish” a government that has failed to fulfil any
particularly important promise, we must wait for the next election. But
even then, how are we going to sanction them? Do we have to change
parties to do this? Does any party even exist whose platform is more
agreeable to us in total? What if no party is standing for election whose
platform addresses the issues most important to us? And would the
“punished” party even understand what it is being punished for as we
have no avenues for taking it to task for any individual decisions it
makes, but can only punish it for its performance during the legislative
period as a whole?
2.The economic elite are merging with the political elite to ever-
increasing degrees. Top managers often move into government and
political office holders become lobbyists for large corporations through
an ever-faster “revolving door”.
## 2
One emblematic example out of many
is the former EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan who became
Chairman of the LOTIS Committee of International Financial Services
London (IFSL), a lobby group representing the UK financial industry.
## 3

Another example is Sharon Bowles. As the chairperson of the European
Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, she led
important negotiations over EU rules governing the London Stock
Exchange. In August 2015, Bowles joined the London Stock Exchange
Group’s board of directors as a non-executive director.
## 4
A very recent
example is Jonathan Hill who was nominated by the UK prime minister
David Cameron to become EU Commissioner purely for Financial
Services and Financial Stability. Hill refused to hand out a complete list
of his past interests as a lobbyist to the Members of the European
## Parliament.
## 5
Thanks to the revolving-door phenomenon, the roles of regulators
and the regulated become blurred. In the aftermath of 2008, the most
powerful bankers drafted bank rescue bills and parliaments sign them.
The problem with such social intimacy between politics and business is
that it becomes more critical the richer and more powerful the economic
elite become. This shows that the economic elite themselves constitute
the problem – and this confirms the demand for limiting inequity. The
material elite stand in contradiction to a democratic society in which all
human beings should have equal rights, equal opportunities and equal
possibilities for co-determination.
3.Such elites also have a disproportionate influence on the leading media:
through personal contacts with senior journalists who cultivate such
contacts so as to secure valuable sources of information, through values
which they share with the media elite (since powerful people who are
keen on keeping their power are highly cooperative), through
advertising which the media are economically dependent upon and
which they adjust their editorial line to, through direct control of
property, and again, thanks to revolving doors. For instance, before its
split in 2013, the supervisory board of Rupert Murdoch’s News
Corporation contained two former heads of government, José María
Aznar from Spain and Alvarez Uribe from Colombia. Besides
entanglement, media corporations become too concentrated and
powerful: in the USA in 2011, only six corporations controlled 90
percent of the US media.
## 6
4.Mainstream academia sometimes even subscribes to the opinions of
those in power. To be sure, “free” universities provide space for

alternative approaches, but the “mainstream” is confluent with the
agenda of the powerful because (a) many intellectuals come from “good
families” and promote the interests of their own “class”; (b) due to
ongoing liberalization, universities are increasingly dependent on
external funds from industry; and (c) private interest groups generate a
lack of public funds but also take advantage of this lack by positioning
their ideological propagators inside colleges and universities by
installing guest professorships. The University of Illinois’s College of
Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences (ACES) in
Champaign-Urbana has accepted a $250,000 grant from genetically
modified seed/agrichemical giant Monsanto to create an endowed chair
for the so-called Agricultural Communications Program it runs with the
College of Communications.
## 7
On the other hand, scientists whose
insights endanger corporate interests are denied research funding, and
may find their jobs and careers threatened.
## 8
5.Think tanks work for those who fund them. These are usually
influential economic circles whose needs have little in common with
those of the population at large. In the USA, the American Legislative
Exchange Council (ALEC) sounds smart and scientific, but in fact is a
privately funded council of politicians and members of the business
elite who actually write legislation and then have their members push
for it in Congress. Meanwhile, in Germany, the nicely named New
Social Market Economy Initiative is not so much a circle of intellectuals
committed to the Enlightenment or ethics in business as it is a campaign
instigated by powerful industrial employers’ associations striving to
dismantle the solidarity-based social welfare state.
## 9
6.Political parties are financed by corporations, and in the USA the
members of Congress are directly financed by lobbyists – with
predictable results. Here are two examples. Members of Congress who
voted for the regulation of financial derivatives received a total of only
US$940,000, whereas those who voted against them received US$27
million. Those who supported regulation of the US Federal Reserve
received US$40,000, whereas those who opposed it received US$10
million. The bill failed miserably.
## 10

As a result of these conditions and developments, democracy is in serious
crisis. If  we  allow the  economic inequities, lobbyism and  media
concentration to persist and reduce “democracy” to the act of ticking a box
for a political party every four or five years, it will inevitably erode to the
point of dissolution. If a living democracy is to be created, the entwinement
of politics and business must be dissolved and limitations must be put on
inequity.  What is  equally needed,  though, is  an  extension of  democratic
participation, plus rights of regulation never seen before in history. As many
people as  possible must be  able  to  engage in  discussions, participate in
decision-making processes and  help  shape society at  as  many levels as
possible, and  they  must be  able  to  do  this  during the  periods  between
parliamentary elections and in all democratic areas of social and economic
life as well.
## WE ARE THE SOVEREIGN!
The  basic  precondition for  achieving a  renaissance of  democracy is  the
creation of an awareness of what the sovereign actually is or should be. The
word “sovereign” comes from the  Latin word superanus,  which means
“standing above all”. Whereas during the age of absolutism the king was
the Sovereign who stood above all, the Enlightenment and the bourgeois
revolutions brought about the  notion that  the  general population should
actually have this  role.  Yet  such  theoretical entitlement hardly manifests
itself in  any  modern-day democracy.  The  only  sovereign rights that  the
citizens possess are to elect political parties and to have the final say in
fundamental changes to the constitution. This is not enough to constitute
genuine sovereignty. Genuine sovereignty would also entail the sovereign
being able to:
1.elect a certain government;
2.de-elect a government;
3.correct its parliament in regard to any proposed legislation;
4.put bills to the vote itself;
5.change the constitution on its own initiative;
6.elect a convention directly;

7.control and regulate important essential utilities itself;
8.stake out the framework for negotiation of international treaties and
vote on the results of such negotiations.
There is such a weak sense of what the sovereign should entail that most of
us do not even realize that we, the public, lack the basic tools required to act
as the democratic sovereign in our countries. We do not learn this at school.
During lectures I often ask which instrument should be placed in the hands
of a “sovereign” first. This question usually elicits awkward, widespread
silence. Some hesitatingly say “elections”; others timidly ask: “passing a
law?”
If  the  sovereign  really “stands over all”  and  the  only purpose of
democracy is  to  implement its  will  –  the  common will  of  the  largest
possible majority – then the sovereign should be able to propose and pass
laws by its own efforts at any time! But at present this is impossible in the
individual member states of  the  EU,  as  well  as  in  the  EU  as  a  whole,
because our representatives have a monopoly on initiating laws. In the EU
member states it  lies  with  each  nation’s  government and  parliament and
EU-wide it  lies  with the  Commission, the  Council and  the  Parliament.
Supplementing indirect (“representative”) democracy with   direct
democracy would constitute a  logical implementation of  the  principle of
separating power between the people and their representatives. A clearer
separation of powers would make for a tangible increase in democracy and
greater trust in this form of government.
## EXPANSION OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS
Fundamental principles rarely remain uncontested. The democratic
principle of the separation of power is a fortunate exception. The division of
state authority into the legislative, the executive and the judicial branches
and reciprocal control thereof is taken as self-evident. We ponder too little
on what the basic idea behind such separation of power really is, however.
The  objective is  to  prevent power  from being too  concentrated and  thus
subject to  misuse. Hence, no  institution should be  so  disproportionately
powerful in  relation to  others  as  to  endanger freedom –  in  this  case
collective freedom, which is to say, democracy. Since so much is at stake,

the principle of separation of power merits the most intensive reflection and
systematic advancement possible.
We  have  already begun to  elucidate the  first step required for
implementing such advancement: more efficient division of power between
the  sovereign people and  its  representation. But  why  does a  sovereign
people elect representatives in  the  first  place? Since a  nation state is
inhabited by so many people, it is not feasible to let everyone participate in
the  agreements it  makes. Grassroots democracy has  its  limits, and  these
limits are defined by the number of people who can actively participate in
the democratic process. Thus division of labour is the principle behind the
election of governments and parliaments. The task is not to create a new
organ  which is  placed over the  sovereign people for  its  own sake;
governments and  parliaments  are  merely its  representatives, whose
exclusive purpose consists in implementing/fulfilling the majority will of
the  sovereign people. There is  no  guarantee that  any  given government
actually does this, however, and the temptation to misuse power which has
been temporarily leased increases in proportion to the limitations put on the
rights of the sovereign people and the unfettered clout which some interest
groups continue to have vis-à-vis government. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau
wrote in 1762: “Nothing is more dangerous than the influence of private
interests on  public affairs.”
## 11
It  would  be  ruinous if  the  hands of  the
sovereign contractor were to  be  bound until the  next  award of  contract
(election), it being left with no more than the feeble hope that government
might fulfil its  will. But  this  is  an  increasingly common scenario.
Governments and parliaments are transformed into “temporary
dictatorships” because they submit to the most pressing lobby groups, are
infiltrated by them or even welcome them into their ranks. The overlooked
sovereign people can protest and demonstrate but what good does this do if
it has no rights? Does it not make more sense for the democratic sovereign
– as the supreme actor – to be able to correct his agent at any time if the
latter does not do what the former wants it to do? Rousseau felt that the
sovereign should be able to “limit, amend and nullify the power which it
bestowed on the government whenever it choses”.

## A THREE-STEP DIRECT DEMOCRACY

In concrete terms this means, for one thing, that the sovereign population
would have the right to reject any bills that it deemed unacceptable through
a majority vote. And, second, that it would have the right to draft bills and
pass laws which were not in keeping with the government‘s “agenda”. Both
rights could be  asserted using the  same procedure, namely a  three-step
direct democracy. This is an idea which a growing number of organizations
are now demanding.
## 13
•First step: every citizen or group of citizens could collect declarations of
support for a desired bill.
•Second step: if this draft bill found a sufficient number of supporters,
for example 0.5 percent of the population eligible to vote, a petition for a
nationwide referendum would be initiated.
•Third step: if this petition – the collection of signatures at polling sites
all over the country – made it over a further, larger hurdle such as 3
percent, an obligatory referendum would be held, the results of which
would become legally binding law.
The  “third step” is  currently applied not  only at  the  national level in
Switzerland, but also in California in the USA. Here the citizens are the
actual sovereign.  In  Germany,  Austria, Italy and  most other  countries
including the USA at the federal level, the parliament has the last word.
And it has the capacity to go against the will of the people and build nuclear
power plants, allow capital to flee to tax havens, legalize patents on life
forms, rescue system-relevant banks with taxpayers’ money, and participate
in wars of aggression which violate international law.
Direct democracy is gaining ground all over the globe, however. From
1951 to 1960 a total of 52 national referendums were held worldwide; from
1991 to 2000 the number increased to 200, and in the first decade of the
third millennium the number rose to about a thousand.
## 14
In Germany this
instrument has  been introduced in  all  the  states in  the  1990s  and  also
generalized on  the  communal level. And  in  South Tyrol, Italy,  an  initial
form of direct democracy is winning one stage victory after another. The
first form of direct democracy was introduced in 2005 but it did not fulfil
the  expectations of  the  initiators in  the  population. For  this  reason they
instigated a referendum in 2009 to push through the model developed by

the  citizens’  movement. The  referendum went their way  with an  83.2
percent majority.  But  the  government declared the  referendum invalid
because the turnout which the government itself had defined as necessary
for passing the referendum (40 percent) was not reached; the turnout was
only 38.2 percent. Nevertheless,  the  government promised to  pass an
improved law,  but  the  drafts for  this  law  gave no  indication of  any  real
improvements. For  this  reason the  movement organized yet  another
referendum, which rejected the state law with a majority of 65.2 percent. A
new federal state law is expected in 2015 which will move further in the
direction of the citizens’ expectations, a true struggle!
Despite this  general tendency towards more democracy,  many have
grave misgivings and apprehensions about direct democracy. Taxes might
increase, right-wing populists could stir up hatred against minorities, the
death penalty might be reintroduced. The core of such fears is the notion
that the general public is not as enlightened and reasonable as an elected
government is. The Swiss referendum in 2009 to prevent the construction of
new mosque minarets, and also Proposition 8 in California, seems to have
confirmed such apprehensions. For this reason I want to discuss the most
common misgivings concerning direct democracy and clarify the issue of
basic rights using the Swiss referendum on minarets as an example.
Myth no. 1: But we already have representative democracy.
It’s an old trick. If someone calls for work breaks or holidays, the response
he or she sometimes gets is: “But work is not a bad thing!” Just as breaks
and holidays do not call the value of work into question but rather make it
more productive, direct democracy does not intend to replace representative
democracy but rather to supplement it in meaningful ways. Parliaments may
keep their role  as  regulatory legislators but  if  they  pass  a  bill  that  runs
contrary to  the  will  of  the  sovereign people, the  latter must have the
possibility of correcting its representatives. Or if the platforms of all parties
campaigning for seats in parliament lack something that is important to the
democratic sovereign, this should have the right to draft a bill itself. And if
the  electorate chooses a  certain government but  wishes to  change things
concerning a certain issue, it should get both of the things they want: the
preferred government and the laws of their choice. What matters is that the
sovereign people should have the last word.

Myth no. 2: The people can “de-elect” their government.
In the most unfavourable case, this takes four or five years. Governments
have a tendency to make unpopular decisions right after they are elected so
they can sprinkle more sugar around as the next election approaches. By
then much has been forgotten and it would often not even be in the interests
of the disappointed voters to stop voting for a political party just because of
one or two gross errors if overall they are satisfied with the government’s
performance. Generally speaking,  parliamentary elections are  inefficient
because the electorate can only choose between large bundles of campaign
promises which may  or  may  not  be  kept, and  in  the  case  of  coalition
governments the  blame can  also  be  put  on  the  party’s  partner.  Direct
democracy would allow the  democratic sovereign to  isolate individual
issues and decide on them itself. Democracy would become more efficient
and  satisfactory  if  the  people were not  deprived of  their right to  make
decisions between elections but rather had the opportunity to shape society
through their own initiative.
Myth no. 3: The people are uneducated.
As a rule, fundamental decisions are ethical decisions and in this respect all
human beings are  similarly competent –  irrespective of  their degree of
education. There is no indication that society’s elite has an above-average
measure of  nobleness of  heart. On  the  contrary,  power corrupts people’s
characters. A strong intellect alone does not guarantee anything except for
the  ability  to  commit crimes in  a  more subtle fashion. Austria has
experienced two  referendums: that  regarding the  Zwentendorf nuclear
power plant  and  that  regarding accession to  the  EU.  Concerning  one  of
them, the government and the people had different opinions: on the issue of
whether to  introduce nuclear power or  not.  In  this  controversy,  the
sovereign people proved to be the more prudent, voting “no”, but one of the
most aggressive  arguments brought forth in  this  context was  that  the
population “did  not  understand” the  complexities of  nuclear science and
that such “factual issues” should be clarified by experts. The problem of
corrupt expertocracy has been exacerbated in recent years. Ministers and
members of parliament would rather listen to lobbyists than to experts with
a sense of ethical integrity. Why did thirteen EU governments go to war in
Iraq? The “knowledge” argument does not stick.

Myth no. 4: Decisions are too complex.
This argument was implemented in connection with the Treaty of Lisbon of
2009, which amended the founding treaties of the EU. But to begin with,
the governments were the ones who created a 500-page monster to keep the
democratic sovereigns from having a  say  by  advancing the  argument of
“complexity” rather than presenting a short and comprehensive constitution.
By  contrast, the  USA gets  by  fine  with a  10-page document  (without
amendments). Second, surveys showed that most of the representatives of
the national parliaments did not have the slightest inkling what the Treaty of
Lisbon contained  and  for  this  reason they  were not  the  least bit  more
qualified to vote on it than the general population was.
## 15
An example from
France shows us that referendums actually create a highly informed general
public. Books on the EU’s constitutional treaty were on the best-seller lists
there for months; more than a million copies were sold. In countless public
discussions the individual articles of the treaty were debated with fervour
into  the  early hours. If  the  people are  allowed to  have a  say,  they  will
engage with politics, as the French have proven.
Finally, the most difficult decision of all – the election of a political party
– is expected of voters “directly”. If the people are presumably too dumb to
make prudent decisions, why should they be asked to perform such a feat?
Myth no. 5: This will open the door to rabble-rousing populists.
Rabble-rousing populists are not a speciality of direct democracy. They also
campaign in parliamentary elections, and in part they do this so successfully
that  they get  seats  in  governments. Would this  not  be  a  compelling
argument against  political parties and  parliaments? Other methods are
required for  coping with rabble-rousing populism than  the  rejection of
direct democracy. Here’s a hot tip: if governments and parliaments really
want to prevent right-wing extremism from gaining in strength, they should
finally take  measures to  combat growing inequality and  social division
rather than impeding direct democracy.
Myth no. 6: The Sun or Fox News would form a de facto government.
This  is  another killer argument.  But  it  is  not  an  argument against direct
democracy (worldwide), but  rather an  argument in  favour of  a  law  that
would prevent concentration of media power. Irrespective of this, can one

claim that  the Sun  or  Fox  News has  no  influence on  representative
democracy? Once  again, the  conclusion to  be  drawn is  not  that
representative democracy should be prevented but rather that the power of
the Sun and Fox News should be curbed.
Myth no. 7: The death penalty will be reinstated.
And in principle it is right. Theoretically speaking, a majority could vote in
favour of the death penalty. Precautions, which I will discuss shortly, would
have to be taken to prevent this. But exactly the same holds for indirect
democracy, for who is going to protect us against an elected government
which reintroduces the  death penalty or  torture? Guantánamo is  not  the
result of a referendum. The most recent infringements on civil rights and
even wars have been the  work  of  parliaments, not  citizens! If  anything,
constitutions and the European Convention on Human Rights safeguard us
against violations of human rights. The logical consequence is to see that
these ultimate custodians of civil rights also apply for indirect democracy,
and not only for direct democracy – which, by the way, is clearly demanded
by social movements which advocate for it.
My argument concerning this is that democracy, be it direct or indirect, is
only a means. The equality of all human beings, their equal value – human
dignity – is the purpose. Equal rights for all derive from the equal value of
all human beings, and one of these rights is the right to co-determination.
Understandably,  the  means should never be  allowed to  eliminate the
purpose. Thus all contemporary direct democracy initiatives demand that no
previously recognized human rights or  minority rights be  called into
question by direct democracy (or by indirect democracy for that matter),
and  that  democracy itself must not  be  called into  question. Holding a
referendum on  whether to  dissolve parliament and  enthrone a  king is
theoretically conceivable but  it  should be  as  impermissible as  the
installation of  a  dictator by  parliament would be.  Minorities may  not  be
repressed by parliament or the people. Human rights either hold for all or
they do not hold at all. If they only held for some, democracy would cease
to exist because the people would no longer be equal – and this would make
every democratic procedure senseless. In such cases the constitution must
protect the people’s civil rights.

We  have arrived at  the  problem  concerning the  Swiss ban  on  the
construction of mosque minarets. Switzerland has had a direct democracy
since 1848. Accession to the European Human Rights Convention, which
the ban on the construction of mosque minarets violates in a twofold sense
(in that it violates the ban on discrimination and on freedom of religion),
did not occur until 1974. I do not understand how Switzerland can remain a
member of the European Human Right Convention. But I am sure that if the
Swiss had  to  decide between revoking the  referendum or  leaving the
European human rights community, a majority of the citizens would vote
for equal rights for all, including religious minorities. In countries where
direct democracy promises to  be  introduced in  the  years to  come, the
“Minaret Initiative”, but  also  “Proposition 8”  in  California,  should be
inadmissible for negating equal rights for everybody. This is, from my point
of view, one of the weaknesses of the Californian system: that Proposition 8
was admissable, despite denying such equal rights.
## 16
Another weakness is
that (better) alternatives cannot be added to an approved ballot referendum.
According to a poll in 2011, 40 percent of Californians approved the death
penalty for murderers, but 48 percent preferred life in prison without parole,
instead.
## 17
Incidentally,  Switzerland abolished the  death penalty via  direct
democracy. If you look at the overall picture you find countless examples
which show that  the  democratic sovereign, when allowed to  decide for
itself, is more “prudent” than any government. Switzerland has the world’s
best railway; Austria and Italy have phased out nuclear power; privatization
of public utilities was prevented in Leipzig; the Canton of Zurich decided to
eliminate tax privileges for wealthy foreigners; Switzerland shortened its
compulsive military service and  introduced the  alternative of  a  “civilian
service”. These are all achievements of direct democracy. For this reason
people in Switzerland are more satisfied with their political system than the
inhabitants of Germany and Austria are with theirs. Some 82 percent of the
Austrian population are of the opinion that “the government does not take
the interests of the people into account”. Only 5 percent believe they have
“more say” through elections. Half of the German population thinks that
elections give them “no say”.
## 18
In times when governments are co-opted by
the economic elite to ever-increasing degrees (Colin Crouch speaks here of
## “post-democracy”,
## 19
I  prefer to  call it  “pre-democracy”
## 20
),  direct
democracy is  an  urgent  imperative. The  fact  that  the  sovereign people

desires this  should be  reason enough: 75  percent of  those loyal to  the
CSU/CDU party in Germany are in favour of direct democracy, as are 81
percent of those loyal to the SPD. During the period of French absolutism
Louis XIV said: “I am the state!” Today governments and parliaments act in
keeping with the slogan “We are the sovereign.” Regarding the EU Lisbon
Treaty the  representatives of  the  people who  drew it  up  and  enacted it
arrogated to themselves the right to decide what or what not the sovereign
people were  allowed to  vote  on.  If  governments and  parliaments  of  the
future knew that the sovereign people had the last word, they would take it
seriously.  And  the  sovereign citizens would be  able  to  transform their
disenchantment with politics and powerlessness into democratic initiative.
As Gerald Häfner, a co-founder of the pro-democracy organization Mehr
Demokratie e.V. puts it: “Direct democracy means abandoning the stance of
the spectator.”
## 21
## SEPARATION OF CONSTITUENT AND
## CONSTITUTIONAL POWER
The next step is the separation of the power that writes the constitution from
the  power instituted by  it.  In  political science the  attempt is  made to
distinguish “constituent power” (the sovereign) from “constitutional power”
(parliament, government). The idea behind this makes sense; if democratic
institutions were allowed to make the rules for governance themselves, they
would grant the people as few rights as possible so as to keep most of the
power themselves.  But  if  the  sovereign people wrote the  constitution, it
would most probably reserve the right to have the last word as well as the
right of co-determination and control.
This point is particularly relevant in the context of the development of
the  European Union. In  the  past,  basic treaties were always written by
governments. The population was excluded from the process of developing
new treaties and was also rarely allowed to vote on the final result. This
practice is becoming increasingly problematic to the extent that the EU is
being assigned new  competencies  and  is  slowly being invested  with a
statelike nature. In  addressing the  task  of  drawing up  the  so-called “EU
Constitution”, it  is  high time for  the  governments to  let  the  sovereign
citizens take the helm, for the title “Constitution” indicates the foundation

of a sovereign state and the sovereign power of any state must lie in the
hands of  the  population rather than  in  those of  the  government or  the
parliament. The  “Constitutional Treaty” was  in  fact  more than  a  mere
constitution; it  was  a  constitution accompanied by  political contracts all
packed into a monstrous 500-page bundle – a repellent manoeuvre directed
against democracy.
After two of the four voting sovereigns (nations) rejected the contractual
monster,  the  governments of  EU  member states resolved to  remove the
“constitutional accessories” of the text (for example in the use of the term
“laws”, a foreign “minister”, a flag and a hymn) and to push it through as an
“ordinary” treaty.  The  fact  that  they  simultaneously emphasized having
“rescued” 95 percent of the content reveals how an almost identical text
was  forced  upon the  sovereigns without them having any  right of  co-
determination whatsoever. Just one single sovereign, the Irish people, voted
on this revised document, and the result was a “no” as well. Since, from the
perspective of the sovereign’s representatives, the results of the vote were
not the one desired, another vote was organized. This constituted a further
serious abuse of  direct democracy.  Direct democracy should be  an
instrument of the sovereign which allows it to correct its government, not
an instrument of the government employed to correct the sovereign!
How could an EU treaty come about in a democratic fashion? Seventeen
European chapters of the activist organization Attac have made a concrete
proposal for how this could be achieved. To build people’s trust in the EU
and enable them to identify with it, these people would have to be involved
in building the “House of Europe”. If someone else builds the house and
lays down the house rules, this home will not be as cosy for its inhabitants
as it would be if they helped decide what it should look like and which rules
should apply to it. The proposal made by Attac is as follows: a democratic
assembly should be  elected, from the  population, which is  made up  of
representatives of  all  member states and  consists of  at  least  50  percent
women, whose task would be to write the new basic treaty, whether it is
called a constitution or not.
## 22
It  is  customary for  such assemblies to  be  called conventions. The
constitutional treaty was in fact written by a convention but this body was
not  installed by  the  sovereign people, but  by  the  governments. The
convention had no democratic rules of procedure, for the final decision lay
with a  thirteen-member praesidium rather than with the  plenum. The

praesidium also “overruled” the plenum when it spoke in favour of holding
referendums on  the  constitutional treaty in  all  member states. The
convention was a farce. Luxembourg’s prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker
observed: “I  have never seen a  darkroom that  was  darker  than the
convention.”
## 23
No wonder the final product of this darkroom was rejected
by three of the five sovereigns who were allowed to vote on it!
According to the proposal made by Attac, the sovereign peoples should
have the sole power to decide on the result of the democratic convention.
The probability that people would accept a treaty which (a) was written by
trusted persons who were elected directly for that express purpose, who (b)
maintained a lively exchange of ideas with the people during the editing
process and which (c) the sovereign peoples decided on exclusively, is very
high. I am convinced that it would be adopted by all the member states, for
the central political line of conflict does not run between “national states”
or the many diverse European “cultures” but rather between society’s elites
and the majority of the populations within the many states.
That the  final product of  a  genuinely democratic convention  would
probably be accepted can be verified elsewhere. In the Canton of Zurich the
process described above took  place between 1999 and  2005. It  entailed
direct election of  a  convention  whose task  was  to  write up  a  new
constitution involving intense exchange with the population and voting by
the democratic sovereign. The results were accepted with a clear majority
of 64.8 percent.
## 24
A  basic  treaty that  came about  democratically would not  only help
regain the trust of citizens in the EU; it would put the project of European
integration on a substantially different course. I bet that instead of fostering
liberties in business, competition between regions, blind freedom in regard
to capital transactions, unrestricted property rights, compulsory armament
and  institutional  democratic deficits, a  more democratic and  a  more
sustainable and  a  more peaceful EU  would evolve. Much of  what is
contained in  the  current treaties would never be  written into  documents
drawn up by the citizens. Instead, civil rights would be given top priority,
and these would create a flourishing framework for internal and external
peace, and, last but not least, for an Economy for the Common Good.
## AN ECONOMIC CONVENTION

Conventions can  have the  task  of  writing new  constitutions as  well  as
reformulating individual core elements of documents such as the Charter of
Fundamental Rights or the framework of values and objectives for business.
As I argued before, the current framework of values and objectives and the
systemic ground  rules (pursuit of  profit and  competition), which are  not
constitutional values, not only deviate from our basic human values but are
in  fact  diametrically opposed to  them. The  economy as  it  is  actually
constituted violates the  spirit of  constitutions. According to  the  German
Basic Law,  the  “use  of  property should serve the  welfare of  the  general
public”, and according to the Constitution of Bavaria, “all business activity
serves the  common good”. The preamble of  the  US  Constitution,
meanwhile, recalls that the people of the United States established it “in
order to promote the general Welfare”. We find little indication of this in
business. Constitutional values such as  human dignity,  solidarity and
democracy are demanded in business rarely, if at all. Pursuit of profit and
competition are not suitable rules for implementing these basic values.
The  proposed democratic economic convention would translate  these
constitutional values and objectives into ground rules which could lead to
successful implementation thereof through effective incentives. The
proposals are:  to  define the  pursuit of  the  common good as  the  goal  of
business protagonists, to measure the achievement of this goal in the form
of  a  Common Good Balance Sheet, to  measure the  success of  national
economies in the form of a Common Good Product, to promote cooperation
between enterprises,  to  establish ecological rights, and  to  limit  property
rights.
Ten  to  fifteen fundamental ground rules would suffice. The  part
concerning the economic constitution would probably be three to five pages
long. For the first time, ground rules would be set up for business using a
democratic procedure.
## A CONVENTION ON EDUCATION
Another convention could be  established to  address issues of  education.
Through the courses they set, our educational systems decide which human
beings will shape future society. Have these people learned how to listen to
each other, how to cooperate and respect the opinions of others? Or have

they  learned to  want to  be  better than  others, to  use  their elbows to  get
ahead and to disregard everything else for the sake of personal “success”?
Are they learning what it means to shape democracy or do they merely view
themselves as “private persons”? Do they experience what ultimately holds
the world together or are they stuffed full of disjointed bits of knowledge?
There is probably no sector that is more acutely impacted by frustration
on all sides than the educational sector. Pupils feel patronized and become
aggressive. Teachers feel overwhelmed and abused as  scapegoats.
Universities are  overly regimented and underfinanced. They are
increasingly compelled to behave like enterprises so as to procure external
funds from profit-oriented private business. External evaluation methods
create a climate of surveillance and control. Children and young adults are
forced to  adapt to  the  needs of  the  market and  the  globalized economy
instead of being able to develop into free individuals with a critical mindset.
Does this development comply with the ideal of free education? Why are
pupils and  parents not  allowed to  help  define curricula? Why does the
government reserve  the  right to  do  this? Is  this  not  a  matter that  affects
everyone? Are not those members of society who are affected by education
more intelligent in sum than a government that is beleaguered by interest
groups?
A  democratic convention for  education with  trusted delegates elected
from all areas affected by it – pupils, students, teachers, parents – which
defined the goals and core learning contents of the educational system as
well  as  determining  rights of  co-determination for  those involved  would
offer a way out of the dilemma. I wager that the learning content and the
curricula they chose would differ  substantially from what the  head of
Austria’s conservative party and Vice Chancellor Josef Pröll proposed in
2009 in his programmatic speech entitled “Project Austria” at the height of
the  financial crisis. His  proposal  was  that  “financial education” should
become a “component of every type of school education”.
## 25
Or, now that
the banks have become global casinos, the entire population should learn
how to have the greatest possible success playing at its gambling tables.
The fact  that the  only representative sent by  Austria to  the  EU
Commission’s task group of the same name (namely “Financial Education”)
is the managing director of the hedge funds firm Superfund, which lures its
clients with financial returns of 20 to 70 percent annually, says it all.
## 26
(The

two  German members come from the  banking association  and  the
association of insurers respectively.)
## 27
## A PUBLIC SERVICES CONVENTION
A third convention could define the area of cost-efficient public services.
The crucial question is: Which sectors of business are so essential (and in
many cases most easily organized in the form of uniform operation) that
they  should be  put  under the  complete control of  the  sovereign people?
According to  surveys, a  large  majority of  the  European population is  in
favour of a public postal service, a public railway system, a publicly funded
pension system, public health insurance and  public kindergartens and
universities. These public service operations could be  developed into
“democratic commons” via a public services convention. (In cases where
the population has been given the opportunity to vote, they have spoken out
in favour of maintaining public control over basic infrastructures.)
## A MEDIA CONVENTION
Another convention could address issues of the media so as to de-merge the
power of the media, business and politics with an aim towards cultivating a
more democratic media environment. Diversity and  deconcentration of
power could make for negative feedback in this area as well:
•no enterprise would be permitted to own part of more than one media
company;
•no media company would be dependent on any one advertiser for more
than 0.5 percent of its expenditures on advertising;
•new media with a start-up budget exceeding a defined threshold could
only be founded by at least five accredited journalists and at least ten
equally large owners.
No  government would even dream of  distributing media and  property
power. The only entity that would tackle and implement this rescue measure

for democracy would be the democratic sovereign. But direct democracy
would be needed to do this.
## A DEMOCRACY CONVENTION
Since the crisis in 2008 and the reaction of governments to this crisis (or the
lack of reaction), more and more people are realizing that the current model
of democracy is actually a dead-end street. Many civil society initiatives,
ranging from the  Occupy movement to  Attac, from the  Initiative and
Referendum Institute to  Democracy International, are  putting thought to
how democracy can be advanced, or rather how democracia real, as it is
called by the Spanish Indignados movement, could be achieved in the first
place. In  my  opinion this  is  one  of  the  largest  tasks facing us  over  the
coming years. All  forces that  desire more democracy will  have to  join
together to work out an innovative model of democracy in keeping with the
times and  then  strive to  make this  the  common demand of  a  wide-scale
civic alliance, which is to say, a civil rights movement that would really
make history.
The path to implementation could be a popular initiative, the demand for
a democracy convention, or, in this case, even a party. I personally tend to
think that  parties are  a  dead end  on  the  way  to  “genuine”  democracy
because they emphasize the factional rather than the mutual. What factions
propose is rejected by other factions out of principle – not for substantive
reasons. Party democracy calls for competition, but democracy should be
based on  cooperative procedures. I  am  not  able  to  offer  any  well-honed
solution here, but I suspect that processes will soon be found for satisfying
the needs of the community and making sustainable decisions without the
body politic being split up and wearing itself down as a result.
The democracy party, should one ever exist, would have one sole aim,
namely to give birth to the new model of democracy. Its platform would
address no substantive issues – no matter how much majority appeal these
might have – for these would distract too much from the task of formulating
new ground rules for decision-making processes. Moreover, proposals that
were capable of  winning a  majority could be  written into  law  after
implementation of the new rules – and with no party participation.

The search for a better model of democracy has begun. I believe it will
be the most important political project of the years to come.
## A THREE-PILLAR DEMOCRACY
In total the proposed measures would enable the current one-dimensional
model of democracy (which is solely representative) to evolve into a three-
dimensional democracy: an  indirect  democracy (representative), a  direct
democracy (involving conventions and  referendums) and  a  participative
democracy (involving co-determination in  business and  public services).
What it would ultimately achieve is a better division of labour among those
holding political power and those to whom – in part – such power was to be
delegated. That would still not constitute any “genuine democracy”, dear
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but it would at least be a first step in this direction.



## SEVEN
## REAL WORLD EXAMPLES
The  Economy for  the  Common Good is  not  a  utopia. Enterprises have
always pursued goals other than  profit gain. And  cooperation is  a  basic
principle not only of evolution,
## 1
but also of numerous alternative forms of
business which have been practised prior to,  alongside and  beyond
capitalism. More  people work full-time in  the  cooperatives of  the  world
than in  all  the  transnational corporations put  together.
## 2
## Banking
cooperatives modelled on  the  one  developed by  Friedrich Wilhelm
Raiffeisen exist in  180  countries across the  globe. Commons include
everything from  alpine pastures and  drinking water cooperatives to  free
software and internet applications. Notions like circulation economy, blue
economy, shared value and public value point to numerous alternatives, all
of which are committed to the same values. What all have in common is
that they view money and capital as mere means, whereas the goals they set
are of a higher and more diverse nature.
Within the private business sector thousands of enterprises already exist
– amidst global capitalism – that comply with most aspects of the Economy
for  the  Common Good. The  Economy for  the  Common Good wants to
make these practices visible and  reward them. The  following examples
testify to the existence of such practices, and of course they also stand for
many other  models. Together they  exert an  inspirational and  motivating
effect on many people and there are no reasonable grounds for not striving
to  shape a  full-scale entrepreneurial environment according to  their
collective example.
## 1. MONDRAGÓN – THE WORLD’S LARGEST
## COOPERATIVE (IN THE BASQUE REGION OF SPAIN)

The Basque Mondragón Corporación Cooperativa (MCC) is currently the
world’s largest cooperative. In 1943, after the end of the Spanish Civil War,
a  young priest named José María Arizmendiarrieta established a
polytechnic vocational school.  In  1956 five  graduates of  this  school
founded the first cooperative. Today the group is represented in nineteen
countries comprising 256 enterprises in  the  sectors of  mechanical
engineering, the automotive industry, the construction industry, household
appliances, retail trade, finance and insurance companies. They also have
their own cooperative bank, the Caja Laboral Popular.
83 percent of the approximately 75,000 employees are members of the
cooperative. The  aim  is  to  increase this  proportion to  90  percent. The
cooperative is based on the principle that all of its employed members are
fundamentally equal. The democratic company organization is reflected in
(a)  the  sovereignty of  the  general assembly,  which is  made  up  of  all
members of the cooperative and which operates on the principle of “one
person, one  vote”; (b)  democratic election of  members of  management
bodies, in  particular the  supervisory board, which reports to  the  general
assembly; and (c) collaboration with the executive organs, which are set up
to  manage the  cooperative on  the  instructions of  the  members of  the
cooperative as a whole.
A  small portion of  the  profits are  paid  out  to  the  employees but  the
largest part is reinvested. Another part of the profits flows into the Central
Fund for  Cooperation, which implements new  projects and creates new
jobs. If  a  business finds itself in  financial difficulties, the  losses can  be
absorbed through wage cuts if these are approved by the employees. In the
event of serious financial problems or order peaks, employees work in other
cooperatives for short periods of time. Up to 10 percent of the net profit
goes to  the  community and  is  invested in  education projects, which are
given very high priority. After all, this is how it all began. The Mondragón
Group has an overall turnover of 15 billion euros; its equity capital amounts
to 5 billion euros. The degree of globalization is high; subsidiaries are to be
found everywhere from Portugal to Thailand, Brazil to Poland, and Mexico
to Hong Kong.
Here are some of the enterprise’s self-declared (open) secrets of success:
•Not profit, but human beings take centre stage here. Co-property and co-
determination of all are an expression of this philosophy. Some 45

percent of the employees are women.
•Reinvestment of practically all earned revenue. (There are no
shareholders.)
•Creation of effective instruments of mutual cooperation; at Mondragón
people are not even laid off in times of crisis – although this has changed
since the 2008 crisis. Profits saved up in the solidarity fund are used to
strengthen floundering operations in the group. In addition the
cooperative bank grants loans to prospering cooperatives at higher
interest rates while asking very low interest rates or no interest at all
from cooperatives that find themselves in a difficult situation.
The last point shows how systematic cooperation between enterprises could
work. At Mondragón this basic principle of the Economy for the Common
Good is already an established practice. For David Schweickart, a professor
of philosophy from Chicago, Mondragón was the source of inspiration for
developing an  alternative business model which he  calls “economic
democracy”.

As  Karl  Marx wrote, “[Men’s]  social being ...  determines
their consciousness.”

## 2. SEKEM – ORGANIC FARMING IN THE DESERT
## (EGYPT)
Sekem is an Egyptian fair-trade cooperative 60 kilometres south of Cairo
which was  founded in  1977 and  has  now  evolved into  seven  enterprises
with a total of 1,850 employees.
## 5
Sekem brought organic farming to the
desert and made it thrive there, producing organic foods and health products
along with ecological textiles. Sekem means “vital energy from the sun”.
Founder Ibrahim  Abouleish was  awarded the  Alternative Nobel Prize in
2003 for his “business model for the 21st century which integrated business
success and  the  social and  cultural development of  society through an
economy of love”.
One of the seven enterprises is the phytopharmaceutical enterprise Atos,
which produces natural remedies for the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular
diseases, skin diseases and rheumatism; Isis produces organic grains, rice,
vegetables, noodles, honey, jams, dates, herbs, spices, teas and fruit juices;

Libra is  an  organic farm operation which has  developed biodynamic
processes for producing cotton, oilseeds and grain on cooperative farms all
over Egypt; Lotus dries herbs; Hator markets fresh fruits; Mizan reproduces
seeds for  vegetable farmers;  and Conytex-Naturetex manufactures
ecological textiles. Research for  all  the  enterprises is  conducted at  the
interdisciplinary Sekem Academy for Applied Art and Science.
In addition to biodynamic agriculture, another focus of the enterprise is
fair trade. In the beginning the fair-trade principle was restricted to trade
with  industrial countries, but  now  Sekem is  attempting to  establish this
principle in Egypt’s domestic market as well. The third focus is the well-
being of the group’s 1,850 employees. Kindergartens, Steiner schools and
clinics are funded from their earnings. A free university opened its gates in
## September 2009.
The  employees from all  enterprises gather together every morning to
express appreciation for the work of the previous day and to greet the new
one. The  cooperative’s  central  values –  human dignity,  equality and
democracy –  are  cultivated by  the  Sekem employees. Its  educational
institutions are committed to promoting “free and clear thinking” as well as
“artistic expression”. The health centres work on the basis of holistic and
natural medicine.
The Abouleish Foundation holds Sekem’s capital; the foundation council
oversees the  vision of  the  cooperative. In  February 2007 the  GLS
Community Bank of Frankfurt and the Tridos Bank acquired a 20 percent
stake in the Sekem Group.
## 3. GÖTTIN DES GLÜCKS (“GODDESS OF FORTUNE”)
## AND CRAFT AID – ECO-FAIR TEXTILES
## (MAURITIUS/AUSTRIA)
Göttin des Glücks (GDG) is the first Austrian eco-fair trade textile label. It
was founded in 2005 by four artists from Bulgaria, Croatia and Austria.
## 6
The aim of  this  fashion enterprise is  to  make everyone happy:
manufacturers, customers and the Earth. The clothing is sewn by Craft Aid
(CA), a trade partner of EZA Fairer Handel, on Mauritius. As a long-term
cooperation partner  of  EZA, Göttin des  Glücks can  make use  of  a
continuous, certified eco-fair production chain; it’s a win–win situation for

all. CA is a fair-trade-certified, non-profit enterprise which was founded in
1982 to  help reintegrate disabled persons into  society by  giving them
employment. Today CA has 180 employees who work in the sugar, flowers
and  clothing sectors, half  of  whom are  people with special needs. All
employees are picked up at their homes in the morning and brought back
after they  finish work. The  nine-hour work day  is  interrupted by  three
breaks, which are  conscientiously  observed. There is  no  overtime; the
employees earn 1.5 times the customary pay for those working in the textile
industry on Mauritius. All employees have health and accident insurance,
and  in  addition each employee  has  a  savings book into  which pension
contributions are paid. Every Monday the firm is visited by a doctor who
offers  medical examinations free  of  charge.  In  addition to  freedom of
expression all employees are given the opportunity to make suggestions for
ways to improve the enterprise.
Profits are donated for charitable purposes and invested in expanding the
enterprise. Something the company is particularly proud of is the GOTS
(Global Organic Textile Standard) certification which it received in 2010
with the support of EZA. This is currently the highest-level global textile
eco seal in existence for this production chain.
## 4. FAIR TRADE – APPRECIATING THE PEOPLE BEHIND
## THE PRODUCTS (58 PRODUCING COUNTRIES)
Fair trade sets a counterpoint to “free trade” and the “low-cost supplier”
principle. It was designed to give those beaten down by the system – small
farmers, artisans and  textile workers –  a  chance on  the  world market.
Adequate prices for their products along with reliable and preferably direct
trade relations strengthen their position on  the  market vis-à-vis global
players and provide an important basis for improving their life situation.
Observance of  social and  ecological criteria plays a  major role  for
cultivation of products and working conditions.
In  Europe, Worldshops –  retail  shops for  fair-trade products –  have
contributed to  propagating the  fair-trade concept. Apart from  serving as
sales points they provide information, raise awareness and  facilitate
encounters with  people from the  products’ countries of  origin. Many
Worldshops employ volunteers; if human beings were so self-serving and

competitive “by nature”, as some claim they are, these shops would all have
to close down.
With the creation of the FAIRTRADE label (founded in the Netherlands
in  1988), commercial market players too,  such as  supermarkets, have
gained controlled access to the concept of fair trade. Since then, sales and
the  product range have grown. Global sales of  FAIRTRADE-certified
products amounted to some 3.4 billion euros in the year 2009. Despite this,
there has been some criticism of FAIRTRADE in recent years, and the audit
and certification process must be put on a transparent and independent basis
in response to this.
## 7
In the Economy for the Common Good, products traded on a fair basis
would be granted privileged status over those traded in unfair ways until,
after a transition period of several years, products produced and traded on a
fair basis would become the only ones found on the shelves of shops and
stores. This could be achieved by a progressive mark-up for custom duties
on  unfairly traded products, for  example; then  the  fairly traded products
would soon become less expensive. The World Trade Organization, which
fosters competition and dumping prices, might declare “discrimination” of
unfairly traded products to be illegal, viewing it as a violation of free trade
laws, but this would be just another reason for rescinding free trade laws
and instead asserting fair and equitable trade regulations in the UN.
## 8
## After
all, protection of human rights, labour laws and the environment cannot be
voluntary.
## 5. SEMCO – “INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY”(BRAZIL)
## SEMCO
## 9
was founded in Brazil in the 1950s, It originally manufactured
centrifuges for the plant oil industry. Today it is active on the world market
for  business services: environmental consultancy,  property management,
real estate consulting, office equipment, and steering wheels. In the areas of
industrial equipment, postal services and  document administration, the
enterprise with over 3,000 employees is a market leader.
What is  remarkable about SEMCO is  its  alternative organizational
model. Hierarchies and pre-defined company organograms do not exist in
the customary form. No value is placed on formalities; instead, priorities lie
in mutual respect, co-determination and co-participation. All employees are

treated equally irrespective of their task, or whether they have a managerial
or an executive function. Every task is invested with meaning, which makes
everyone more motivated and content.
When Ricardo Semler, the son of the founder Antonio Curt Semler, took
charge  of  managing the  business in  the  1980s, he  encountered financial
difficulties so he decided to implement extensive restructuring measures.
The former key objective had been to increase the business’s performance
and production indices. Later the focus was placed on social factors such as
the well-being and motivation of its employees. The basic conviction shared
by  all  is  based  on  a  dynamic  model. Participation of  employees has  a
positive effect on their motivation, and this in turn increases participation.
Embracing this approach, the “persons” at SEMCO (as employees are
called there) developed a new organization chart. Flexible working hours
were introduced in all work units. A rotation model was adopted in various
work units as well, which made for more variety and enabled the business
to replace any absent employees. The employees themselves decide how
much holiday time  they  get,  and  when, as  well  as  how  much  they  earn,
these issues being negotiated on a transparent, decentralized basis.
In the “Survival Manual” (Manual de Sobrevivência), ground rules for
working together  at  SEMCO are  laid  down. Every individual who  joins
SEMCO is encouraged to participate, scrutinize goals and processes and be
creative.
In keeping with the company’s entrepreneurial culture, any person who
wants to take on a managerial position must be accepted by the employees
he or she is to be “in charge of”. Putting pressure on employees, issuing
threats or creating stress are viewed as managerial deficits. Terms such as
“employee” and “co-worker” are avoided. The business prefers to use the
word “person” as the central concept for all those working for SEMCO.
Mutual respect replaces formalities. The  climate is  open for  freedom of
expression concerning ideas and  criticism. Differences of  opinion are
viewed as necessary and healthy.
This form of  industrial democracy increases the  self-reliance of  all
persons involved.  The  profits and  results of  each working unit  are
transparent and accessible to all. Some 15 percent of the profits are paid out
to the workers. Use of a balance sheet rate allows everyone to participate in
the discussion as to how profits should be used.

The  SEMCO  model has  stood the  test.  An  enterprise that  once faced
bankruptcy is  now a  profitable  group with twelve business divisions.
SEMCO is one of the best workplaces in Brazil and in the area of human
resources.
## 10
Ricardo Semler was named Latin-American Businessman of the Year by
the Wall  Street  Journal  in  1990, and  in  1992 he  was  named Brazilian
Businessman of the Year. His first book, Turning the Tables, is the best-
selling non-fiction title  in  Brazil’s  history,  and  has  been translated into
twenty-three languages.
## 11
## 6. COMMUNITY-SUPPORTED AGRICULTURE (USA AND
## WORLDWIDE)
The practice of “community supported agriculture” (CSA), inspired by the
biodynamic agriculture of Rudolf Steiner, started in 1986 in two US farms:
the  CSA Garden at  Great Barrington (Massachusetts) and  the  Temple-
Wilton Community Farm in New Hampshire.
## 12
Its concept is as simple as it
is  ingenious: farms supply the  region with foodstuffs  and  the  region
provides farms with the financial means it needs to operate. The consumers
take responsibility for the production of organic foods by giving a purchase
guarantee for example for a year. In return they are informed on production
processes and exert influence on them. They become a part of the business
organism. This  concept is  rooted  in  the  idea  that  within certain healthy
cycles, nature produces enough  surplus to  nourish the  people of  the
region.
## 13
In  the  1980s, CSA spread throughout many regions of  North
America – mainly in New England and the Northwest, on the Pacific Coast,
in the Upper Midwest and Canada. In 2007, the US census of agriculture
counted almost 13,000 CSA farms. California was in the lead with almost
1,000 practitioners.
## 14
In  Germany,  the  Buschberghof  Demeter farm is
viewed as the nucleus of all community-supported farms in the country.
## 15
Since 1987, the  farm has  strived to  implement a  closed economic cycle
which involves in  the  production process not  only the  agricultural
businesses but  also  the  consumers. Other outstanding examples are  the
Kattendorfer Hof  and  the  CSA Hof  Pente. In  Austria, the  Ochsenherz
Gärtnerhof works together with 200 harvest shareholders. The principle of

mutual responsibility for organic and regional–seasonal production is also
implemented in food coops and box schemes. The CSA farms network in
the UK was launched in late 2013.
## 16
## 7. REGIONALWERT AG – REGIONAL EQUITY CAPITAL
## (GERMANY)
In  2006  the  citizen share company Regionalwert AG  was  founded near
## Freiburg, Germany.
## 17
The five hundred or so shareholders make it possible
for sustainable regional agricultural businesses to be financed. At the time
of writing 1.97 million euros have been raised. The capital made available
in  this  way  is  used by  Regionalwert AG  to  buy  agricultural and  related
businesses, which  are  in  turn  leased to  financially weak entrepreneurs.
Financial investments are made in newly set-up businesses along the entire
value-added chain: training, plant breeding, agrarian production (cultivation
of  land, livestock farming, market gardening, silviculture), processing
(dairying, cheese making, bakeries  ...)  and  sales  (retailing, catering,
gastronomy ...).  As  a  form of  extra-financial “profit” the  shareholders
receive “multi-dimensional wealth” and  added “socio-ecological value”
calculated by means of certain indicators, along with security of supply in
the region.
## 8. ETHICAL BANKS IN GERMANY, SWITZERLAND,
## ITALY, THE NETHERLANDS AND AUSTRIA
Today some banks have already pledged themselves to serve the common
good. The German Gemeinschaftsbank für Leihen und Schenken (GLS)
## 18
is
a cooperative bank which was founded by anthroposophists in 1974. It is
the  first  universal bank in  Germany that  operates according  to  socio-
ecological principles. It finances over 6,500 enterprises and projects in the
areas of free schools and nurseries, regenerative energy, institutions for the
disabled, residences, sustainable building, and life in old age. Loans are not
granted to companies that produce things such as alcohol, nuclear energy,
weapons or tobacco or to those that engage in green gene technology, or in
animal experiments, or that use child labour. All loans granted to enterprises

are  publicized in  the  customer  magazine Bankspiegel.  On  principle, no
loans are resold, nor does the bank engage in any speculative transactions.
In 2013, the bank deposits of the customers amounted to 2.8 billion euros.
The GLS Trust is a part of the bank; it administers foundations and awards
money to  non-profit projects. In  addition to  the  bank’s  main  office  in
Bochum, there are six branches which employ a total of 450 people.
The  first  alternative bank in  Switzerland, which was  also  founded by
anthroposophic circles, is the Freie Gemeinschaftsbank.
## 19
It started out in
Dornach in 1984, moving to Basel in 1999. Its objective is to support non-
profit projects and other initiatives which aim to serve the general public by
granting loans according to  ethical  criteria. Emphasis is  put  on  certified
organic farms, free  schools, kindergartens, training institutions, curative
education and  social therapy,  physicians’ practices, clinics, therapeutics,
trade, commerce, restaurants, ecological projects, regenerative energies, art
schools, artistic initiatives, nursing homes and  community living. The
bank’s  total  assets amount to  some 200  million Swiss francs and  it  has
equity capital amounting to  some 8  million Swiss francs. The  share
certificates of the cooperative are not paid back, nor do they bear interest.
Another ethical bank in  Switzerland is  the  Alternative Bank Schweiz
(ABS) with headquarters in Olten, which was founded in 1990 by 2,600
individuals and enterprises. Today it boasts total assets of almost one billion
euros.
## 20
The ABS also grants loans focused on alternative projects. Another
trademark of  the  ABS is  its  transparency; it  publishes the  names of
borrowers and states the purpose of loans granted to them. Democracy and
equal opportunities for  women  and  men  play  an  important role  in  the
business. The bank has 24,000 customers and 4,400 shareholders.
At the Sparda Banks in Germany and Austria, all account holders are
simultaneously members of  the  cooperative and  thus  co-owners who  are
entitled to vote. The Sparda Bank Munich, an exemplary bank among the
Sparda Banks, has 224,000 owners.
## 21
They elect over 200 representatives
and, in  turn, these elect the  supervisory and  executive boards. The
representatives decide how profits should be distributed. Over the past few
years, real dividends on cooperative capital usually amounted to around five
to six percent. The wage differential for members of the executive board
and employees with average earnings was 6 to 1. For the 660 employees
some 120 different working time models exist. The standard working time –
37.75 hours per week – lies below the collective wage agreement. Parents

of children between the age of one and three receive a childcare allowance
of 150 euros a month. In 2010 Sparda Banks was awarded the prize for
“Germany’s Best Employer” in the category of banks for the fourth time. In
the “Kundenmonitor Deutschland” (a German customer survey), the group
of Sparda Banks ranked first for the seventeenth time. The bank’s assets
now exceed 5 billion euros.
In 1999, Banca Etica was founded in Padova. It is the first Italian bank
entirely dedicated to ethical finance,
## 22
and has more than 37,000 members
who hold 46 million euros in share capital. In its first fifteen years, Banca
Etica has provided more than 23,000 loans to families and social enterprises
in all 20 Italian regions. Some 70 percent of its loans have gone to non-
profit organizations, one third to social enterprises. The staff comprises two
hundred employees. Banca Etica has  another merit: it  initiated the
foundation of FEBEA, the Europen Federation of Ethical and Alternative
Banks and Financiers.
## 23
On the global level, ethical banks have built the
Global Alliance for Banking on Values.
## 24
Both associations could serve as
the  starting point for  an  official European banking federation for  the
common good that enjoys a less rigid degree of regulation than for-profit
and investment banks.
Oikocredit is an international credit organization founded in 1975 which
specializes in  micro and  project  loans in  connection with development
assistance. Some 797 loan projects are  supported in  71  countries
worldwide. The  capital, which benefits a  total  of  17.5  million  people, is
provided by 34,000 investors and organizations from fifteen countries. The
organization is  headquartered in  the  Netherlands. The  Society  for  the
Promotion of  Oikocredit Austria was founded in  1990; Austria’s
contribution of  over 1,950 investors currently has  assets amounting to
almost 20 million euros.
## 25
## 9. JOHN LEWIS – A ROLE MODEL FOR EMPLOYEE
## OWNERSHIP (UK)
The John Lewis Partnership is the largest employee-owned company in the
UK. The partnership’s 69,000 partners own the leading UK retail businesses
Waitrose, John Lewis and Greenbee. All permanent employees are partners.
In  all,  43  John Lewis shops, 332  Waitrose supermarkets, an  online and

catalogue business and other business units turned over a total of almost £7
billion in  2013. The  partnership’s  three strategic goals are  providing
advantages for the partners such as happiness and community, realization of
market potential through use of a sustainability strategy, and “peace of mind
about product sourcing”.
John Lewis Partnership shares are held in trust. The beneficiaries of this
trust are the employees of the company. They share the profit and oversee
management decisions by means of a number of democratic bodies. A very
characteristic feature of the company is its “Constitution”, which lays down
its principles, governance system and rules. Founder John Spedan Lewis,
who signed away his personal ownership rights, wanted to leave some clear
guidelines for  his  successors so  that  the  values that  had  motivated him
would not be eroded with the passage of time. Lewis aimed for a “better
form of  business”, that  is,  one  which is  not  driven by  the  demands of
outside shareholders and which sets high standards of behaviour in many
realms. Thanks to this spirit, the project has managed to maintain and even
improve its competitiveness relative to conventional retailers.
## 26
## 10. GEA, GUGLER*, SONNENTOR, THOMA, ZOTTER –
## PIONEERS IN VARIOUS BRANCHES (AUSTRIA)
GEA with its legendary “Waldviertler” (a type of shoe) is an example of
how one can fly in the face of globalization, location shifting and cheap
production by  manufacturing traditional consumer goods using local
resources and a regional workforce, and coupling production and sales. At
the Waldviertler GmbH and the GEA Heinrich Staudinger GmbH a total of
125 people manufacture shoes and furniture. The minimum monthly net pay
is just under one thousand euros; the maximum salary ratio between top and
bottom earners is  2:1.  Since the  autumn of  2010 the  production sites  at
Waldviertel have  produced more electricity by  means of  their own  solar
collectors than they can use themselves.
gugler*, a communications service provider in the Lower Austrian city
of  Melk, has  a  vision –  making print products completely compostable.
They subscribe to the Cradle to Cradle® principle, which could be adopted
as  one  of  the  “supreme goals” on  the  Economy for  the  Common Good
## Balance Sheet.
## 27
For more than twenty years this family business (with 95

employees) has been taking innovative steps to make media production eco-
friendly.  Awards such as  the  Lower Austrian Wood  Timber Frame
Construction Prize 2000, the Trigos 2004, the WWF Panda Award 2006 and
the  Austrian Sustainability Reporting Award 2008 all  confirm their
comprehensive commitment. This is  also laid  out  in  the  long-term
entrepreneurial strategy: “business conduct mindful of the welfare of human
beings and the Earth”.
The  organic herb processer Sonnentor of  Lower Austria, which was
founded in 1988, also is exploring ways to promote social and ecological
sustainability.
## 28
It  too  looks back  on  a  long list  of  relevant prizes and
awards such as the Neighbouring Business award for the southwestern part
of Lower Austria. Some 153 employees process natural products from 150
farms in the region, exporting them to almost fifty countries. The range of
products includes teas, herbs, salt, coffee and more. The business uses 100
percent recyclable or  compostable packaging materials and  exclusively
green electricity; one  tenth of  their power demand is  covered by  a
photovoltaic installation. No direct emissions are generated at the business
location. Together with the  other three aforementioned enterprises and
several more such as  Rogner Bad  Blumau and  the  Fandler oil  mill,
Sonnentor has  co-authored the  Blumauer Manifest, which  espouses
entrepreneurial responsibility and sustainability.
## 29
At  Goldegg  of  Salzburg,  Erwin Thoma  has  built a  business which
produces timber houses made entirely without the  use  of  glue  or  metal.
These so-called Holz100 houses are already to be found in 25 countries all
over the globe. The wood used by the enterprise is the first to have been
awarded Cradle to Cradle Gold certification.
Riegersburg in Styria, Austria, is the home of Europe’s only 100 percent
organic fair-trade  chocolate factory,  which processes 250  tons  of  cocoa
beans from Nicaragua, Peru, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Costa Rica,
Panama, Bolivia and Brazil annually. Founder Josef Zotter is joined by one
hundred employees who carry out all production steps “from bean to bar” –
roasting, rolling and conching – at one site. Since 2004 only fair-trade beans
and sugar have been used, and since 2006 all ingredients have been organic.
Making chocolate  does not  necessarily entail child labour or  mass
husbandry.

## 11. CECOSESOLA – A MULTI-COOPERATIVE
## (VENEZUELA)
In  the  Venezuelan metropolis  of  Barquisimeto the  employees of  an
undertaker and bus enterprise took over the business after it went bankrupt
and converted it into a cooperative, eliminating its hierarchical structures
and  putting decision-making processes on  a  consensus basis. Four
supermarkets form the core of the cooperative; they are open from Friday to
Sunday and serve as meeting places and cultural centres. Their appeal lies
in their fresh, high-quality goods. Numerous farmers and gardeners deliver
goods to  the  cooperative directly.  The  wages are  50  percent  above the
Venezuelan minimum wage (which  is  already relatively high for  Latin
America) and the prices are consumer-oriented. Ninety-nine percent of the
tasks are performed according to the rotation principle: employees alternate
their roles in  achieving them. In  addition to  the  supermarkets there is  a
health centre for which more than US$ 2million has already been raised,
with the money coming from the company’s own resources, donations and
solidarity events. The buildings are finished. What is missing now is the
expensive medical equipment. The government has offered to pay for this
but the cooperative has rejected the offer so as to preserve its independence.
A collective bank is also being set up which will help finance the health
centre. Cecosesola has about 2,000 direct employees and 50,000 members.
The  supermarkets  are  the  largest  in  the  entire city,  and  the  undertaker
business carries out some ninety burials monthly.
## 12. A SOLIDARITY-BASED ECONOMY (BRAZIL)
In  Brazil an  alternative business sector is  growing: the  solidarity-based
economy. It emerged in response to the crisis of capitalism in the 1980s,
during which unprecedented mass unemployment prevailed, threatening to
throw many people into abject poverty. With the free market incapable of
helping them, they  looked to  self-help and  solidarity instead. Numerous
cooperatives evolved. Today, more than 20,000 businesses exist which have
an overall headcount of over 2 million. The spectrum of businesses ranges
from sugar and  shoe factories to  seamstresses’ cooperatives to  fair-trade
networks. Some businesses are  self-run production enterprises, some are

agrarian cooperatives, and some are informal networks established in poor
quarters and  indigenous communities. Five hundred organizations and
eighty cities have supported the  establishment of  the  solidarity-based
economic sector. The state secretary in charge, Paul Singer, holds the view
that whereas capitalism encourages people to embrace egoism and greed,
the  solidarity-based economy has  just  as  great an  impact in  promoting
solidarity and  a  Common Good orientation. Students who  do  practical
training in solidarity-based businesses are eager to stay there, he reports,
adding that mutual assistance is the backbone of this fragile sector. The first
profits made by a sugar factory run by employees themselves did not end up
in the pockets of anonymous shareholders but rather went to educating the
employees and helping them overcome their illiteracy.
## 13. OPEN SOURCE (GLOBAL)
The Economy for the Common Good relies on knowledge being passed on,
not on it being isolated to serve commercial interests. That this does not
contradict human nature is  illustrated by  the  history of  science, which
consists of  systemic cooperation; insights gathered and  published by  the
individual are immediately put at the disposal of all future researchers. In
the  high-tech sector a  branch of  industry exists which embraces this
principle: the  open-source and  free-software movement. Activists in  this
area agree that private firms should not be permitted to patent computer
software, application programmes and  operating systems, but  that  such
products should be  continuously developed in  an  “open”, cooperative
fashion. This spirit has given birth to a series of free high-tech products
ranging from the Linux operating system and the Firefox web browser to
the Thunderbird mail programme and the online encyclopedia Wikipedia.
Whoever discovers something has  the  honour of  seeing his  or  her
contribution become part of a grander scheme. This is a basic human need;
we  all  want to  make a  meaningful contribution, and  are  glad  to  do  so
without profiting from it.
## 14. “NON-PROFIT” – 170,000 WORKPLACES IN NON-
## PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (AUSTRIA)

Despite stock exchange fever,  despite the  lure  of  25  percent returns on
investment, and despite a flood of glossy business magazines, non-profit
organizations (NPOs) are  nevertheless part  of  daily life.  According to
statistics published by Johns Hopkins University, which has been gathering
figures on the NPO sector in the forty largest countries of the world for the
past fifteen years, NPOs currently employ 31 million people, 20 million of
whom are  paid employees. These NPOs boast revenues of  more than
US$1.3 trillion – half the economic output of Germany – annually.
## 31
In the
USA, the  non-profit sector contributed an  estimated $887 billion to  the
economy in  2012, comprising 5.4  percent of  the  country’s  GDP.
## 32
## The
sector consists of  1.44  million  public charities, private foundations and
other types of non-profit organization, including chambers of commerce,
fraternal organizations and civic leagues. Together, they accounted for 9.2
percent of all wages and salaries in the USA.
## 33
In the UK, the non-profit
sector provides 800,000 jobs, two  thirds of  them full-time. More than
160,000 organizations in  the  most diverse areas –  from education and
culture to environment and village halls bodies – had a combined income of
£39 billion in 2012.
## 34
In Austria just under 2 percent of the added value –
some 5  billion euros –  is  earned in  non-profit-oriented places of
employment. Thus the non-profit sector is larger than each of the following
sectors: agriculture and forestry, fisheries, the food and beverage industry,
the  tobacco industry,  the  paper  and  cardboard industry,  the  printing and
publishing sector, or the vehicle manufacture industry. Some 40 percent of
the 171,000 workplaces are paid full-time.
These numerous examples contradict the widespread misconception that
enterprises which do not pursue profit would not make sense and would not
function properly.
## 15. SATISFACTION OF NEEDS AND VOLUNTEER WORK
## AT NO COST (ANYWHERE, ANYTIME)
It is possible to create meaningful added value not only without pursuit of
profit, but also without money. Many essential needs must be met in our
capitalist environment outside the arena of markets and money. In fact, on
the “free” market many basic needs are ignored (a billion human beings are
starving although the planet provides sufficient food for all). At the same

time, people go  to  great lengths  to  meet artificially generated needs and
even addictions.
The  capitalist economy treats unpaid, voluntary services, in  particular
the extremely valuable work provided by women in the home, as a matter
of course. Such services include child care, nursing care, elderly care and
end-of-life care.  It  thus  seems particularly cynical when people claim
human beings would not perform at all without being driven by competition
and  the  pursuit of  profit. Let  us  remind ourselves of  some of  these
“invisible achievements” which capitalism relies on:
•Mother’s milk is not charged for, and nor are pregnancies or years of
childcare.
•Patient care: when the ill are nursed to health by their partners, they pay
nothing.
•Care of the elderly is most often provided by women, often for no pay.
•End-of-life (hospice) care is done primarily on a volunteer basis.
•Care of the homeless and drug addicts; food distribution to the needy.
•In Austria, if someone has a car accident, they are often brought to
hospital by volunteer rescuers. If this person has lost blood, they will
probably receive some from a completely unknown donor. Not only
milk, but also blood is free of charge.
•If someone must quickly do research for a presentation they might
consult Wikipedia, making use of knowledge put at their disposal by
people from all over the world. And to do so they might use Firefox as
an internet browser, which is completely free of charge and corporate
influence. It might even be that their enterprise decides to switch over to
Linux, the no-cost operating system. These days even high-tech is
sometimes free of charge.
In  2010, 63  million Americans, almost 20  percent of  the  population,
volunteered in the non-profit sector. Their work was valued at $284 billion
at  average private wages.
## 35
In  the  UK, 27  percent of  the  population
volunteers on a regular (monthly) basis, while 44 percent volunteer at least
once a  year.
## 36
In  Germany,  34  percent of  the  population works on  a
volunteer basis a total of 4.6 billion work hours annually – as much as the
working hours clocked up by 3.2 million full-time employees.
## 37

The principle of donation and benevolence (Adam Smith) is universal
and  ineradicable even in  capitalistic societies. The  approach of  the  “gift
economy” proposes extending this  principle to  the  entire economy.
## 38
Perhaps this is the second step to take. The first step would be to renounce
making money as the supreme purpose of business and work, replacing it
with quality of life, nurture, creativity and the common good.

## EIGHT
## PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new
model that makes the existing model obsolete.
## Buckminster Fuller
The movement for an Economy for the Common Good began on 6 October
- The first fifteen enterprises – run by Attac businesspeople – which
worked together with me  in  developing the  first  version of  this  book,
organized a conference entitled “Rethinking Enterprise” in Vienna. Instead
of the anticipated fifty or so guests, over a hundred people showed up, two
thirds of whom were entrepreneurs. They got down to work immediately.
Numerous work groups were set up around a bunch of pioneer companies,
forming the nucleus of a highly complex organizational structure which has
taken shape in subsequent years. This structure is an important part of the
strategy: individuals from diverse realms of society contribute their skills
and  expertise to  help  create the  Economy for  the  Common Good. The
strategy includes various tasks: pioneering enterprises draw up a Common
Good Balance Sheet on a  voluntary  basis; business consultants support
pioneers in  this  initial process;  auditors approve the  Common Good
Balance Sheets; editors continuously revise the template for the Common
Good Balance Sheet based on feedback received; universities incorporate
the Economy for the Common Good model into their curricula and conduct
research into it; speakers spread the idea all over the globe; ambassadors
circulate it in regional associations and political parties, and local chapters
(also known as “energy fields”) pave the way for the change to come at
local levels. The first Association for the Promotion of the Economy for the
Common Good was  founded in  July  2011. By  late  2014, an  additional
fifteen associations had been established at the local and national levels in

Italy,  Switzerland, Germany,  Spain and  Argentina. In  the  meantime,
economic pioneers have been joined by political and cultural trailblazers.
All these elements have evolved naturally, without any master plan. The
first strategy was not developed until the autopoietic “ecosystem” for the
Economy for the Common Good had already taken shape.
## 1
Now, four years
after its  inception, the  structure of  the  international movement can  be
represented on four levels:
1.Pioneer groups: enterprises and organizations (business),
municipalities and regions (politics), as well as schools and universities
(education) begin implementing the ideas.
2.Substantive level: expert teams such as editors, consultants, auditors,
speakers, ambassadors, municipal facilitators and mediators advance the
idea, designing processes and supporting the pioneers.
3.Geographic level: about 100 local chapters (= regional groups) have
sprung up across the globe, everywhere from Finland to Serbia, from
Austria to Chile, and from the UK (with initial activities in Totnes,
London, Cambridge, Oxford, Findhorn) to San Francisco, USA. They
represent the movement at the grassroots level.
4.Legal level: the sixteen associations are in the process of founding an
international association which will fulfil coordination and supportive
functions.
The associations are predominantly member societies but there is also one
research association. Four years after it came into existence, the original
Austrian founding association now has about 500 members. Half of these
are private individuals, while the other half is made up of organizations.
The  association’s  homepage also  lists  four categories of  non-material
supporters. By  late  2014 these included 1,750 businesses, 6,000 private
persons, 60 politicians (from various parties) and 7 municipalities/regions.
## 1. PIONEER GROUPS
Economic pioneers

A core process of the Economy for the Common Good involves pioneer
businesses and organizations which:
•draw up the Common Good Balance Sheet voluntarily;
•help to develop the Common Good Balance Sheet with their experience
and expertise;
•cooperate with and learn from one another;
•disseminate the idea in various regions and the corporate landscape.
During the first year some fifty enterprises compiled the Economy for the
Common Good Balance Sheet as part of a “test run” and were then audited.
Valuable experience in regard to the content of the balance sheet as well as
the process was gathered in this way. On 5 October 2011, one year after the
movement was launched, regional groups of pioneer enterprises addressed
the public in seven cities in  Italy,  Germany and  Austria, introducing the
movement and  announcing the  initial results of  their Common Good
Balance Sheets at  decentralized Common Good Balance Sheet press
conferences. The media response was overwhelming. The German
television broadcaster ZDF, newspapers and magazines such as the German
Spiegel  and the Süddeutsche Zeitung,  Italy’s  prominent newspaper
Repubblica and many more media reported on the event. As was expected,
this set off the next wave of development.
By the end of 2014 the number of Common Good enterprises had grown
to  over 200. In  addition to  three joint press conferences and  the
participation of up to 13 cities and regions, local public relations work had
been stepped up. In Frankfurt, the first press conference featuring medium-
sized companies committed to the Economy for the Common Good project
took place, with participants from three countries.
Enterprises may choose between three levels of membership:
•The Common Good Balance Sheet is drawn up on a trial basis, without
any external pressure (Level 1).
•The Common Good Balance Sheet is drawn up together with other
enterprises in the same peer group. The enterprises evaluate each other
(perform “peer evaluation”) and are “cursorily” reviewed by auditors.

This form of membership is possible for enterprises with a maximum of
50 employees (Level 2).
•The Common Good Balance Sheet is drawn up individually or in a group
with or without consultancy and is then audited externally (Level 3).
Pioneer companies that  draw up  the  Common Good Balance Sheet are
simultaneously called upon to demand a new democratic process that will
lead to a more equitable economic order. Thus their political contribution is
very different from the  support given by  voluntary corporate social
responsibility initiatives. Enterprises which, for various reasons, have not
yet  opted  to  draw up  the  Common Good Balance Sheet (for  example,
because they are waiting for it to become legally binding or wish to meet
the new challenge by taking smaller steps) can set a valuable example by
supporting and implementing Level 1.
Political pioneers
Now that  a  first  wave of  pioneer  enterprises has  embraced the  idea, the
body politic  has  started to  take  a  growing interest in  the  movement too.
Municipalities and  cities are  suffering from the  effects of  globalization,
competition in  attracting businesses, tax  competition and  the  power of
financial markets, to ever-increasing degrees. Thus they identify strongly
with the notion of the Common Good. Municipalities can become Common
Good municipalities through a city council resolution, which enables them
to implement a series of projects. For example:
•They can draw up the Common Good Balance Sheet in city-run
businesses. The cities of Weiz, Graz, Mannheim and Zaragoza have
taken this path. In Weiz this was done in the department of culture, and
in Zaragoza the city’s company for house building.
•They can invite local private enterprises to draw up the Common Good
Balance Sheet and make the results transparent through public files while
rewarding participating businesses with public contracts. The Common
Good enterprises could be honoured by the municipality once a year, and
exemplary services to the common good could be awarded.
•Common Good municipalities could introduce elements of an alternative
financial system, for example establish a branch of the Bank for the

Common Good, participate in a “Regional Common Good stock market”
or introduce a regional complementary currency.
•The first citizen participation process to take place is the development of
the Municipal Common Good Index. This is conceived of as an index for
quality of life which can be used by municipalities as a basis for later
calculating the Common Good Product at the national level. The fifteen
to twenty-five quality-of-life indicators to be included in the Common
Good Index could be compiled via democratic citizen participation
processes, ideally with scientific support.
•The second citizen participation process would be the Municipal
Economic Convention. The task of this body would be to formulate the
ten to twenty key ground rules for conducting business. Procedural
guidelines for holding such a convention have been developed by the
Association for the Promotion of the Common Good Economy with
widespread participation of its members. Furthermore, guidelines for
“municipal monetary conventions” exist: democratic assemblies at the
local level which pursue the goal of creating the foundation for a
democratic monetary constitution.
## 2
•Last but not least, the first established Common Good municipalities
could pursue the foundation of Common Good Regions – political
districts or quarters (such as, possibly, Mühlviertel, The Black Forest,
Grisons, Vinschgau, Apulia, Extremadura, Wales) – which would ideally
incorporate all of the respective region’s municipalities. With the support
of the individual Common Good municipalities, such Common Good
regions could induce the province/county/state to become a “Common
Good Province/County/State”.
The first Common Good municipalities were established in the Vinschgau
region of South Tyrol, Italy, under the coordination of the Terra Institute of
Brixen; Latsch, Schlanders, Mals  and  Laas have all  drawn up  their own
Common Good municipal report. This example has inspired emulation and
attracted visitors –  among them a  delegation from Salzburg’s  state
government, which has  adopted  promotion of  the  Economy for  the
Common Good  as  a  part  of  its  government programme. In  Spain,
representatives of  ten  municipalities and  cities met  in  Madrid in  autumn
2013, among them representatives from the  first  two  official  Common
Good municipalities, Miranda de Azán near Salamanca, and Orendain in

the Basque Country, Spain. The second, nationwide meeting took place in
Seville in late 2014. In Venezuela, a district of the capital city – Chacao –
was the first municipality to draw up a Common Good Balance Sheet. A
group of Economy for the Common Good experts/consultants and activists
is  supporting the  municipality,  facilitating the  establishment of  the
necessary infrastructures. Now that Local Agenda 21, Climate Alliance and
Fair Trade  municipalities exist, Common Good municipalities could
constitute the next integrative step.
Cultural pioneers
Teachers and professors have introduced the Common Good Economy to
educational institutions all by themselves. At an estimated 100 universities,
activities of this kind are being carried out in teaching and research as well
as  in  the  application and  public propagation of  the  Economy for  the
Common Good principle. In  2014, the  German Ministry of  Education
approved two research projects on the Economy for the Common Good.
Three colleges and universities are already considering setting up an MBA
programme focused on the Economy for the Common Good, and a proposal
for such a programme will be submitted to the University of Salzburg in
- The University of Barcelona has submitted a Chair for the Economy
for the Common Good at UNESCO in Paris. I have received awards from
two  Latin American universities,  and  the  lecture course I  gave at  the
University of Graz received the teaching award for the year 2013. Countless
Bachelor‘s, Master’s  and  diploma  theses as  well  as  dissertations devote
themselves to this topic. The same goes for term papers written at schools.
The most wonderful news so far is that the business school of the 22nd
district of Vienna will establish a school branch devoted to the Economy for
the  Common Good called the  “HAK experience” in  the  school year
2015/16. This has all evolved through the initiative of countless educators
and researchers.
## 2. SUBSTANTIVE LEVEL: EXPERT TEAMS
## Editors
The Common Good Balance Sheet is the core of the model. For this reason
many people want to know who decides on the criteria it is based on and

how these criteria are weighted in terms of points.
The Common Good Balance Sheet Editorial Team started out as a group
of  four  who volunteered a  lot  of  time and  energy  to  incorporate the
feedback of  pioneer enterprises, private individuals and  organizations,
continually improving the balance sheet.
By  July  2011 the  Common Good  Balance Sheet had  already been
revised twice on  the  basis of  feedback from pioneers and  committed
citizens. Version 3.0 became the foundation for the Common Good Balance
Sheets drawn up in 2011. It was compiled by almost sixty enterprises.
Version 4.0 followed in 2012, and in 2013, Version 4.1. came along. In
our  opinion, it  will  take  some years before the  Common Good Balance
Sheet is  “finely tuned”, which is  to  say,  precise, representative,
comprehensible and  user-friendly.  Not  until then will  we  call  upon
legislators to create a law which makes the Common Good Balance Sheet
binding.
Until then the editorial team will make ongoing efforts to optimize it.
There is currently one editor in charge of each Common Good indicator,
which means that a total of seventeen editors share the core task. Each of
these is assisted by a small circle of experts and interested private persons,
as  well  as  representatives of  organizations that  participate in  the  further
development of  individual indicators. The  three tasks of  these compact
teams are:  (a)  to  process the  large  amounts of  feedback, (b)  to  actively
research sustainability standards and reports and (c) to continue creatively
developing the indicators on the basis of the information collected.
In 2014 the editorial team renamed itself; it is now called the Matrix
Development Team. This team is coordinated by three individuals devoted
to the functional principles, the content and the propagation of the Matrix.
Business consultants
Some of the Attac businesspeople were entrepreneurial consultants in the
past. Quite  a  few  of  them experienced inner conflicts when  helping
businesses get the better of other businesses through aggressive or egoistic
“counter-petition”, and assisting them to maximize their financial profit at
the cost of everyone else. The Economy for the Common Good solved this
conflict of values. Now the consultants can support businesses in efforts to
help other businesses, protect the environment and do good for society. This
work is more meaningful and gratifying.

The  consultants offer  various support services for  pioneer enterprises.
They can:
•draw up Common Good Reports and Common Good Balance Sheets
(attending to everything from initial information to the auditing process);
•shape developmental processes that feed into the creation of Common
Good businesses by formulating vision statements, developing strategies,
organizational development and empathic leadership;
•give expert advice on special criteria such as sociocracy (Common Good
Indicator C5), Cradle to Cradle (Common Good Indicator E3) or
changing over to an ethical bank (Common Good indicator B1);
•help shape customary consulting fields such as team development,
human resource development and quality management using a Common
Good orientation.
In the future, consultants will be coordinated by an economic association
whose task  will  be  to  incorporate internal networking and  advanced
training, to develop mutual forms of conduct in keeping with the spirit of
cooperation and the values of the Economy for the Common Good, and to
establish standards for consultancy services. In addition, they will organize
seminars which lead to certification in many countries. A further goal will
be  to  ensure Common Good enterprises have access to  trained business
consultants.
In  principle, the  process of  compiling Common Good Balance Sheets
and reports can be executed without any consultant. After all, the movement
does not  want to  create dependencies. All  documents, including the
Common Good Balance Sheet, elucidations on  the  indicators, and  the
template for the Common Good Report, will be freely available and cost-
free for everyone. Efforts are being made to acquire a creative-commons
licence. Depending on their needs and preferences, pioneer enterprises will
be able to draw up a Common Good Balance Sheet individually, in a group,
or with professional assistance.
## Auditors
External audits serve to check the Common Good Reports and reveal the
degree to which the Economy for the Common Good is put into practice in

a company’s daily business affairs. Similar to audits of financial balances
by chartered accountants, Common Good Balance Sheets will be evaluated
by Common Good auditors. Through a well-meaning and factually well-
founded outside perspective, firms’ self-assessments that are overly positive
or excessively critical can be adjusted.
In 2011, 35 businesses that received more than 600 points were audited
externally on  the  basis of  the  reports and  the  Common Good  Balance
Sheets. (Twenty  enterprises with fewer than  600  Common Good  points
were audited by another pioneer enterprise, following the principle of “peer
audit”). This procedure entailed comparing the data provided for the reports
with the specifications made for elucidating the criteria on the Matrix, with
the results being critically but benevolently scrutinized. Via several rounds
of feedback it was possible for firms to submit missing data and complete
their Common Good Report in  this  way.  The  first  auditor (each audit
process was performed by at least two auditors) awarded a certain number
of points for each criterion and issued an audit opinion in the form of the
Matrix. This Matrix was easily comprehensible and designed to serve as a
learning tool.
Since then, the  audit process has  been fine-tuned. In  the  meantime,
audits can be conducted at any time. Audit opinions are valid for two years.
Small enterprises with 50 employees or fewer can opt for peer evaluation.
Depending on  the  size  of  the  business, auditors make visits at  longer or
shorter intervals in order to get as comprehensive a picture as possible by
talking to the entrepreneurs on site and perusing documents.
Auditing services will also be coordinated by the economic association.
The  auditors organize certification processes, advanced trainings and
quality assurance measures. The audit fees are scaled according to the size
of the enterprise. Each auditor receives the same hourly fee and provides
some services on an unpaid basis as well.
To  keep  the  costs for  consultancy and  audits down, we  are  making
efforts to receive funding from the various federal states and other agencies.
Fortunately,  some pledges to  provide funds have already been made in
Austria and  Germany (Hamburg,  Berlin and  Brandenburg). In  the  long
term, it would be desirable if the public sector were to cover the costs of
auditing Common Good Balance Sheets, with the proportion of assistance
increasing progressively in  relation to  the  result of  the  balance  sheet in

question – as quid pro quo for services provided by the enterprise for the
benefit of the common good, so to speak.
Later, quality standards and accreditation for auditors could be placed on
a legal foundation. It is conceivable that there could be a special chamber of
Common Good auditors.
Public speakers
The public’s interest in the Economy for the Common Good is enormous.
Every day  a  number of  enquiries concerning lectures are  made  in  an
increasing number of countries all over the world, including the UK and
USA. All segments of society are taking an interest, including businesses,
municipalities, universities, schools, trade unions, farmers’ associations,
environmental organizations, cultural associations, public institutions and
ministries and governments. The demand for lectures can only be met with
the  assistance of  a  large  pool of  speakers. Twice a  year,  training for
speakers takes place in  Germany,  for  the  moment. The  public  speakers
spread the idea of the Economy for the Common Good in keeping with the
principle of “sowing the seed”.
## Ambassadors
The  speakers are  supported by  prominent ambassadors who  promote the
idea in the public eye, in associations, at institutions and in political parties.
The first ambassadors are Helmut Lind, CEO of the Sparda Bank Munich;
Lisa Muhr, co-founder of the eco-fair fashion label Göttin des Glücks, Hilde
Weckmann of  Märkisches Landbrot in  Berlin, and  Francisco Álvarez, a
journalist and ethical investor from Spain. Noah Schöppel from Augsburg is
the first youth ambassador. After the launch of the book in the UK, USA,
Canada and Australia, we will be looking forward to finding ambassadors
from these countries as well.
## Scientists
Across the world, academics in various disciplines have formed networks
with an aim of researching the Economy for the Common Good as well as
teaching students  about it.  The  first  two  network nodes were  Germany-
Austria-Switzerland and Spain-Latin America. The UNESCO Chair project
in Spain evolved from the latter. At the University of Santiago de Chile, the

“Common Good  Accounting” project is  being launched. In  Vienna, an
International Summer University called “Alternative Economic and
Monetary Systems” took place, with participation by four universities. It
was awarded the Sustainability Award of the City of Vienna in 2014.
A  major  source of  resistance against the  Economy for  the  Common
Good is  the  population’s  deep-seated belief in  the  capitalist  image of
humankind. Many people desire solidarity-based, cooperative behaviour but
believe that  the  majority would not  be  willing or  able  to  embrace this
principle. This belief manifests itself in public discussions time and time
again. And  yet  the  assumptions that  lie  behind the  capitalistic  view of
humankind have, to a great extent, been scientifically disproved. In fact, it
would seem that human beings:
•by nature have an inclination to help and cooperate if they are not raised
to be competitive;
•have a capacity for empathy, are interested in the welfare of others and
take pleasure in it;
•feel the need to be part of a community and wish to make a contribution
to its success.
Moreover it appears that:
•groups in which everyone has a say are more productive than
hierarchically organized teams;
•groups whose members make mutual decisions on how to distribute
profits are more productive than teams in which the bosses or owners
make such decisions alone.
These empirically researched sociological and  scientific studies are  not,
however,  as  well-known as  competing social Darwinist myths. Although
the  latter lack  any  empirical foundation, they  are  deeply rooted in  our
minds. The Economy for the Common Good expert team called Science
and Research will compile the  socio-psychological, game theory,
evolutionary and  neurobiological research results, systematize  them and
then serve up the essence of them in appetizing titbits in order to spread the
word. If  dogmas are  replaced by  scientific insight, the  seeds of  the

Economy for  the  Common Good  planted in  this  way  may  one  day  bear
fruit. This  is  a  task  which can  be  executed by  many people without too
much individual effort.
Another way in which the circle of scientists could take action would be
to  help develop  a  Common Good  Product as  an  alternative to  Gross
Domestic Product. So far this only exists as an idea.
## Consumers
A very simple contribution which people could make immediately consists
of asking businesses they frequent whether or not they have already drawn
up  a  Common Good Balance Sheet, which would provide an  important
foundation for deciding which businesses to support. Some activists have
already done this, and  their efforts have borne fruit. Granted, not  all
businesses follow the motto “The customer is always right” – which is one
reason why the Common Good Balance Sheet is so important – but many
businesses take the feedback given by their customers very seriously. The
goal is to ensure an increasing number of enterprises engage in the process
so that eventually it will be in the best interest of all enterprises to draw up
a  Common Good Balance Sheet.  Ideally,  enquiries about the  Common
Good Balance Sheet would come not only from customers but also from
banks, investors, public authorities and  co-enterprises who select their
business-to-business partners in  accordance with their Common Good
Balance Sheet results.
## 3. GEOGRAPHIC LEVEL: LOCAL CHAPTERS
All  pioneers  and  experts can  work  together in  regional “local chapters”
synergistically to achieve concrete implementation. Local chapters are local
or regional groups which implement the Economy for the Common Good in
municipalities, cities, districts, counties and large regions. By late 2014 the
number of  local chapters in  the  UK,  the  USA, Austria, Italy,  Germany,
Switzerland, the Netherlands, Poland, Mexico and Colombia has risen to
- Committed people can contribute to change anywhere by taking the
initiative to build up a local chapter themselves. Comprehensive guidelines
are available which provide assistance in doing this.
## 3
The activities of local
chapters comprise:

•contacting, accompanying, supporting and motivating pioneers in
business, politics and culture and providing them with expert knowledge
and “transformational energy”;
•carrying out awareness-raising and educational campaigns by staging
public events and offering seminars or coaching sessions;
•conveying “methods of co-action” such as sociocracy, systemic
consensus, nonviolent communication, dialogue, dynamic facilitation
and the Art of Hosting;
•preparing and co-initiating local democratic economic conventions;
•developing individual projects such as the Individual Balance Sheet or a
game based on the Common Good Economy;
•contributing new facets to the overall model and process, such as an
individual balance sheet, a prototype for democratic conventions or a
common good management tool.
## 4. LEGAL LEVEL: INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS
Any group of citizens can become active in support of the Economy for the
Common Good, but once the group reaches a certain size it earns the right
to  send delegates  to  the  international parliament of  the  movement, the
delegates’ assembly. The first international delegates’ assemblies took place
in Innsbruck and Munich in 2013 and 2014. They were attended by some
50 to 60 participants from five core states, along with the Netherlands, the
USA, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and other countries.
## POSITIVE FEEDBACK (REINFORCEMENT
## MECHANISMS)
The overall model of the Economy for the Common Good would unfold in
a  system dynamic similar to  that  of  capitalism. In  capitalism, all  the
professional energy,  creativity and  motivation is  focused on  maximizing
financial results, and  these efforts sustain a  particular economic order
through countless  forms of  positive feedback. The  Economy  for  the
Common Good  would develop a  similar dynamic but  with  the  decisive
difference that return on investment would no longer be the guiding light;

the  new guiding light would be  the  Common Good. Here are  some
examples of predictable “positive feedback”:
•The better the Common Good Balance Sheet of an enterprise, the less
this enterprise would have to pay for a loan from the bank.
•Banks would draw up a Common Good Balance Sheet themselves, and
enterprises that chose these banks as business partners would improve
their own Common Good Balance Sheet by doing so.
•If an enterprise selected its suppliers according to the result of their
Common Good Balance Sheets, their own Common Good Balance Sheet
would thereby improve.
•If enterprises made sure that their products were only sold by enterprises
that had a good Common Good Balance Sheet, their own Common Good
Balance Sheet would improve as well.
•If enterprises cooperated with one another, the Common Good Balance
Sheets of all participants would improve.
•Municipalities and all other public agencies would give preference to
enterprises with good Common Good Balance Sheet results when it
came to awarding public contracts.
•Consumers would ask the businesses they frequented whether they had a
## Common Good Balance Sheet.
•Trade journals would write features on benchmark enterprises with the
best Common Good Balance Sheets.
•Consumer magazines would highlight ethical enterprises.
•Job supplements would highlight ethical performers.
•Quality associations of all kinds would place greater store by Common
Good Balance Sheets and make membership conditional upon a positive
## Common Good Balance Sheet.
•Complementary currency initiatives would make the Common Good
Balance Sheet a prerequisite for membership.
A plethora of synergy and bullwhip effects would be generated. In market
economies there  would be  a  tendency for  pools of  participants  –  the
Common Good Zone – to grow, whereas those who resisted would come
under increasing  pressure and  find  it  hard to  explain themselves. They

would ultimately become so  isolated that  they  would resort to  incentive
mechanisms and run the risk of insolvency – unless they decided to change.
## STRATEGIC NETWORKING
The Economy for the Common Good views itself as one facet in the future
mosaic of  a  sustainable, democratic and  humane society.  Hence it  seeks
cooperation with  supporters of  similar alternative approaches in  order to
shared learning, as well as to draw attention to and strengthen one another.
If  people  approaching approaches such as  solidarity-based economy,
creative commons, economic democracy,  post-growth economy,  shared
value, B  Corps, fair  trade, social business seek each other out  and
strengthen their mutual efforts, there is  a  chance that  the  prevailing
paradigm can be toppled. What is important for the increasing number of
people turning away from mainstream politics in profound disillusionment
is not to have only one alternative, but rather a plenitude of alternatives.
Then everyone could participate in those facets of change that suit his or her
interests, talents, education and inclinations.
Change takes place on all levels and in all areas of societal and cultural
life. Below, a “mosaic of the future” (work in progress), which one might
also call the Second Great Transformation,
## 4
is shown. The Economy for the
Common Good is merely one facet of this.
Most of the initiatives are still only seedlings; as yet, none of them are
“system-relevant”. But if they continue to grow consistently and to generate
positive feedback, they can form the sustainable cultural ecosystem of the
future. It  is,  we  hope, only  a  question of  time  before these alternatives
develop the  appropriate infrastructures for  communication, coordination,
cooperation and perhaps also decision-making processes – that foundations
for the enhancement of the civil society tackle this task. It will not be easy,
but if more and more people concentrate on this task, solutions will present
themselves. This is all a part of an evolution. And if the new alternatives
can learn something from the powerful it is this: cooperation is what counts.

## PAVING THE WAY TO THE CONVENTIONS
On the first birthday of the Economy for the Common Good, those involved
with shaping its overall process agreed on a five-year strategy. One central
long-term goal  is  to  hold  economic conventions in  several countries. At

these conventions the ten to twenty most important ground rules for guiding
the economy should be discussed and negotiated democratically and then
presented to the sovereign people to be acted upon. Possible issues are:
•goals and values of the economy
•Common Good Product
•Common Good Balance Sheet
•a Common Good-oriented financial system
•allowed uses of financial profits
•limitations on income inequality
•limitations on inequality of wealth
•distribution of power in corporations
•secure pensions and “democratic dowry”
•reduction of working hours
•leaves of absence
•a categorical ecological imperative.
These are only proposals. The issues for which rules are needed should be
determined democratically as well; in a genuine democracy, “jurisdiction
over  jurisdiction”  lies  with  the  sovereign people. The  path  to  a  national
convention would begin at the bottom: in the municipalities. This principle
has already been described. A “process design” for how to hold municipal
economic conventions is available.
## 5
Hopefully, valuable experiences can be
gathered from the trailblazers at the municipal level which can be applied to
the large-scale event at the national level. At the municipal level the citizens
could meet once every two months, for example, in order to:
•get to know each other and familiarize themselves with the parameters of
the Economy for the Common Good;
•define the ten to twenty questions;
•conduct research and agree on basic issues;
•discuss matters in detail after conducting in-depth research;
•take votes (systemic consensus);
•reflect on results, celebrate and consult on the next steps to take (for
example, helping other municipalities).

We expect this process to have several effects:
•Many people would realize that the economy does not follow any laws of
nature but rather it follows political rules which can be freely formulated.
•Many people would realize that the rules that currently guide the
economy do not conform to their basic values and goals but instead
contradict them.
•Many people would develop a longing to have a convention held again at
the national level, where the constitution could be reformed – or
rewritten.
•Many people would express an emphatic demand for nationwide
economic conventions.
•Democracy would experience a welcome surge of vitality. The more
widespread the idea of an economic convention became, and the more
municipal conventions were held, the more pressure would consequently
be put on politicians and parliaments to hold such conventions. A federal
convention could be constituted by way of direct elections or delegations
from municipal and regional conventions. One pragmatic approach
might be to establish a federal convention after at least 100
municipalities had held local conventions and nominated delegates for
the federal body.
## HOW CAN I PARTICIPATE?
Over the past years I have met a multitude of people who perceive iniquity
in the world but have no idea how they could contribute to doing something
about it.  The  Economy for  the  Common Good offers  a  plenitude of
possibilities for participation. Individuals can:
•found a regional local chapter or support one which already exists;
•adopt one of the fifteen roles which each local chapter consists of
(consultant, auditor, editor, speaker, ambassador ...) or invent a new role;
•ask businesses they frequent whether they draw up a Common Good
## Balance Sheet;

•encourage the enterprise they work for itself to draw up a Common Good
## Balance Sheet;
•invite the enterprise to learn together with ten to twenty other enterprises
in a local pioneer group;
•propose to their residential community that it becomes a Common Good
community, and suggest to the region they live in that it become a
Common Good region;
•organize a “municipal economic convent” in their residential community,
together with other activists;
•integrate the Economy for the Common Good into their own school,
adult education centre, college or university;
•network their “favourite alternative” – one they have already committed
themselves to – with the Economy for the Common Good, seeking out
synergies and building cooperation.
## IN CONCLUSION
The Economy for the Common Good constitutes a participatory and open
process, seeks out synergies and cooperates with similar approaches such as
the  solidarity-based economy,  the  post-growth economy,  the  global
commons, B Corporations, unconditional basic income, the transition town
movement, the Blue Economy and others.
The  cornerstones  of  the  model  as  summed up  in  Appendix 2  do  not
constitute the demands of the movement but rather food for thought for a
democratic process. The only political demand made by the Economy for
the Common Good movement is that democratic discussions take place and
decisions regarding key elements of the economic order be made in keeping
with the needs, values and priorities of the sovereign people. A convention
process moving from the municipal and regional to the national and then to
the  international  levels could be  a  decisive step  towards putting the
economy and the ground rules which govern it on a democratic foundation.
All  human  beings who desire such a  democratic process are  very
welcome to participate!

## APPENDIX 1
## Frequently Asked Questions
Who would monitor the conduct of businesses in terms of their
contribution to the Common Good?
Government monitoring would not  be  stricter than  it  is  today.  Minimum
standards already exist in  many areas. Public health officers, work
inspectors, auditors, revenue officers and  environmental agencies  already
check to  see  if  businesses are  in  compliance with  the  laws. In  essence,
nothing would change except that such inspections would cease to be so
onerous, since rather than conflicting with the primary goal of the business
–  the  pursuit of  profit –  monitoring would instead promote  it:  that  is,
serving the Common Good.
The Common Good Balance Sheet is a political incentive tool. It would
not be monitored by the government. Enterprises would strive to exceed
legal standards of their own volition because this would bestow on them
advantages and  thus  help  them  survive. If  they  got  their above-standard
performance documented, they could (a) earn Common Good points and
entitlement to government support; (b) win the trust of consumers; and (c)
encourage other enterprises to cooperate with them and buy their goods or
services because it  would be  advantageous to  do  so.  The  system would
finally have the right mechanisms in place!
Maybe it is helpful to compare the Common Good Balance Sheet with
financial balance sheets. Corporations have to draw these up in accordance
with certain legal requirements (commercial codes, International Financial
Reporting Standards) and have them checked externally – by an auditor.
Before this happens, certain internal control mechanisms come into play:
controlling, revision and  compliance. All  in  all,  financial bureaucracy is
extremely complicated and much less useful than Common Good Balance
Sheets. It  involves labelling, billing, accounting, making financial

statements, filing taxes, having  audits done. Day  in,  day  out,  countless
people are concerned with monetary bureaucracy, calculating columns of
numbers without there being any guarantee that this makes any sense. The
aim of the Common Good Balance Sheet is to improve relationships, and
for this reason it serves a fundamental purpose. Like a financial balance
sheet it would be drawn up in the company – ideally by all employees – and
checked (“audited”) externally. That’s it. The government would have to do
nothing besides make it as legally binding as financial balance sheets are
today. And later the government would regulate Common Good auditing
practices in the way the auditing profession is regulated today.
What incentives for drawing up a Common Good Balance Sheet do
enterprises already have?
The  more  than  200  pioneer enterprises that  drew up  a  Common Good
Balance Sheet by late 2014 named the following motivations for engaging
in this process: (1) it gave them a sense of social purpose; (2) they utilized
the Matrix as a fully fledged organizational tool, allowing for a 360-degree
view of  all  entrepreneurial activities, namely one  that  is  not  selectively
ethical but, rather, holistic; (3) the Common Good Balance Sheet gave them
an opportunity to form a platform for cooperation, which in turn enabled
them to  help  and  learn from each other; (4)  doing so  attracted ethical
employees; at pioneer banks the number of unsolicited applications doubled
when it became known that they had drawn up a Common Good Balance
Sheet; (5) doing so attracted ethically oriented customers and clients; (6)
support is  already coming in  from public sources, even from state
governments, and in the near future federal governments will probably start
giving support as well (in Austria, four state governments – Vienna, Styria,
Salzburg  and  Vorarlberg  –  already  promote the  Common Good Balance
Sheet, and in Chile preparations are being made for promoting this practice
at the federal level); (7) when “ethical thrust reversal” occurs on the market
as  a  result of  reversing the  direction which incentives are  to  take, the
competitive disadvantages which currently result from conducting business
ethically will be replaced by advantages, and those who are on board first
will have the “first mover advantage”.
What added value does the Common Good Balance Sheet create which
other corporate social responsibility standards do not?

As described in this book, the Common Good Balance Sheet sees itself as
the first corporate social responsibility instrument of the second generation,
which differs from the first generation in terms of its effectiveness. Why?
Because the  Common Good Balance Sheet (1)  is  legally binding, (2)  is
measurable, (3) is comparable, (4) entails legal benefits or disadvantages
(even the best sustainability reports and ethical performances are of little
use if those who conduct themselves unethically, and are consequently able
to sell their goods and services at lower prices, remain at an advantage).
The Common Good Balance Sheet would be embedded in an alternative
economic model and  constitute  a  holistic-systemic approach; (5)  has  a
manageable scope and is easy to grasp; (6) is wholly transparent and must
be made available to the public; and (7) is audited by an externally assigned
professional (first by the movement, later by a Chamber of Common Good
Auditors). A  second audit would place the  results on  a  more solid
foundation.
Wouldn’t the obligation to draw up a Common Good Balance Sheet
make for overregulation and coercion?
Every law and every form of economy is a form of regulation and coercion.
The laws of the Common Good Economy would not be more regulatory or
coercive than those of other types of economies, in particular the currently
prevailing laws of capitalism. The point is that the current system with all
its compulsions has become second nature to us – in fact so much so that
we are not even aware of it any more. We will not notice how freeing the
change can  be  until these structural fetters are  loosened. Today,  we  are
coerced into presenting a socially prescribed self-image, compelled to be
better than others, and encouraged to outsmart them if we can. Whoever
lacks sufficient qualifications or  has  failed to  embellish their curriculum
vitae with half-truths has  little  chance of  making it  on  the  job  market.
Whoever fails to make more profit than his competitors must fear for the
survival of his enterprise. Whoever has nothing to offer on global markets is
already at  a  fundamental disadvantage. The  constraints of  the  current
system are inhuman and ruinous for many. In the Economy for the Common
Good the system would generate certain gentle constraints, but if we were
motivated by  human sympathy  and  solidarity rather than  by  egoism and
competition, it would not be presumptuous to assume that the majority of

human beings would feel more comfortable under this new “guiding light”
than in the current regime of imposed egoism.
What would happen to enterprises that did not participate?
They would go bankrupt. Companies that insisted on tolerating child labour
in their supply chain, polluting the environment, transferring profits to tax
havens, creating miserable working conditions and  generating  extreme
wage differentials  would have very  poor scores on  their Common  Good
Balance Sheet. As a result, they would end up in the highest tax bracket,
have the worst customs classification and the highest interest rates. In turn,
their products and services would no longer be competitive. Seen from this
perspective, the  Economy for  the  Common Good would be  a  genuine
market economy.
Is there such a thing as one (global) morality?
In essence, this is not even relevant, as the Economy for the Common Good
would either grow democratically from below or not evolve at all. Yet the
relational values advocated here are  globally convergent because they
constitute an expression of basic human needs. There is such a thing as an
(unwritten) “global ethos”.
## 1
All major spiritual schools and religions advise
people to help each other, cooperate, be generous and share! Do not unto
others what you would not have them do unto you! This “golden rule” of
ethics is universal. I know of no spiritual school or world religion which
would teach us to be competitive or egoistic. This makes it all the more
amazing that the Western economic system is founded on values that are not
supported by  any  major religion  or  philosophical school. Rather,  social
Darwinism, with its scientifically unsound tenets, is the secret religion of
the world economy!
Don’t we all have our own values?
Regarding some  issues, yes,  but  this  does not  contradict the  collective
values that are laid down in legal norms. Every law constitutes a collective
decision about values because  the  ultimate reason for  permitting or
prohibiting people,  for  encouraging or  dissuading people from doing a
certain thing, is  ethical in  nature.  Speed limits and  no-overtaking zones
serve to  protect human life.  Protection of  private ownership and  the

thousands of  prohibitions, restrictions and  limits that  are  based on  this
principle are ultimately justified on the grounds of individual liberty. Rules
permeate all areas of human life, and every law constitutes the expression
of a collective decision on values which imposes its will on all members of
a democratic community. We are familiar with most of these laws and they
seem self-evident, which is why we often fail to realize that they constitute
collective decisions on  values which punish us  and  deprive us  of  our
freedom if we violate them. The art of democracy consists in achieving the
maximum possible overall measure of  freedom while constraining each
individual’s freedom as little as possible. I have argued that if we had an
Economy for the Common Good, I would expect there to be more freedom
in  total because all  human beings would (a)  enjoy sufficient economic
affluence to lead a good life; (b) be more able to contribute their skills and
talents; (c) get more pleasure out of working and thus find it meaningful;
(d) be more at liberty to cultivate interpersonal relationships in business;
and (e) have their self-esteem bolstered because the adversarial nature of
the workplace would abate and no one would be able to have too much
power over others.
Most human beings have a desire for rules based on values for which a
consensus has been found: solidarity, justice, democracy, equal liberty for
all. Hence the fact that we have laid down laws and enforced constraints
which promote values for which there is no consensus – competition, greed,
avarice, egoism – seems all the more absurd. In the “free” market economy
we are more or less compelled to act egoistically and work against each
other if we want to avoid being condemned to failure and ultimately face
poverty and  exclusion. The  compulsion to  live  according to  values for
which there is no consensual basis – which is something feared by some,
should the Economy for the Common Good be implemented – enslaves us
right now, in the capitalistic market economy.
Isn’t every human being unique, and isn’t capitalism the fairest form of
economy for this reason?
We  are  dealing with a  misunderstanding here. The  Economy  for  the
Common Good welcomes private enterprises and  individual business
initiatives because they are an expression of freedom. Private enterprises
would be  embedded in  a  different set  of  goals, however,  so  that  their
endeavours would augment the freedom of all rather than endanger it.

In  capitalism the  “exceptional” status of  human beings is  very
questionable because it  unfolds within the  framework of  an  externally
dictated set  of  values. Whoever  wins in  the  race  for  money,  power and
success is  “unique”, but  not  particularly happy because these values are
prescribed (“extrinsic”) and not self-imposed (“intrinsic”). For this reason,
not  even successful people truly  feel  free  in  the  current system.
## 2
## The
Economy for the Common Good also has a certain set of values, but one
which, as evidence shows, allow human beings to feel better than they do in
a system based on egoism and competition. By lessening the value assigned
to money, power and competition, while increasing that assigned to other
(“intrinsic”) forms of  self-fulfilment, as  the  Economy for  the  Common
Good advocates, human beings would be  able  to  invest their  lives with
meaning, live  in  harmony with  their individual values, and  follow
autonomously developed life plans. Such uniqueness does more justice to
the  multifaceted potential of  humankind than the  homogeneous
“individuality” of those who win out in capitalism.
Isn‘t competition a part of human nature?
As a possible option for behaviour, yes, but not as a compellingly necessary
type of behaviour. Competition is an option which our genes allow us to
take, but they do not force us to use this option. Similarly, homicide is a
possibility, but not a necessity – there is no genetic compulsion to commit
murder. Our genes merely “condemn” us to adopting a goal orientation.
## 3
What really counts, however, is what we learn. The fact that many people
do  in  fact  behave  in  a  greedy,  selfish and  competition-oriented manner
today merely proves that  the  inhabitants of  the  West  have learned these
values from an early age. Cultures have existed (and some still exist today,
such as  indigenous tribes in  Colombia) in  which cooperation is  the
customary approach. This tells us very little about human nature in general,
but it does tell us a lot about the differences in values and norms between
cultures.
The conclusion to be drawn from all this is: just as we, as a cultural
collective, have learned to engage in competition and act self-interestedly
for  decades, if  not  centuries, we  also  have the  option of  systematically
learning how to practise empathy, cooperation, solidarity and generosity in
the  future.  This  is  possible if  (a)  the  value of  such ethical conduct is
conveyed to us by parents and educators; and (b) we get rewarded for these

forms of behaviour in business. This is what it is all about. If we go to the
trouble of  regulating our  collective conduct using laws, then  we  should
ensure that  these laws guide us  in  the  right direction, namely in  the
direction of human virtues, rather than rewarding us for our weaknesses and
vices.
Aren’t sports proof that competing is fun?
It  looks  like  that  at  first  sight, but  if  you  look  closer a  different picture
emerges. The more it is organized as a game, the more fun sport becomes;
the more it is organized as a competition, the less fun it becomes. Games
are all process-oriented. Those who engage in them can become completely
engrossed and forget themselves. In contrast, competition is marked by goal
orientation. Hence relaxation gives way to stress and pressure. The more we
care  about winning rather than  playing the  game, the  more fear  we  will
experience instead of pleasure. This might explain why 80–90 percent of
fifteen-year-olds in the USA stop going to sports clubs.
## 4
No wonder. If the
winner “takes all” and the others are taunted as “losers”, few will find any
pleasure in the game. Most of the players will merely be subjected to stress
and disparagement. I myself switched from competitive sports to dancing
because the contests were accompanied by too much ambition and negative
feelings. There was too much focus on the goal rather than on the game,
which I love – as an activity. In dance, competition against your partner, as
in tennis, is not feasible. And in love, competition works even less. Would it
make sense to sleep “against” your partner rather than with him or her, with
the objective that whoever reached orgasm first “wins”?!!
Wouldn’t it be better if the Economy for the Common Good were
founded on intrinsic motivation rather than on “incentives”?
Without a doubt. But that could only be a long-term goal as there are not
enough people today who are predominantly guided by intrinsic motivation.
Many have learned to pursue external goals and react to external incentives.
And more important, if we were to allow enterprises to decide how they
wanted to  conduct business today,  some would undoubtedly adopt a
Common Good orientation but others would not, because too many of us
have internalized antisocial values such as  egoism and  competitive
behaviour. And these people would win out because the dynamics of the
currently prevailing system gives the “competitive edge” to the enterprises

with the largest financial profits. This means that the currently existing legal
framework for business would have to be eliminated as well!
Is the time ripe for this? As Aristotle said long ago: “If love would reign
over the world, all laws would be dispensable.” This vision is still valid
today! So long as humankind has not reached this stage, we need binding
rules. The Economy for the Common Good takes a three-way approach:
awareness raising, market-compliant incentives and  binding laws. These
three approaches would mutually guide us to our goal.
But employees do not want to bear any responsibility, do they?
Shouldn’t the employees decide this for themselves? Maybe it really is true
that some would not want to bear responsibility. But perhaps some of them
would. It  makes a  difference whether someone is  not allowed  to bear
responsibility or if the decision is left up to them. The circumstance that
there are currently some people who do not want to bear any responsibility
does not provide any fundamental indication of human nature. Otherwise
the  69,000 proprietors of  John Lewis Partnership would be  an  unnatural
phenomenon, as would the cooperative that has published this book. We are
merely being given a historical snapshot here – some bear responsibility,
take  risks  and  create jobs, while  others “accept” these jobs, bear no
responsibility, and take no risks. And we mustn’t forget that there are also
top managers who do not work for any one corporation for very long, take
hardly any risks and sometimes bear no responsibility at all, while there are
employees who help build an enterprise and then bear the risk of losing
their sole source of income. This risk potentially has a lot more impact than
the risk taken by the manager, which is associated with the loss of capital
invested by a shareholder, particularly if the employee in question has spent
twenty or thirty years of his or her life working for the company and the
decades of  employment there have shaped his  or  her  identity.  In  the
Economy for the Common Good the workplace would be set up so as to
enable the employees of a given company to (a) share responsibility, (b)
make decisions democratically, (c) share risks and (d) divide up the fruits of
their mutual labour.  Enterprises with fewer than 250  employees, for
example, would not be forced to do this but would be rewarded if they did.
According to empirical studies, groups that distribute the fruits of success
amongst all  participants equally are  likely to  perform the  best, because
appreciating everyone equally provides people with the  strongest

motivation.
## 5
Thus one could expect the economy to be more efficient and
productive than it is today! Ultimately, by setting such a course the roles of
“employers” and  “employees” would become blurred and  ultimately
disintegrate. Since  the  opposition of  interests inherent to  capitalism –
capital and  labour –  would be  overcome, the  intra-societal gulf  between
“capital” and “labour” would close.
Don’t cooperation and competition already coexist? Isn’t it a matter of
having a balanced proportion?
As previously discussed, evolution is based on the principle of cooperation
and the capitalistic form of the economy relies on cooperative structures as
well. Families, parents, friends and women do countless hours of unpaid
work globally, without which all the male executives and billionaires of the
world would not  be  raised, loved, cared for,  encouraged, inspired or
appreciated. These are  fundamental forms of  cooperation which are
impeded by economic structures based on competition, structures which are
allegedly a part of human nature and hence allegedly cannot be eliminated.
In the market economy itself, cooperation, teamwork and team spirit are
actually quite common practices, and yet here cooperation acts as a means
to  a  higher goal  –  “counter-petition” and  contra-operation. Thus, in  this
framework the relation between competition and cooperation is out of kilter.
Don‘t legal advantages for those with the highest Common Good
orientation and the elimination of competition contradict each other?
At first glance, yes. And yet the Common Good economy would not stoke
any customary form of win–lose competition. One key strategy for being
successful as  an  enterprise would be  to  help other enterprises –  by
refraining from engaging in aggressive advertising practices, by passing on
knowledge and  orders, by  putting part  of  one’s  own  workforce  at  the
disposal of  others and  by  providing direct financial support.  Besides, a
positive Common Good balance would not  put  a  burden on  other
enterprises; it would benefit them. With structural cooperation of this kind,
there would be no “winners” and no “losers”. We would have a win–win
system. That is the goal. With no positive incentives to conduct business in
a way that promotes the Common Good, what is there to prompt businesses
to develop in the direction desired by society? The only hope is that they
might act on intrinsic motivation, but at present it is simply not sufficient to

rely on this alone. At the opposite extreme, minimum legal standards would
have to be extremely high and binding for all, but this would entail massive
regulatory intervention and ignore the understandable need for a slow and
mutual relearning and  “transformation”. The  Economy for  the  Common
Good provides a practical alternative to the pitfalls of these approaches.
If cooperation were rewarded, wouldn’t this create monopolies at the
cost of the consumers?
This is  an  understandable apprehension given the  logic of  our  current
capitalistic system, which is premised on the assumption that enterprises
would ideally like  to  eradicate all  competition in  order to  milk their
customers for  all  they  are  worth. In  this  environment, cartels  and  secret
agreements are  a  means of  increasing profits. But  the  Economy for  the
Common Good would not  primarily focus on  profits. Moreover,  uses  of
profits that proved detrimental to the Common Good would be restricted, as
would inequality.  For  this  reason, forming cartels as  a  strategy for
increasing profits  would no  longer  make any  sense! Cooperation would
exclusively serve to improve an enterprise’s Common Good Balance Sheet
– and everyone would benefit from this.
What position does the Economy for the Common Good take on the
idea of a basic income guarantee (BIC)?
This is one of the most frequently asked questions, and for this reason I will
give  a  very precise answer to  it.  Let  us  start  with the  essentials. The
Economy for the Common Good is a developmentally open and democratic
process which welcomes all ideas and proposals, incorporating them into
the  model in  an  attempt to  realize overarching goals such as  social
protection, human dignity and liberty. Should the elective sovereign deem
the BIC to be a suitable measure for achieving the goals of its economic
policy,  it  would be  introduced. Inside the  movement a  series of
deliberations have taken place concerning such a proposal:
1.Within the current economic system many people are being
marginalized and an unconditional basic income is to be endorsed as a
way of preserving their dignity.

2.The system dynamics of the Economy for the Common Good would
reverse our priorities, with giving having precedence over taking.
Consequently the market would not be dictated by competition and
scarcity but marked by cooperation and plenitude instead. There would
be enough for everyone.
a.Everyone who wanted to contribute to reaching this goal through
purposeful work would be given the opportunity to do so. Anyone
unable to contribute, or at least unable to contribute as much as the
others, would receive solidarity income.
b.Should unemployment arise, it would be minimized by the fact that
enterprises would be rewarded for hiring more people and
distributing the required workload more equally. All enterprises
would participate in solving the economy’s problems.
3.In the Economy for the Common Good, core working hours would be
reduced to the level desired by the majority of the people, with the
average weekly workload somewhere between 20 and 33 hours per
week. This way more time would be left for the other key areas of work
which round us as human beings, such as cultivating interpersonal
relationships and engaging in community work (according to Frigga
## Haug).
## 6
Through the reduction of the average work time alone,
unemployment in Austria, for example, could be reduced by two thirds,
with the number of job seekers dropping from 300,000 to 100,000.
4.In addition to this, there would be voluntary leaves of absence. Every
tenth year of a person’s work life could be used for a leave of absence,
during which they would receive a temporary BIC, and this would
allow that person to focus on other aspects of his or her life. For this
type of temporary BIC, two main criticisms of the BIC as a permanent
solution would not apply, namely financial infeasibility and resentment
from those not receiving a BIC.
a.If all people took off one year for every ten years of gainful
employment, the pressure on the job market would be reduced by
10 percent. This equals the current rate of unemployment in the EU.
Unemployment benefits could be channelled into financing for
leaves of absence, making the added costs bearable.

b.When debating the pros and cons of this issue, many people go on
the assumption that a large majority of people would pay money
into the system and a minority would take it out again. Irrespective
of whether this fear is justified, it would become irrelevant if leaves
of absence were granted to everyone. Added to which, the
experiences we could gather by implementing this measure might
allow us to gain new insights into life and work – and create a
majority in favour of it.
Would the Economy for the Common Good still be a market economy?
If you try to classify the Economy for the Common Good by assigning it to
one of the following economic systems – (1) subsistence economy, (2) gift
economy, (3) market economy, (4) planned economy – it would fit best into
the  third  category.  It  would constitute a  market economy but  not  of  the
capitalistic kind  we  currently have. Rather,  it  would be  a  “cooperative
market economy”. Private enterprises and “free” markets would still exist
and generate prices, and money would exist too, as a means of exchange.
By  their  very  nature, markets cannot be  defined. Markets are  places of
encounter between people who cultivate economic relations with one
another. The ways in which these people treat each other and the ethical and
legal rules according to which they shape their relations is just as free as the
human spirit, and for this reason such encounters are a matter of democratic
creativity and  self-determination. The  Economy for  the  Common Good
would redefine the  foundations  on  which our  prevalent understanding of
what a market economy should look like is based. The priority would not be
maximization of  self-interest but  rather maximization of  the  Common
Good. Competition would no longer have precedence over cooperation; it
would be the other way around.
Moreover, the Economy for the Common Good would have any number
of “commons” such as energy supply companies, schools, railways, postal
services and banks. These would not subscribe to the logic of the market
but  constitute public goods instead. They would not  be  run  by  the
government, however, but by the population directly. For this reason I have
called them “democratic commons”.
Third, subsistence would be promoted through a long-term reduction of
regular working hours to somewhere between 20 and 33 hours a week. This
would result in  increased appreciation of  other realms of  life  such as

gardening and crafts. The same effect would be achieved by one “year of
absence” out of every ten years of gainful employment for each citizen. The
Economy for the Common Good would not be a subsistence economy, but
elements of subsistence would supplement market activity.
In a similar vein, giving would be promoted in general terms, among
other things through accumulation of value. Generosity and sharing would
become guiding societal values.  If  more people engaged in  processing
goods and  manufacturing essential commodities themselves, they  could
give each other gifts. And there would also be market-compliant incentives
for  enterprises. If  they conducted business in  a  generous manner and
donated resources of all kinds to the community and to other enterprises –
from technology and labour to money – they would be rewarded for this.
Even planning elements could be incorporated into the Economy for the
Common Good.  Enterprises could react to  fluctuations in  supply and
demand in  a  mutual, solidarity-based manner.  The  market  could be
cushioned by a mutually agreed consolidation of supply and demand. This
form of  market regulation would be  decentralized and  participative,
however,  and  it  would be  undertaken by  private enterprises themselves
rather than  by  the  government. Whoever participated in  such measures
would be  rewarded (there would  be  no  coercion, only  incentives). This
would reduce the vulnerability to crisis which marks the capitalistic market
economy.
A “genuine” type of planned economy which functioned without money
and prices because of its strict orientation to needs could be organized in a
decentralized, participative and  democratic fashion. Internet technology
would make this scenario all the more feasible. But such a scenario remains
to  be  implemented. The  notion of  a  “planned economy” continues to  be
associated with central regulation and dictatorship. And yet any Marxist is
aggrieved – and rightly so – when people confuse the reality of the former
USSR with the ideals put forth by Karl Marx: democracy, co-determination
and  human  dignity.  Whoever is  interested in  finding out  more about
sophisticated models of  decentralized, democratic planning economies
should look at Parecon by Michael Albert or the “needs-oriented supply
economy” conceived by Albert Fresin.
## 7
In short, the Economy for the Common Good draws on various models
and all known types of economic system. This is understandable, for none

of  these  is  completely bad  or  entirely good. The  trick  is  to  combine the
advantages and develop them creatively.
Would an Economy for the Common Good be globally competitive?
Within the current free trade regime, no. Free trade would pose a threat to
any “single” Economy for the Common Good. But opening up borders for
goods and services – “free trade” – does not serve any purpose per se. On
the contrary: free trade (already) poses a threat to our liberal constitutional
values and the democratic achievements that are founded on these values:
human rights, labour laws, social security,  health care, environmental
protection and tax equity. If products from countries that fulfil high labour,
environmental and  tax  standards  must enter into  free  competition with
products from countries that violate all of these regulations, we undermine
our  constitutional  values and democratic achievements. Free trade
constitutes a violation of laws and constitutions if traders do not all adhere
to the same preconditions and are unable to agree on a mutual framework
for the market. This is exactly what the Economy for the Common Good is
proposing: free  trade between countries with equal preconditions and
standards coupled with protection from countries with lower standards and
dumping prices. This would serve to protect democratic achievements and
constitutional values.
To  put  it  in  concrete terms, enterprises with a  good Common Good
Balance Sheet would be  allowed to  trade products customs-free, for
example, whereas enterprises with  a  poor  Common Good Balance Sheet
would have to pay quite hefty customs duties.
The EU is the largest and most powerful economic zone in the world,
and could very effectively press for such alternative global trade regulations
if it chose to. Instead, it has joined forces with the USA to push through the
current free  trade agreement, TTIP
## 8
,  an  agreement that  violates human
rights, opposes development and  is  unsustainable. Even if  one  could not
convince all countries to go along with different regulations, the EU could
start with a group of states that was willing to embrace the Common Good
principle and create a Common Good zone. This would be a fair-trade zone
which could agree upon mutually binding social, ecological  and  tax
regulations, including the  two  UN  Covenants on  Human Rights, diverse
environmental and climate protection agreements, and measures to promote
cultural diversity  and  avoid tax  evasion. This  fair-trade zone would also

protect itself against countries in  which such regulations were not  valid.
This is a completely legitimate kind of protection.
Would there be growth in the Economy for the Common Good?
As previously discussed, economic growth would not constitute a goal of
the  Economy for  the  Common  Good per  se,  and  since the  success of
enterprises would no  longer be  measured in  terms of  financial profits,
growth of  monetary values would no  longer be  a  necessary  means of
achieving this goal. Money would be reduced to a means of increasing the
Common Good, and if less of it were necessary to achieve this, that would
hardly constitute a problem. Consequently, one could – it is to be hoped –
anticipate permanent growth of the Common Good – health, education, co-
determination, quality of the environment and relationships, safety, stability,
peace – but not necessarily growth of money, and certainly not growth of
natural and material resource consumption, because efficient use of them
and  their preservation would have become a  part  of  the  new  goal. The
Common Good Balance Sheet of an enterprise would improve to the degree
that it:
•manufactured fewer products of no social value;
•required fewer resources along the entire valued-added chain;
•reduced its environmental footprint in terms of waste;
•returned higher proportions of resources to the resource cycle.
This would generate a steering effect in the direction of resource efficiency,
recycling, reuse, zero emissions and zero waste. Leverage would be applied
–  and  use  of  minimum standards, Common Good points  and  legal
incentives would be  stepped up  –  for  as  long as  it  took  to  reduce
macroeconomic consumption of  resources and  emission of  hazardous
substances to a globally sustainable level.
The Common Good Balance Sheet would not replace all other tools of
environmental policy,  however,  but  rather enhance them. In  addition it
would be necessary to:
•organize a form of global, political resource management which would
limit the extraction of natural resources and distribute them on the basis

of justice and sustainability criteria;
•instigate a radical ecologization of the tax system;
•mainstream sustainability approaches in all delicate policy fields like
agriculture, transport, energy supply, or housing.
Should all measures not suffice, a radical but liberal solution would be the
conversion of the use of nature and the consumption of biological resources
into  a  human right, more precisely,  into  one  of  the  third generation of
human rights (after the first generation of political rights and the second
generation of economic, social and cultural rights). The idea is as follows.
Mother Earth delivers to humanity a certain amount of natural resources
and ecosystem services every year. This regular gift could be divided by the
total number of human beings and allocated as a global per capita resource
budget. In the same way as we successfully coped with the effort to give a
financial price to every product and service on the market, we could add an
“ecological price” that is paid with the individual’s ecological credit card
(reloaded yearly). When the year’s ecological credit has been “spent”, it is
no longer possible to buy things on markets with one’s ecological credit
card. (Of  course, mechanisms would have to  be  implemented to  prevent
anyone starving or freezing to death.)
Within this equal ecological right for all (liberal approach), everybody is
totally free  to  shape her  or  his  individual lifestyle. Scientists have
developed methodologies to measure the ecological impact of every product
and service. Of course, this methodology can and should be improved as it
is essential for the survival for all human beings on this planet and for a
good life for all.
## 9
Oxfam expert Kate Raworth has  developed the  “doughnut model” on
this  issue.
## 10
It  is  a  combination of  two  limitations from the  side  of  the
biosphere. The first limitation, the outer circle, is Mother Earth’s yearly gift
to mankind: the “biological limit”. The inner circle marks what all human
beings need to  consume as  a  minimum to  cover their basic needs: the
“social limit”. The  art  of  an  ecologically efficient economy  resides in
organizing mankind’s  consumption of  natural resourcs and  “ecological
footprint” within these two  limits: to  safeguard simultaneously (social)
human rights and the (ecological) rights of Mother Earth. An innovative
combination of  fundamental rights  and  market mechanisms could be  the
following. The per capita comsumption right to the extent of the inner circle

becomes an  unconditional, non-negotiable and  inalienable human right.
Whereas the amount between the two circles, the actual doughnut, becomes
tradable: thanks to  the  latter,  the  poor could sell  what they  do  not  need
essentially to the rich, and the frugal to the hedonists.
To  better  understand this  idea, it  could be  helpful to  expand the
categorical imperative to  include the  ecological dimension: We  should
choose a  lifestyle that  can  be  chosen by  all  human beings without the
opportunities of  other inhabitants of  the  planet or  those of  future
generations being encroached upon.
The vast majority of scientific research concerning this issue has shown
that reducing consumption of resources and material goods need not lead to
a diminished quality of life or comfort. On the contrary: if rivers, lakes,
forests and fields offered recreational value again; if dwellings required no
oil  or  gas  any  more because they  were well  insulated, made of  natural
materials and  intelligently designed (and  rich  countries stopped warring
over resources); if furniture smelled of natural wood and were pleasant to
the eye and the touch; if food were healthier and provided us with more
energy; if all our essential daily tasks could be performed on foot or using
convenient and comfortable public transport; if we all worked in a stress-
free  environment  which allowed for  relaxation and  enhanced our  self-
esteem; if  poverty and  begging on  the  streets and  in  public places
disappeared because everyone in society and the economic realm had equal
opportunities and rights; if everyone could rest assured that their lifestyle
did not rob those living in other corners of the globe and future generations
of their sustenance, life would simply be better!

## TWENTY-POINT SUMMARY
The “model” for the Economy for the Common Good consists of 20 key
elements. These do  not  constitute any  definite “positions” or  concrete
“demands” but rather inspirations for a broad discussion made fruitful by
other ideas and  alternatives and  conducted in  a  bottom-up democratic
process. Economic conventions could take  place at  the  municipal and
regional level to start with, then at national levels and perhaps at higher

levels after that. The first democratic economic order would evolve as a
result of these activities.
1.The Economy for the Common Good would be based on common
constitutional values: dignity, solidarity, sustainability, justice, and
democracy; as well as values which allow relationships to succeed:
trust, empathy, appreciation, cooperation and sharing. According to
current scientific insights, successful relationships are what make
human beings most happy and are their greatest source of motivation.
2.The overarching goal of business, i.e., the common good, which is
anchored in many constitutions, would be incorporated into the
economic order. The legal framework of incentives for business would
be reversed, with priority being given to pursuit of the common good
and cooperation rather than profit and competition. Enterprises would
be rewarded for mutual support and cooperation.
3.Economic success would no longer be measured by (monetary)
exchange value indicators in terms of means (profit, return on
investment), but rather by (non-monetary) use value indicators in terms
of goals (satisfaction of needs, quality of life, the common good). At the
macro level (of the national economy) the GDP, as a success index,
would be replaced by the Common Good Product. At the meso level
(the level of enterprises) the financial balance sheet would give way to
the Common Good Balance Sheet. At the micro level, the success of
investments would be measured in the ethical instead of financial return
on investment, and applications for loans would be subject to a
Common Good audit.
4.The Common Good Balance Sheet would be the main balance sheet for
all enterprises. The more socially responsible, ecologically friendly,
democratic and solidarity-minded an enterprise was, the better its
Common Good Balance Sheet results would be. The better the Common
Good Balance Sheet results of all enterprises in a national economy
were, the larger its Common Good Product would be.

Enterprises with good Common Good Balance Sheets would have
legal advantages such as lower taxes, lower customs rates, less
expensive loans, preferential status in regard to public purchasing and
research programmes, etc. In this way ethical, environmentally friendly
and regional products and services would become less expensive than
unethically produced ones, and ethical enterprises would assert
themselves on the market.
5.Financial balance sheets would become balance sheets of means.
Financial profits would thus become a means rather than a goal and
serve to help enterprises reach their new goal, this being to contribute to
the common good. As is the case today, it would be permissible to use
financial surpluses for real investments (which did not lessen the
common good), to pay back loans, to accumulate a limited amount of
reserve assets; to pay out a limited amount of profits to employees as
well as to grant interest-free loans to other enterprises. It would not be
permissible to use surpluses for investments on financial markets (these
should cease to exist), for hostile takeovers, for payment of dividends to
persons who were not employed in the enterprise (with the exception of
the founders), or for donations to political parties.
6.Since profits would merely constitute means but not goals, enterprises
could strive to reach an optimal size. They would have no cause to fear
being devoured, nor need to keep growing in order to become bigger,
stronger and more profitable than their competitors.
7.Since enterprises would be able to adopt an optimal size in a relaxed
and anxiety-free manner, there would be many small companies in all
sectors. Since they would no longer want to grow, they would find it
easier to cooperate with other enterprises and practise solidarity. They
would be able to help others out with knowledge, knowhow, orders,
employees and interest-free loans, and they would be rewarded for this
in the form of good Common Good Balance Sheet results. This would
not be at the cost of other enterprises, however, but to their advantage.
Counter-petition would be possible but have disadvantages. Enterprises

would increasingly form a learning community based on solidarity and
the economy would become a win–win system.
8.Income and asset inequality would be limited through democratic
discussion and decision-making processes. The maximum income
would be limited to ten or twenty times the minimum statutory wage,
for example. Private assets could be limited to 10, 20, or 30 million
euros and the right to inherit to 500,000 or 1 million euros per person.
In cases of family assets the limit could be 10 to 20 million euros per
child. Inherited assets exceeding these amounts would be distributed to
all descendants of the following generation in the form of a “democratic
dowry” via a generations fund. The exact limits would be defined
democratically by an economic convention.
9.Corporations exceeding a certain size (for example 250 employees)
would distribute rights to vote and partial assets to their employees and
the general public step by step. If companies wanted to avoid being
progressively democraticized, they could remain smaller. The general
public could be represented by directly elected “regional economic
parliaments”. The governments at different levels should have no access
to or voting rights in public enterprises.
10.The same would hold for the “democratic commons”, this being a third
category of property alongside a majority of (small) private enterprises
and corporations with mixed ownership. “Democratic commons” would
be joint operation companies in the education, healthcare, social
services, mobility, energy and communications sectors. They would
constitute public services.
11.An important “democratic common” would be the Democratic Bank.
Like all enterprises, it would serve the common good, and like all
“democratic commons”, it would be controlled by the democratic
sovereign, not by the government. Its core services would be savings,
low-cost or cost-free current accounts, inexpensive loans, and
participation in regional Common Good stock markets. Nation states
would finance their debts primarily via interest-free loans from the

Central Bank. The Central Bank would be granted a monopoly on the
creation of money, and it would oversee cross-border movement of
capital to prevent tax evasion, among other things. Financial markets in
the present-day form would no longer exist.
12.In keeping with the proposal made by John Maynard Keynes, global
currency cooperation would be established and a global unit of account
would be created for international economic exchange. Regional
currencies could supplement national ones. To provide protection
against unfair trade the EU would establish a Fair Trade Zone (Common
Good Zone) in which the same standards would hold for all or customs
rates could be oriented towards enterprises’ Common Good Balance
Sheet results. The long-term goal would be to establish a global
Common Good Zone on the basis of a UN agreement.
13.Nature would be acknowledged as having an intrinsic value and rights
of its own, which is why it could not be turned into private property.
Whoever required a piece of land to live on, produce things on or use
for agricultural or forestry purposes could be provided with a limited
amount of it cost-free or for a certain usage fee. Provision of such land
would be dependent on ecological regulations and what exactly it was
being used for. This would put an end to landgrabbing, large-scale land
holding and real estate speculation. In return, tax on real estate property
would be eliminated.
14.Economic growth would no longer be a goal; instead, reducing the
ecological footprint of individuals, enterprises and nation states to a
globally sustainable level would be strived for. The categorical
imperative would be expanded to the use of nature. Our freedom to
choose the lifestyle we desire would end where it started encroaching
upon the freedom of other human beings to do the same or simply to
lead a life in conditions fit for human beings. Private persons and
enterprises would be encouraged to measure their ecological footprint
and reduce it to a globally equitable and sustainable level.

15.Time spent on gainful employment could be reduced to somewhere
between 20 to 33 hours weekly on average, as desired by the majority.
This would free up time for three other central areas of work:
relationship and care work (care of children, ill persons and the elderly),
individual work (personality development, art, gardening, leisure) as
well as political and community work. As a result of this more balanced
use of time, our lifestyles would become less consumption-oriented,
more fulfilling and more ecologically sustainable.
16.Every tenth year in a person’s working life could be used to take a
voluntary leave of absence, which would be financed by an
unconditional basic income. During leaves of absence, individuals
could do whatever they desired. This measure could reduce the burden
on the job market by up to 10 percent. This equals the long-term rate of
unemployment in the EU.
17.Representative democracy would be supplemented by direct and
participatory democracy. The sovereign people should be able to write
the constitution, correct its representation, pass its own laws, vote on
international treaties and control areas of basic supply – railways, postal
services, banks. In a genuine democracy the interests of the sovereign
people and its representatives are identical. The prerequisite for this are
comprehensive rights of co-determination and exertion of control by the
sovereign people.
18.All substantive cornerstones of the Common Good Economy should be
subjected to intensive discussion on a broad basis before being
incorporated into a democratic economic convention and compared with
alternatives. The sovereign people would have to vote on the final
alternatives. All proposals accepted by the sovereign people would be
enshrined in the constitution which the sovereign people, and the
sovereign people alone, would have the authority to amend at any time.
To enhance democracy, other conventions could be called for issues
such as education, media, public services and democracy.

19.For individuals to convey and practise the values of the Common Good
from childhood onwards, the educational system would also have to be
placed on a Common Good foundation. This would call for different
types of schools and different curricula, for example understanding
feelings, understanding values, nonviolent communication,
understanding democracy, experience of nature, crafts and bodily
sensitization.
20.In the Common Good Economy, entrepreneurial success would play a
completely different role than it does today and for this reason, different
leadership qualities would be asked for. Enterprises would no longer
seek out the most ruthless, egoistic, rationalizing and “calculating”
managers but rather human beings with a sense of social responsibility,
competence and a capacity for empathy, ones who saw co-determination
as an opportunity and benefit and thought in terms of long-term
sustainability. They would be the new models.
