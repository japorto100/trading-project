## FOREWORD
## By Fran Griffin
In reading this wonderfully brilliant book by my dear late friend and
colleague Sam Francis, I am grateful that Washington Summit Publishers
has  provided a  venue for  a  thorough exposition of  Sam’s  political
philosophy. It is a thoughtful book that repays careful reading. I applaud the
extraordinary efforts of Jerry Woodruff, Bill Regnery, Richard Spencer, F.
Roger Devlin, and  everyone involved in  unearthing and  publishing this
manuscript of  Sam’s. And  I  commend especially Paul  Gottfried for  his
Afterword, which explains so well Sam’s thinking.
As Dr. Gottfried points out, this tome is far different than the fiery and
spirited columns and editorials that Sam wrote. To add a light note to the
heavy subject matter contained in this book, it is my pleasant task to tell
you  a  little  more  about  Sam— details that  are  not  in  his  standard
biographical sketch.
I was a close friend of Sam’s for some 30 years. During that time, my
organization, Griffin Internet Syndicate, was his syndicator (in between his
stints with Tribune Media and Creators Syndicate). Also, I helped to arrange
for  the  Fitzgerald Griffin  Foundation to  publish the  first  posthumous
collection of his work, Shots Fired: Sam Francis on America’s Culture War
—a collection of his columns, articles, and speeches.
I didn’t know him when he was in high school, but even at that time, his
writing ability had already been discovered. He won awards for poems and
essays as  a  teenager.  Later  Sam  became a  serious scholar with  two

advanced degrees in modern British history. But also—as his close friends
know—he had a mirthful, fun-loving disposition. He loved to turn a phrase,
make us laugh, and crack jokes. He had a droll, caustic wit.
Despite the fact that he was an engaging lecturer, a great researcher, and
would have made a wonderful professor, Sam wanted to do what he loved
best—write. His  non-scholarly writing was  delightfully witty and
refreshing. I would be hard-pressed to name anyone who came even close
to being the lively, fun-loving, and enjoyable companion that Sam was. He
was  a  good  dancer,  he  loved  movies and  theatre, and  he  relished good
conversation. He thrived on communicating his often scintillating thoughts
and perceptions. Despite what many saw as a reserved exterior, Sam had a
loving and compassionate side that I was privileged to see and experience.
He was, to those close to him, tender-hearted, warm, and kind.
Joe  Sobran, who  suffered  a  similar  fate  of  being  ostracized for  not
following the  party  line  of  “neoconservatives” and  their  underlings,
described Sam as “Gruffly good-humored, at once cynical and jolly, he was
outspoken and restrained at the same time. His mind was both searching
and skeptical.”
In the accompanying photograph, Sam and I stand with Joe Sobran on
December 4, 2004, in one of the last times I saw him before his untimely
death two months later. We are on a dock, ready to board the Dandy cruise
ship  for  the  annual Sobran’s  newsletter  gathering. Sam  would deliver a
wonderful talk that day titled “Unpatriotic Neoconservatives.” I believe this
was Sam’s last speech.

Sam  was  a  genteel, cultured man  of  the  South. He  had  a  classical
education, being schooled in both Latin and Greek. His heart was always
partly in Chattanooga, where he grew up, and visiting there for his funeral I
could see why. People in his home town are hospitable, kind, generous,
warm, and very Southern, just like Sam himself.
May  this  book  bring  his  unique  and  groundbreaking thoughts  to  the
prominence they deserve.

## INTRODUCTION
OceanofPDF.com

## By Jerry Woodruff
The decision to publish this posthumously discovered draft manuscript
by  Samuel Francis was  made  only  after  considerable reflection and
consultation with others, including Sam’s family. The decision did not come
without reservations. But  these  were  ultimately outweighed by  the
continuing relevance of  Sam’s  political thinking and  his  significant
influence on the evolution of the modern American Right. The political
theory  developed in  this  manuscript  is  too  important a  contribution  to
remain unread.
After his death in 2005, Sam’s family generously gave me possession of
Sam’s extensive files, consisting of two full-size filing cabinets, several
portfolios, loose-leaf  binders, and  a  box  of  3.5-inch computer “floppy
disks” from the early 1990s. Sam kept meticulous records, including many
years’ worth of personal and professional correspondence, memos about
conversations, a journal of notes on books he read, and complete copies of
all his published articles, editorials, and newspaper columns.
In one of the portfolios, I discovered several files labeled with chapter
numbers 1 through 15. As I looked through Chapter 1, I remembered having
read it many years ago. Sam had given me copies of Chapters 1 and 2 years
earlier over dinner one evening. He told me that he was working on what he
called a “reformulation” and “updating” of James Burnham’s theory of the
managerial revolution. I remember discussing it with him, but as time went
by, I forgot about the chapters, and Sam did not mention them again. Much
to my surprise, this portfolio appeared to contain the completed manuscript

of that project. Examining the box of floppy disks, I discovered one labeled
in Sam’s handwriting, “Leviathan and Its Enemies Complete.” It was dated
“3-27-95” and contained Word Perfect 5.1 text files that would become the
contents of this book.
Readers familiar with Sam’s intellectual journey know that he was very
much influenced by Burnham and other political theorists Burnham dubbed
the  “Machiavellians,” including  Gaetano Mosca  and  Vilfredo Pareto.
According to Sam, the designation meant that these were thinkers who, like
## Machiavelli,
were concerned with the problems of political power—not with how to justify power, nor
with the external forms and appearances of power, but with how men actually use, pursue,
attain, and lose power.
Sam was a thorough-going materialist and agreed with Burnham that
rational social and political analysis of the behavior of elites could yield a
“science of power” and expose the workings of history.
I  believe this  manuscript partly  grew  out  of  a  desire to  correct an
intellectual deficiency Sam perceived on the Right. I remember discussing
with Sam many times the American Right’s apparent lack of curiosity about
the socio-historical nature of its political circumstances. No one ever seems
to wonder or explore why the Left is ascendant culturally and politically,
while the Right (or at least the real Right) is consigned to the powerless
fringe. The Right lacks a pathology to explain the power of its opponents—
and shows no interest in finding one.
Thanks partly to Marxism, whose ideological permutations are legion,
the Left has assembled a vast array of social and economic critiques that are
the foundation for its political strategies. Organizations on the Left typically
are founded with missions whose operating strategies are based on critiques

of  socio-economic power relationships and  perceived weaknesses or
injustices in  society.  The  old  Students for  a  Democratic Society  of  the
1960s, to  cite  one  example, based its  radical activism to  achieve
“participatory democracy” on an analysis of what its Port Huron Statement
called “the triangular relation of the business, military and political arenas,”
also  known  as  the  military-industrial complex. Although it  was  wildly
wrong to think it could fashion a coalition of students and workers into a
subversive force, SDS determined that “the university [is] a potential base
and agency in a movement of social change,” and it launched campaigns
that  did,  in  fact,  help  turn  the  American university into  an  extremely
effective apparatus working for the Left’s agenda.
## [1]
One searches in vain for any comparable analysis that could provide the
basis  and  rationale for  right-wing  activism. The  Right  has  no  trouble
placing blame for its political predicament, but has no explanation for it.
Differing factions of the Right have blamed “modernity,” the decline of
Christianity, the Jews, international bankers, the Communist conspiracy, the
UN, the news media, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Illuminati,
among many others. But none of the blaming explains why those factors are
triumphant. Sam believed there were historical and social forces at work
that escaped notice on the Right. In 1987, he observed, “The American
Right, for all its intellectual sophistication and political progress, has yet to
come to terms with or make use of the implications of Burnham’s thought.”
As a result, the Right today appears to have no sense of its location on
the  socio-political landscape, no  corresponding reconnaissance of  its
opponents’  strengths and  weaknesses, and  no  knowledge about  how  to
exploit or counter them. Nor does the Right even display much tolerance for
self-criticism, which could provide a meaningful way to improve its tactics

and strategy. Absent an objective analysis of its position relative to other
forces in society, the American Right has no coherent political strategy, and
relies solely on the hope that publishing enough books and articles will
miraculously convert the masses to the Right’s point of view.
Thomas Molnar in The Counter-Revolution also noticed this peculiarity
of the Right. About the reaction to the French Revolution he wrote,
[T]hen, as now, the counter-revolutionary was inclined to hold that truth was to conquer by
simple exposure, by the fact that it was there for all to see and hear, clearly formulated
after refutation of all the false, fallacious, and dishonest counter-arguments.
## [2]
In private, Sam scoffed at the apparently derivative notion popularized
among conservatives by Southern agrarian intellectual Richard Weaver that
“ideas have consequences.” Not ideas, but power is decisive in politics;
who has it, how they got it, and what they do with it. Ideas are merely the
masks that power wears.
Leviathan and Its Enemies represents, perhaps for the first time since
Burnham, a  major  effort  to  fill  this  intellectual void.  By  developing an
understanding of the socio-historical realities facing the American Right,
the possibility emerges of fashioning realistic strategies for political action.
But this is no guidebook for political action or counter-revolution; it is
only a theory.
Following Burnham, Sam believed a new ruling elite emerged in 20th-
century America as  a  result  of  a  revolution in  mass  and  scale  in  the
economy and population that began in the latter part of the 19th century.
The growth of giant corporations, the expansion of government power and
bureaucracy,  and  the  widespread emergence  of  mass  organizations gave
birth to a powerful class of skilled professionals to guide and manage the
vast operations of the means of economic production, which, on a smaller

scale, were once in the hands of private entrepreneurs and their families. As
a result, the old ruling bourgeois elite, along with its political and social
institutions and its view of society and politics, were replaced by a new
“managerial elite,”  with  a  world  outlook that  set  out  to  remake society
according to  its  own  interests,  and  which was  hostile to  any  bourgeois
remnants in conflict with that project.
As Sam described it,
The liquidation of the middle class and its bourgeois cultural order are essential parts of
that [managerial] revolution, which does not consist only in the material dimension . . . It
also consists, in its cultural dimensions, in the delegitimization and eventual extirpation of
bourgeois culture. . .
## [3]
In this theory, the outlook of that managerial system is the ideology of
humanist, cosmopolitan liberalism—what Mosca might describe as  a
political formula—an ideology that  justifies, rationalizes, and  in  Sam’s
theory, “grows out of the structural interests of the elite that espouses it.” At
the heart of the managerial ideology in Sam’s analysis is the continuous
drive for social change that its advocates call “progress,” the disruptions
from  which create the  need  to  expand managerial reach  and  power in
government and society. In his essay “State and Revolution,” he wrote:
As it is presently constituted, the mega-state exists for the purpose of social manipulation.
Its elite, trained in the techniques of social engineering and social therapy, gains power and
budgetary resources by  inventing social  problems and  crises, and  then  designing and
applying solutions for them.
## [4]
By  defining social  and  economic  life  as  a  series  of  mere  technical
problems, the elite “is able to locate new opportunities for extending its
power” through  the  use  of  its  managerial skills  in  communications and
public relations, social manipulation, economic distribution, and
commercial regulation. In  the  early  20th  century,  the  elite  identified
unemployment, labor disputes, and the existence of slums as problems that

needed solving by government action. Later in the century, the increasingly
powerful elite  discovered additional social and  cultural problematic
phenomena such as
crime, drugs, family breakdown, racism, homophobia, sexism, sexual harassment,
illiteracy,  homelessness, child  abuse, spouse abuse, environmental abuse, AIDS,  gun
ownership, smoking, junk food, alcohol, date rape, Eurocentrism, etc., for which it has a
bottomless supply of science, therapies, and technologies from which it can expect to gain
even more power.
## [5]
To  overcome  and  undermine the  customs and  values of  the  old
bourgeois elite  that  were  seen  to  be  backward and  “reactionary”
obstructions to this new cosmopolitan ideology of humanist progress and
social change, the managerial ruling class allied itself with America’s urban
Black  underclass and  other  groups outside the  traditional U.S.  cultural
mainstream, such as homosexuals and Hispanic immigrants, “to dislodge
rival  elites  in  private, social  and  local  institutions and  jurisdictions and
exploit the middle class.” Multiculturalism, the cult of diversity, affirmative
action, forced school busing for “racial balance,” “homosexual marriage,”
and especially mass immigration provided America’s new ruling class with
what Sam described as “unglimpsed vistas of social manipulation in the
form  of  new  opportunities for  managing civil  rights, ethnic conflicts,
education, health, housing, welfare, social therapy, and assimilation itself. .
## .
Government elites thus anticipate using immigration as a new fulcrum of bureaucratic
power . . . that can advance their own agenda of managing social change and displacing
traditional cultural institutions through the care and feeding of immigrants. ‘Hate crime’
laws, racial sensitivity courses, and anti-Western Third World curricula are among the
instruments for imposing a new cosmopolitan cultural hegemony and plowing under Euro-
American patterns of culture.
## [6]
But revolution breeds counter-revolution. In this updating of Burnham’s
managerial revolution, Sam  thought  he  had  identified a  radical “middle
American” social force capable of mounting a serious political challenge to

the  ruling  managerial class  that  was  bent  on  dismantling the  traditional
American cultural and social order.
The  suggestion that  a  middle-American force  of  resistance to  the
managerial elite  might  exist  perhaps came  from  Burnham himself, who
noted  in National Review  in  1969  that  “the  broad  middle mass  of  the
people” who go to work every day “are holding the country together” and
“sustaining the  governing elite,” despite their  own  non-managerial
ideological outlook.
## [7]
He  noted  that  right-leaning political appeals had
some success with this “broad middle mass,” but warned presciently that
“in  their  current flirtation with  blue-collar workers, most  conservative
intellectuals and politicians do not seem to realize that this liaison could be
prolonged only  with  the  blessing of  neo-populist social  and  economic
policies.”
## [8]
Later, in 1976, the findings of sociologist Donald Warren, who coined
the term “Middle American Radicals”—or MARs—brought into focus the
possibility and  identification of  organized political opposition to  the
managerial regime. The MARs voters were suspicious of big government,
big corporations, and left-wing social engineering.
In his Introduction to Revolution from The Middle, Sam wrote,
Middle American Radicals are essentially middle-income, white, often ethnic voters who
see themselves as an exploited and dispossessed group, excluded from meaningful political
participation, threatened by the tax and trade policies of the government, victimized by its
tolerance of crime, immigration and social deviance, and ignored or ridiculed by the major
cultural institutions of the media and education.
## [9]
MARs were the constituency of the insurgent political candidacies of
George Wallace, Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan, and were the reservoir from
which the “Reagan Democrats” emerged who gave the Republican Party
landslide victories in 1980 and 1984. One hears echoes of a MARs revolt in

Donald Trump’s surprising presidential run in 2015-16.
While hopes for dethroning the managerial elites lay with a radicalized
Middle American social force, Sam  had  no  illusions that  success in
elections was enough. In “Message From MARs,” a 1982 essay, he wrote,
“the  New  Right  will  not  be  the  spearhead of  the  Middle  American
Revolution if it is concerned only with politics in a narrow formal sense. It
must go beyond the tactics of electoral coalitions and roll call votes and
develop a strategy for the seizure of real social power,” by which he meant
extending control to  “the  means of  communications, the  means of
production, and  the  instruments of  force.” He  believed this  task  would
entail “a far more radical approach to political conflict.”
## [10]
In “The Secret of the Twentieth Century,” a review of Kevin Phillips’s
The Politics of Rich and Poor, Sam disputed Phillips’s assertion that a post-
Reagan era left-liberal populism might evolve into a coalition of radicalized
middle-class White voters, who could “be brought into the same political
tent with an underclass” of non-White minorities allegedly victimized by a
“Reaganite corporate establishment.” Citing the rise of Al Sharpton, Jesse
Jackson, and David Duke, Sam argued instead that an ethnic identitarian
conflict might be on the horizon.
[T]he emergence of overt racialism is one species of the decomposition and fragmentation
that has been occurring in the United States ever since the unifying bourgeois fabric was
shredded.
But he acknowledged that “since purely racialist movements can appeal
only to members of a given ethnic group, which by itself is a minority, no
such movement, black or white, can take power in the United States merely
by relying on racial rhetoric and ideology.”
## [11]
Success was to be found in a political formulation that could “synthesize

its appeal to group identity (racial or national) through an imagery of ‘us
against them’ with a demand for the redress of economic grievances.” Sam
argued that a “nationalist-socialist program” was the secret key to political
power in the modern era, and was understood by successful politicians from
Adolf Hitler to Franklin Roosevelt.
If there is to be a successful ‘new nationalism’ in the next decade, its leaders will have to
understand the secret of the twentieth century and how to use it, whether the ‘nation’ is that
of Jesse Jackson or George Wallace.
## [12]
At the time Sam worked on the Leviathan manuscript, now more than
20 years ago, there was plenty of evidence of unrest in the heartland. In
addition to the insurgent presidential candidacies of Perot and Buchanan in
the early 1990s, grassroots movements erupted in many states for ballot
initiatives challenging the direction elites were taking the country. They
included curbs on welfare for illegal aliens, limits on taxation, prohibitions
on  racial  preferences and  “homosexual marriage,” and  term  limits  on
politicians. At the same time, a national armed “militia” movement sprang
up in outrage against sledgehammer federal violence against minor political
and religious dissidents in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Texas.
While there was reason for optimism for MAR political expression, it
never achieved self-consciousness as an “us” against “them.” The resistance
organized by one group on one issue developed no solidarity with groups on
other issues. The leaders of the groups were often “Lone Ranger” activists
with  little  or  no  interest—or skill—in building nationwide coalitions.
Sociologist Warren,  basing  his  analysis on  personal interviews with  his
MAR subjects, found at least one significant impediment to solidarity: “the
lower middle class male defines all organizations which demand verbal skill
and  organized political activity as  incompatible with  his  self-image.”
Feminist critic  Sally  Robinson  of  Texas  A&M  University,  referring to

Warren’s  work,  observed that  historic American “rugged individualism”
was a barrier to unified political action by MARs. In Marked Men: White
Masculinity in Crisis, she noted,
[T]he ideal of masculinity prized most by the Middle American Radicals makes it difficult
... for them to mobilize into a group united against individuality and for racial solidarity.
## [13]
Sam  made  no  firm  predictions  about  the  future of  MARs activism,
knowing well the perils of forecasting based on social analysis and wishful
political thinking. C. Wright Mills, one of Burnham’s neo-Marxist critics
admired by the Left, let his fondness for the Soviet Union get the better of
him when he predicted in a 1960 essay that “the Soviets will overtake the
U.S. economy in a mere decade, or at most two.”
## [14]
Nonetheless, the accuracy of Sam’s investigation into the origins and
manifestations of the managerial system he identifies does not depend on a
successful insurgence of  the  hoped-for “radical middle.” The  brilliant
illumination of the nature and ideology of managerial society and its roots
can stand on its own. He knew that the MARs phenomenon was a creation
of its time and circumstances, subject to other historical developments. He
was well aware that America’s impending demographic crisis threatened to
submerge  and  extinguish the  White core  population of  the  country
culturally and  politically through the  mass  immigration of  non-White
peoples, which was engineered by the managerial system.
Readers must  bear  in  mind  that  in  many  ways,  publication of  this
manuscript represents some unfairness to its author, which is the basis of
the reservations mentioned earlier. After all, the author is no longer here to
make any edits, corrections, or even wholesale revisions that might reflect
his changed thinking. The manuscript was apparently completed in 1995,
yet in the 10 years from its completion to his death in 2005, there is no

evidence Sam sought to publish it. Sam himself may have had his own
reservations, but  we  will  never  know.  Maybe the  manuscript was  an
exercise and building block for a future work, even though it shows every
sign of a finished product. It is quite possible he intended to rework and
update the manuscript, for he had mentioned to friends just a few months
before his death that he hoped to begin work on a book about conservatism
and race. Whole sections of this manuscript could easily have become part
of that effort. References to MARs had begun to disappear in his writing
around the turn of the century, and he instead concentrated on developing
“White consciousness.” All  we  know  for  sure  is  that  the  manuscript
published here in raw form represents Sam’s thinking only at the time he
wrote  it,  and  does  not  necessarily represent his  final  thinking. It  is  a
snapshot of the workings of one of the best minds the American Right has
produced in a generation.

## AUTHOR’S PREFACE
This  book  is  an  effort  to  revise  and  reformulate the  theory of  the
managerial revolution as advanced by James Burnham in 1941. It argues
that in the course of the first half of the 20th century, a “new class” of
managers emerged in the economy, government, and culture of the United
States and that this new class or elite adopted an ideology and a set of
policies that reflected its common interest in acquiring and consolidating
national power.  The  emergence  of  this  new  “managerial” elite  led  to  a
protracted political and ideological conflict with the old “bourgeois” elite
that  prevailed in  the  United States between the  Civil  War  and  the
Depression, and  this  conflict underlay most  of  the  issues  on  which the
“Left” and the “Right” in American politics divided between World War I
and the 1980s. At the end of the 20th century, a new social and political
force  unknown to  Burnham, the  “post-bourgeois  proletariat,” may  be
emerging to challenge managerial dominance and to offer a new synthesis
of bourgeois and managerial values and interests.
Burnham’s book excited considerable interest when it was published,
but  its  iconoclastic tone  as  well  as  various conceptual opacities in  the
presentation of  its  thesis  did  not  serve  it  well.  Burnham regarded the
totalitarian or authoritarian regimes of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia
as archetypes of the emerging “managerial society,” and he predicted that
managerialism in the United States would evolve in a similar direction. He
did  not  anticipate that  managerial  dominance in  societies where mass
participation in politics, the economy, and culture was already established
could not easily assume authoritarian forms.
## [1]
This book argues that while
the United States, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union should be seen as

fundamentally managerial, there is an important distinction between them
in the ways in which their respective managerial elites exercise power. In
the “soft” managerial regimes of the United States and Western Europe, the
existence of political democracy, a consumer-driven capitalist economy, and
a mass culture demands forms of elite domination through manipulative
means. In the “hard” managerial regimes, such as those of the National
Socialists and  the  Soviet Communist Party,  the  absence  of  mass
participation at the time managerial elites began to emerge enabled and
perhaps required the new elites to rely on coercive means of domination.
There are obvious differences between the soft and hard models, but the
underlying similarity—which arises  from  a  common reliance on  mass
bureaucratic organizations, the  application of  technology to  social and
political arrangements, and an elite that acquires power and rewards from
bureaucracy and technology—cannot be ignored or denied.
Burnham wrote The Managerial  Revolution as a finale to several years
of intra-Marxist polemics, and his book not only antagonized the Marxist
sympathies of many intellectuals in the 1930s but also carried too much of
the ideological baggage of economic determinism to satisfy non-Marxists.
Burnham regarded the managerial class as sustaining its power primarily
through its  control of  the  means of  production; he  did  not  at  first
sufficiently allow for other organizational bases of managerial power in the
state, and he tended to ignore the possibility of “cultural hegemony” by a
managerial intelligentsia. This book does not argue for the primacy of any
one  mode  of  organizational power over  another.  Neither control of  the
economy nor  of  the  state  nor  of  the  culture by  itself  will  establish its
controlling group as the dominant elite of a society. Control of all these
modes is necessary to establish dominance, and it is argued that, despite
differences and subsidiary conflicts among the managerial groups in each

mode, these groups share sufficient interests, beliefs, and perceptions in
common that it is meaningful to speak of a unified managerial elite, if not a
managerial class.
Burnham later altered the conceptual framework of the theory of the
managerial revolution from a Marxist one to a perspective drawn from what
has come to be known as the “classical elite” theory of Vilfredo Pareto and
## Gaetano Mosca.
## [2]
This revision perhaps did not render his theory any more
palatable to most American social scientists, however, since they found the
classical elite model almost as distasteful and unsatisfactory as the Marxist
model. Nevertheless,  this  book  also  makes use  of  classical elite  theory,
though it does so in conjunction with other sociological perspectives as well
when these seem applicable, and it tries to modify and control all such
schematic frameworks with  concrete historical evidence. While the  first
chapter is necessarily rather skeletal and abstract in presentation because of
the need to establish definitions and categories, later chapters seek to add
some historical flesh to the sociological bones.
One  such  perspective is  that  of  what  Louis Galambos  calls  the
“organizational synthesis,” of  which Burnham himself was  an  early
exponent. Later exponents of the “organizational synthesis” (who include
John Kenneth Galbraith and Alfred D. Chandler Jr., on whose works the
present book relies) share what Galambos calls “the assumption that some
of the most (if not the single most) important changes which have taken
place in modern America have centered around a shift from small-scale,
informal, locally or  regionally oriented groups to  large-scale, national,
formal organizations.”

This book shares that assumption, but it also argues
that these changes did not come about by themselves or in disembodied
forms but because certain groups (elites) perceived them as beneficial to

themselves and pushed them into reality.
The method of this book is not to adduce new information so much as to
organize known information into a new perspective that interprets American
history in the 20th century as a conflict between two different elites based
on two different kinds of organization. The dynamics of that conflict and its
eventual resolution  in  favor  of  the  managerial elite  based on  mass
organizations, rather than the details of the history of the conflict, is the
main subject of the book. “Left” and “Right” are interpreted as labels that
indicate these different elites and the issues over which they contested, but
ideas associated with both the Left as well as the Right have proved useful
in offering interpretations of the major American socio-political conflict of
this century. Today, it is likely that any further conflict between managerial
and bourgeois groups will no longer generate a Left-Right division in the
conventional senses of those terms, but certainly there will be no shortage
of conflict in the United States in the future. By trying to understand the
meaning of the managerial revolution and how that revolution gave birth to
the leviathan regime of fused mass organizations in the state, economy, and
culture of the present, this book may contribute to illuminating the conflicts
of the future.

The Revolution of Mass and Scale
In the last half of the 19th century and the first part of the 20th, Western
Europe and  North America experienced a  profound and  unique
transformation in the dominant structures of their common civilization. This
transformation, comparable in  its  implications to  those  of  the  Neolithic
transition from subsistence hunting to agricultural production, is not yet
complete and probably will not end soon.    Its essential characteristic consists
in the vast and dramatic enlargement of mass and scale in almost all areas
of organized human activity, the growth of mass populations, concentrated
in  huge  urban  conglomerations, working in  large  factories and  offices,
producing, consuming, governing, voting, communicating, and fighting on
scales and in numbers that are unique in history. The principal consequence
of this revolution of mass and scale has been the re-organization of human
communities at  all  levels into  structures radically different from  the
institutions of  earlier civilizations. These new  structures—mass
organizations—today are the dominant (though still not the most common)
forms of social organization in the Western world: in government, in the
form of bureaucratized mass states, whether constitutional or totalitarian; in
the economy, in the form of mass corporations, public agencies, and unions
that direct and regulate production and consumption; in society, in the form
of  mass  churches and  religious movements, mass  universities and
educational institutions, mass media, and mass associations that contain and
discipline the population. The rise and predominance of mass organizations
in the 20th century constitute what Kenneth Boulding in 1953 called the
“organizational revolution”—“the growth in  the  size  and  importance of
organizations of almost all kinds in the past few decades”—and correspond
also to what Pitirim Sorokin called “colossalism” in cultural, ethical, and

aesthetic as well as in social and economic life.
## [4]
The  rearrangement of  human societies within and  under mass
organizations was necessary to contain, discipline, and provide services for
the new mass populations and the exponential growth of social interaction
that  resulted  from  population increases. The  smaller and  more  compact
structures of traditional societies were unable to accommodate the physical,
social, and psychic needs of the new scale of population in the form of
adequate material provisions, labor, education, communication, culture, and
government, and the enlargement of organizational scale was a response to
the impending breakdown of traditional institutions that the vast increases
in  population precipitated.  The  availability of  new  physical and  social
technologies also  made  mass  organizations feasible and  reinforced the
tendencies toward the  further enlargement of  their  scale. Physical
technologies, based on the application of scientific knowledge to natural
resources, made possible new forms of communication and transportation
that facilitated the creation and management of mass organizations, while
new social technologies, based on the application of the social sciences to
human behavior,  also  facilitated the  emergence of  permanent mass
organizations in the form of corporations, unions, and bureaucracies and
their  management  through public finance and  administration,  “scientific
management,” mass public relations, and the uses of psychology, sociology,
political science, and  economics. While the  continuing enlargement of
populations and  their  human resources and  interactions made  a  re-
organization of society necessary, the new organizational technologies made
the re-organization possible and also encouraged the acceleration of the
revolution of mass and scale, initiating a self-sustaining process in which
mass organizations continued to enlarge, expand, and extend their functions
into  activities and  relationships outside themselves. “As  a  population

expands and redistributes itself,” wrote Neil W. Chamberlain in the 1960s,
“it can no longer function effectively under new circumstances by using old
organizational forms.”
The  United  States in  the  third  quarter of  the  20th  century cannot rely  on  the  same
economic and  political structure that  suited  it  a  hundred years  ago.  .  .  .  Business
enterprises, universities, hospitals, labor unions cannot function effectively today with the
same organizational forms that suited their much smaller predecessors of a century ago.
Even without the advancement in knowledge and technology which has occurred in that
time, the pressure of added numbers alone requires modification of functional forms. As an
organization grows, its manner of functioning must take account of that growth or it is
impeded from performing its function, a case of diminishing returns flowing from a fixed
factor. . . . The density of present urban populations . . . has required the organization of
entirely new  systems of  public relief,  public health, sanitation, law  enforcement,  and
education.
## [5]
The  general tendency of  mass  organizations to  continue their
enlargement has brought them into conflict with more compact traditional
organizations and with the ideas, values, and systems of belief associated
with them. The conflict is accentuated in the emergence of new elites within
the new organizations and the rivalry between them and the older elites of
traditional society. As Chamberlain noted,
A change in social organization would require a change in the authority structure, thereby
threatening the allocation of privilege. New functionaries would have to be provided for,
power and  authority to  deal  with  changed situations would have  to  be  redistributed,
virtually necessitating some dilution of existing power and authority and introducing a
revised system of rewards and benefits appropriate to the new organization. No wonder
that for those who are the chief beneficiaries of the existing system, the status quo is
preferred.
## [6]
The  large  scale  and  complexity of  mass  organizations, and  their
dependence on highly technical functions and the skills that perform them,
serve  to  create elites  within them  that  differ  in  composition, structure,
mentality,  and  interests from  those  that  presided over  the  prescriptive
civilizations of Europe prior to the industrial and democratic revolutions of
the 18th century and from those that ruled 19th-century bourgeois Europe
and America. Mass organizations cannot be governed through the personal

skills  and  character,  the  legal  relationships, or  the  status  categories that
sufficed  to  equip  the  elites  of  the  smaller organizations of  earlier eras.
Technical, highly specialized skills and knowledge, acquired through formal
training, are necessary for the control and direction of mass organizations.
“Merit,” the ability to acquire and to use proficiently the skills necessary for
the direction of mass organizations, is the criterion by which entrance to
and ascendancy within the elite are gained. The new elites therefore have no
interest in preserving (and in fact have considerable interest in discrediting
and  abandoning)  other  criteria of  reward and  professional and  social
advancement such as status, kinship, inheritance, or adherence to moral
codes, which were the prevalent criteria in traditional elites. Those persons
who  are  able  to  acquire and  apply  the  technical skills  and  knowledge
necessary for the operation and direction of mass organizations therefore
acquire control over them and displace the older elites that instigated the
organizational expansion. The technically qualified elites of the new mass
organizations thus acquire power, material rewards, and status from their
positions of control, and they possess a common interest in encouraging the
process of  organizational enlargement, maintaining the  enlarged
organizational scale, expanding the role of mass organizations, increasing
reliance on technical skills, and thereby enhancing the range of their own
skills throughout society and the power and rewards that such skills bring.
The conflict between the new elites and the older elites they challenge
occurs not  only  within the  organizations themselves but  also  in  all  the
political, economic, and  social and  cultural activities that  mass
organizations undertake, and the conflict is not restricted to a struggle for
formal political and economic power but involves a contest for social and
cultural power as  well.  The  persistence of  traditional institutions and
systems of belief constrains and impedes the continuing growth of mass

organizations and their operations, and it is imperative for the emerging
elites  to  challenge, discredit, and  erode the  moral, intellectual, and
institutional fabric of traditional society that sustains the older elites and the
systems of beliefs, or ideologies, on which their rule is based. The elites of
mass organizations formulate and seek to impose new ideologies that reflect
their  own  interests and  rationalize the  dominance, functioning, and
continuing enlargement of the structures through which they hold power,
and these new ideologies challenge the ideas and values that reflect and
rationalize the interests of traditional elites. The struggle between the elites
thus  assumes the  form  of  a  conflict between an  older  and  a  newer
civilization, and, as in any conflict between civilizations, it is a protracted
struggle.
In the past, the principal group that resisted the revolution of mass and
scale and the power of the new elite lodged in the mass organizations was
the  bourgeois  elite  that  predominated in  the  late  19th-century Western
world, though the bourgeois elite found allies against mass organization in
the still older remnants of the prescriptive orders of Europe and the United
States, among other places. The bourgeois elite generally depended upon
small scale and relatively non-technical organizations in the economy, state,
and culture and made use of ideologies that legitimized and rationalized the
private, individual, localized, and diversified organizations of the order it
dominated. The structures and functions of mass organizations tend to be
public rather  than  private, collective rather  than  individual, centralized
rather than local, and homogenizing rather than diversified. The conflict
between the new elite of the mass organizations, which, following James
Burnham, may be called the managerial elite, and the old elites of bourgeois
and pre-bourgeois Europe and America is reflected in most of the political
and social conflicts of the Western world in the early 20th century.

The revolution of mass and scale rendered bourgeois and prescriptive
institutions obsolete. The  old  institutions, unable to  contain,  control, or
provide for the new masses of people, the new scale of capital, production,
and consumption, and the social interaction and conflicts that arose from
the enlargement of mass and scale, were either abandoned or adapted, by
their  own  expansion in  scale,  into  mass  organizations. The  process of
enlargement and  adaptation was  initiated by  incumbent bourgeois  or
aristocratic elites, in part because the obsolescence of the traditional scale
of organization was becoming obvious and in part because the implications
of the revolution of mass and scale for the demise of the power and interests
of the incumbent elites were not immediately apparent to them and in fact
originally appeared to  enhance their  power.  In  some  societies (notably
Russia and Germany in the early 20th century), traditional elites did not
sufficiently or consistently adapt their institutions to the revolution of mass
and  scale,  and  they  and  their  social  and  political structures eventually
collapsed under its strain before the challenges of the new elites. In Western
states, where  mass  populations emerged  earlier as  participants  in  the
economy and the political order, the displacement of the incumbent elites
and  the  adaptations  by  their  new  rivals  were  more  complete  and  were
centered on the need to accommodate and discipline the new scale of mass
participation through the economic, political, and cultural functions of the
mass organizations. These functions in Western societies tended to rely on
the encouragement of social change and conflict and their manipulation by
the  elite  through methods appropriate to  the  disciplining of  mass
participation in economy, state, and culture, rather than on coercion and the
avoidance of change and conflict, which remained the preferred disciplines
of traditional elites in Russia and Germany. Mass organizations and their
internal elites in the West thus evolved in ways that sharply differentiated

them from those in Russia and Germany.
Mass organizations have come to predominate in Western society in the
20th  century,  and  the  managerial elites  that  direct and  control them
constitute the elite or dominant minority of the Western world. They are not
the  only  minorities that  possess social and  political power,  however.
Institutional remnants of the bourgeois order and even of the pre-bourgeois
prescriptive order,  and  elements  of  the  elites  associated with  them,  still
exist, still possess some power, and still command the loyalties of many. Yet
the momentum of mass society is such that the institutional remnants of the
earlier social  and  political orders are  everywhere on  the  defensive and
often, in desperate efforts to sustain their legitimacy and influence, imitate
the organizations, style, values, and discourse of mass society. In the latter
part  of  the  20th  century,  new  groups and  social  forces have  developed
within mass  society that  challenge the  predominance of  the  mass
organizations and their managerial elites. Whether these challenges will be
successful depends on whether the managerial elite as a whole is capable of
recognizing and resolving the vulnerabilities and contradictions it exhibits
and  whether  the  challenging forces will  be  capable of  recognizing and
exploiting these  weaknesses to  their  own  advantage. Regardless of  the
success or failure of the challenges, there is certain to be continuing, and
perhaps violent, conflict within the mass society of the West for some time
into the future.
Three kinds of mass organization predominate in contemporary Western
society: the mass corporation in the economy, the mass state in government,
and  the  mass  organizations of  culture and  communication.  The  latter
include not  only  the  media of  mass  communication, one  of  the  most
important instruments by  which the  managerial elite  disciplines and

controls the  mass  population, but  also  all  other  mass  organizations that
disseminate, restrict, or invent information, ideas, and values advertising,
publishing, journalism, film  and  broadcasting, entertainment, religion,
education, and institutions for research and development. Indeed, the mass
organizations of  culture and  communication, which generally lack  the
coercive disciplines of the mass corporation and the mass state, are able to
provide disciplines and control for the mass population primarily through
their use of the devices and techniques of mass communication. All the
mass cultural organizations, then, function as part of the media of mass
communication, and they constitute a necessary element in the power base
of the managerial elite.
Because of  the  immense size,  complexity,  and  technicality of  mass
organizations in all sectors of society, the elites that direct and operate them
must be specially trained in a number of highly skilled fields. In general, the
fields of expertise necessary for the direction of mass organizations consist
of  three  specialties: purely technical or  scientific skills  involving the
application of the physical and social sciences to the economic, political,
and social activities of the mass organizations; verbal and communicational
skills involving the techniques by which information, ideas, and values are
transmitted to  the  mass  population and  within the  elite  itself; and
administrative skills, by  which the  structure and  functioning of  mass
organizations themselves are governed. These three general fields of skills
constitute the  science and  profession of  management, and,  though they
differ according to their specific applications in different sectors of mass
society,  they  share  the  characteristics that  they  are  highly technical and
specialized in content and methods; that they are acquired only by formal
training and experience; that their acquisition depends on a relatively high
degree of personal intelligence and discipline; that moral character, personal

talents, social status, and  legal  right  are  largely  irrelevant to  their
acquisition and  use;  and  that  their  techniques and  skills, with  minor
adaptations, can be applied to any mass organization.
## [7]
Management, then,  is  the  science  of  operating and  directing mass
organizations, including the auxiliary sciences and fields that are necessary
to  their  operation: the  hard  sciences in  general; economics and  its
applications in  business administration;  the  social sciences, especially
psychology, public relations, and communications science; law and public
administration; etc.  Because mass  organizations cannot exist  without
management and because mass society cannot be coordinated without it, it
is appropriate to speak of mass organizations as managerial organizations;
to  speak  of  the  managerial corporation, the  managerial state,  and  the
managerial media or mass organizations of culture and communication; and
to speak of the managerial elite as the elite of mass society, which itself is
managerial society. The elite holds power over mass society through the
managerial regime, which consists of the formal and informal apparatus of
domination in the three integrated sectors of the state, the economy, and the
mass  organizations of  culture and  communication. Although there  are
conflicts among the three sectors of managerial society, and among their
elites, there is also an underlying unity, a common interest and a common
mentality,  a  consensus that  is  often  unspoken or  assumed on  what
constitutes the best interests and common goals of a society or of mankind,
which interests and goals are in fact the perceived interests and goals of the
managerial elite as a whole, expressed in terms of formulas and ideologies
that  rationalize and  universalize  the  special interests of  the  elite  as  the
general interests of the community and the world. In uniting around what it
perceives to be its best interests (economically and politically as well as
culturally) and in rationalizing its interests as the interests of society or

mankind, the managerial elite is behaving like any elite. The elites of the
bourgeois  and  prescriptive orders behaved in  the  same  way,  and  what
remains of  those  older  elites  still  behaves so,  although with  far  less
confidence and credibility.

## Managerial Capitalism
Of the three kinds of mass organization, the managerial corporation is
probably the best understood. Its rise to power in the mass economy was
anticipated by Thorstein Veblen, its arrival was analyzed by Adolf A.  Berle
and Gardiner C.  Means, its history written by Alfred D.  Chandler Jr., its
dynamics in  the  economy explored by  John  Kenneth Galbraith, and  its
social, political, and cultural consequences predicted by James Burnham.
Despite these studies of the managerial corporation and the economy and
society that develop in association with it, the implications and dynamics of
its development and its relationship with similar organizations in the state
and the culture are still not entirely clear.
The managerial corporation began to develop in the mid-to- late 19th
century, originally as a means of mobilizing massive sums of capital for the
construction of railroads in Europe and the United States and later as a
means by which massive production, marketing, and research (among other
activities) were  coordinated and  controlled. The  “basic reason,” writes
Charles P.  Kindleberger, for the legalization and spread of the corporate
form  of  enterprise “was  surely that  the  amounts of  capital required by
railroads, mines, shipping companies, banks and an increasing number of
industrial enterprises were  increasing beyond the  capacity of  informal
markets to provide them.”
## [8]

The rise of the mass corporation, then, was the
direct response to the revolution of mass and scale in the economy; and the
availability of  a  mass  market  and  labor  supply among the  expanding
population led  to  the  evolution  of  new  economic structures for  the
satisfaction of demand and the mass organization of labor and resources.

“The new industrial techniques” of the late 19th century, writes Geoffrey
## Barraclough,
unlike the old, necessitated the creation of large-scale undertakings and the concentration
of the population in vast urban agglomerations. In the steel industry, for example, the
introduction of the blast furnace meant that the small individual enterprise employing ten
or  a  dozen  workmen  quickly became an  anachronism. Furthermore, the  process  of
industrial consolidation was accentuated by the crisis of over-production which was the
sequel of the new techniques and the immediate cause of the “great depression” between
1873 and 1895. The small-scale family businesses, which were typical of the first phase of
industrialism, were in many cases too narrowly based to withstand the depression; nor had
they always the means to finance the installation of new, more complicated and more
expensive machinery.  Hence the  crisis, by  favoring rationalization and  unified
management, was a spur to the large-scale concern and to the formation of trusts and
cartels; and the process of concentration, once begun, was irreversible.
## [9]
The  characteristic that  ordinarily  distinguishes the  mass  corporation
from the entrepreneurial firm (the partnership, family firm, or individual
entrepreneurship) that predominated in the bourgeois economic order of the
19th  century  is  the  dispersion of  ownership of  the  corporation  into  the
hands of the mass of stockholders, whose purchase of stock provides the
capital for the corporation. The dispersion of ownership among a mass of
investors makes possible the mobilization of a scale of capital and a growth
of  production far  beyond what  can  normally be  achieved by  the
entrepreneurial firm.  Moreover,  dispersion of  ownership means that  the
owners themselves cannot operate the corporate enterprise. For most of the
stockholders, their investment in the stock of any corporation is a small part
of their normal business life, and most of them lack the time, opportunity,
and special knowledge required to participate intelligently in the operation
of the corporate firm. Hence, the owners must hire or appoint professional
managers, whose training or experience enables them to conduct corporate
business at all levels.
Both Adam Smith and Karl Marx, contemplating the rudimentary forms
of  corporations of  their  time,  perceived a  natural conflict of  interest

between the owners or stockholders of a corporation and its managers.
## [10]
The  owners are  interested primarily in  a  profitable return on  their
investment, measured in  the  increased yield  of  their  dividend. The
managers, on the other hand, are interested in the wellbeing and particularly
in the growth of the corporation itself, and they typically desire not to pay
out  higher yields to  the  owners but  to  reinvest corporate profits in  an
increased capacity  for  greater output and  enlargement of  facilities and
operations. The goal of corporate growth, the ever increasing expansion of
the mass economic organization, has become embedded in the professional
code  of  modern corporate managers, and  the  goal  corresponds to  their
group  interests. Thus,  as  John  Kenneth Galbraith explains in The  New
Industrial State  (in  which his  term  “technostructure” is  equivalent to
management in a broad sense),
Expansion of output means expansion of the technostructure itself. Such expansion, in
time, means more jobs with more responsibility and hence more compensation. . . . The
paradox of modern economic motivation is that profit maximization as a goal requires that
the individual member of the technostructure subordinate his personal pecuniary interest to
that of the remote and unknown stockholders. By contrast, growth as a goal is wholly
consistent with the personal and pecuniary interest of those who participate in decisions
and direct the enterprise.
## [11]
Alfred D.   Chandler Jr.,  whose  massive history of  the  managerial
revolution in  American business  is  a  definitive study  of  the  subject,
concurs:
For salaried managers the continuing existence of their enterprise was essential to their
lifetime careers. Their  primary goal  was  to  assure continuing use  of  and  therefore
continuing flow of material to their facilities. They were far more willing than were the
owners (the stockholders) to reduce or even forego current dividends in order to maintain
the  long-term  viability  of  their  organizations. They  sought to  protect their  sources of
supply and their outlets. They took on new products and new services in order to make
more complete use of existing facilities and personnel. Such expansion, in turn, led to the
addition of  still  more  workers and  equipment.  If  profits were  high,  they  preferred to
reinvest them in the enterprise rather than to pay them out in dividends. In this way the
desire of the managers to keep the organization fully employed became a continuing force
for its further growth.
## [12]

The managerial elements in the corporation assume effective control of
the corporation from the owners. Although owners retain the legal right to
control the voting power their stock gives, the dispersion of the mass of
owners, who lack the opportunity, the interest, or the ability to coordinate
their voting power, tends to prevent most effective challenges to those who
possess the skills to operate and direct the corporate firm. But the decisive
cause of the loss of control by the stockholders to the managers is the sheer
size, complexity, and technicality of the mass corporation and its activities.
Whatever the legal rights of the owners and however much stock they hold,
they cannot, by virtue of legal right and ownership of stock, acquire and
exercise the  specialized technical skills  that  management of  the  mass
corporation involves. Even  when  an  “owners’  revolt” (the  very  phrase
suggests the legitimacy of managerial authority) occurs and is successful,
the owners must simply hire new managers; without managerial skills, they
cannot undertake management functions themselves.
Nor can “big owners”—persons who own large blocs of stock sufficient
to  place  them  on  the  board  of  a  corporation and  to  make  their  votes
influential in corporate decision-making— perform management functions
unless they  themselves have  acquired managerial skills, which is  rare.
Chandler is very specific on this point:
[M]embers of the entrepreneurial family rarely became active in top management unless
they themselves were trained as professional managers. Since the profits of the family
enterprise usually assured them  of  a  large  personal income, they  had  little  financial
incentive to spend years working up the managerial ladder. Therefore, in only a few of the
large American business enterprises did family members continue to participate for more
than two generations in the management of the companies they owned.
## [13]
Moreover, at the level of the “big owners,” the interests of management
and ownership tend to coalesce. The big owners are already wealthy and are
less concerned with the dividend yield than with the increase in or stability

of the value of their stock. It is the growth of the corporation that increases
or stabilizes the stock value, and thus the big owners are assimilated into
the  same  set  of  interests as  the  managers. “Wealthy families,” writes
Chandler, “are the beneficiaries of managerial capitalism.”
## [14]
The  massive scale, complexity,  and  technicality of  the  modern
corporation thus lead to the “separation of ownership and control.” While
the  owners, large  or  small, retain  the  financial benefits of  managerial
capitalism, the managers acquire control of the assets, plant, production,
policies, and the marketing, financing, and research techniques and methods
that  constitute the  corporation. The  corporate revolution, then,  the
revolution of  mass  and  scale  in  the  economy,  represents not  only  the
replacement of  compact bourgeois  or  entrepreneurial firms  by  mass
corporations as the dominant units of the economy but also what James
Burnham was the first to call “the managerial revolution,” the displacement
of the economic elite of bourgeois capitalism by the new managerial elite of
the mass corporation. The managerial elite, though its individual members
may be tied to or descended from the bourgeois elite, acquires a different
and conflicting power base, and different and conflicting structural interests
and goals, from those of the bourgeois elite, and through the dispersion of
ownership and the separation of ownership and control, the managers are
able to make their interests and goals predominate over those of the owners
or  stockholders. The  petty  bourgeoisie,  from  whose ranks  the  mass  of
stockholders are drawn, have no voice in the direction and control of the
mass  organizations of  the  managerial economy,  while the  grand
bourgeoisie, from whom the big owners are drawn, cease to participate in
and to exercise power over the economy, though they remain dependent on
and beneficiaries of its massive capacities for production and consumption.

Not  only  is  the  managerial elite  in  conflict with  the  interests of  the
dispersed mass of the owners of stock but also the managerial corporation is
in conflict with the entrepreneurial firm. The most obvious source of such
conflict is that the mass corporation has an interest in absorbing or driving
out of business its competitors, and the first competitors to fall are the small
entrepreneurial firms, the size, productivity, and marketing and technical
skills of which cannot compete against those of the massive and technically
sophisticated corporate enterprise. The  mass  economy of  managerial
capitalism is  characteristically oligopolistic,  with  a  concentration of
industry among relatively few large corporations that seek to regulate prices
independently of  the  market. “Classical competition,” writes Robert
## Heilbroner,
implies a situation in which there are so many firms (of roughly the same order of size)
that no one of them by itself can directly influence market prices. . . . In oligopoly, by way
of contrast, the members of firms are few enough (or the disparity in size among the few
large  ones  and  the  host  of  smaller ones  is  so  great)  that  the  large  firms  cannot help
affecting the market situation. . . . As a result, whereas in classical competition, firms must
accept whatever prices the market thrusts upon them, in oligopolistic markets, prices can
be “set,” at least within limits, by the direct action of the leading firms.
## [15]
The  emergence of  a  managerial economy thus  challenges the
sovereignty of the market and the consumer as well as the entrepreneurial
economic structures of the bourgeois order.
The struggle for economic power between the bourgeois and managerial
regimes is  part  of  the  broader  civilizational conflict  between  them  that
appears in  the  managerial challenge to  the  moral  and  social  codes  and
political institutions  associated  with  the  bourgeois  order  and  its  market
economy.  The  interests of  the  managerial elite  lie  in  the  growth and
expansion not only of the mass corporation but also of the mass state and
mass society, the scope of mass organizations in general, and the subversion
of bourgeois and prescriptive institutions that constrain the enlargement and

functioning of  mass  organizations. On  the  political level  this  conflict
concerns the scale, structure, and activities of the state. Mass markets are
essential to  the  mass  corporation, and  these  are  controlled through
advertising on  a  national scale  and  through manipulation of  aggregate
demand. There must  therefore  be  a  close  alliance between  the  mass
corporation, on the one hand, and the mass media of communication and
the mass state, the vehicles of advertising and control of demand, on the
other. The fusion or integration of these sectors of mass society strikes at
the  very  root  of  pre-mass (bourgeois  or  prescriptive) society,  not  only
politically but socially and morally also.
The social, economic, political, and moral order of both bourgeois and
prescriptive societies was small in scale, local in span, and individualized or
particularistic in structure. Indeed, the characteristic and dominant ideology
of  the  bourgeois  order  was  a  form  of  individualism: the  belief  that  the
individual as moral agent, economic actor, and citizen was the basic and
proper unit  of  society.  And  individualism was  reflected in  bourgeois
institutions. “Bourgeois culture,” wrote Raymond Williams, “is the basic
individualist idea  and  the  institutions, manners, habits of  thought and
intentions which proceed from that.”
## [16]
Bourgeois thought, however, did not
conceive of individualism as antisocial or entirely separate from society but
as rooted in and responsible to moral duties and social institutions. The
family,  the  local  community,  the  church, social class, and  the
entrepreneurial firm reinforced the identity and aspirations of the individual
and spun the web of his moral beliefs and habits; and the sociable and
moral nature of the individual was recognized in bourgeois popular culture
and practice, even if it was often ignored in the formal doctrines of 19th-
century political theory. The fiction of Horatio Algerin America and the
homilies of Samuel Smiles in England reflect the highly moralized and

disciplined individualism of the bourgeois ideal. To Smiles (1812-1904),
“Good works, honestly done,  character sustained, and  independence
secured were more important than worldly success.”

While the ethos of bourgeois individualism was sociable and moralistic,
it rejected and distrusted heroic and transcendental ideals. “Domesticity,
privacy, comfort, the concept of the home and of the family: these are,
literally,  principal achievements of  the  Bourgeois Age,”  writes historian
## John Lukacs.
## [18]
The bourgeois ethic was secular and utilitarian in its ideals.
It derived in part from the Protestant Ethic and emphasized the ascetic and
individual virtues  of  hard  work, thrift, prudence, and  deferral of
gratification. It regarded laziness, conspicuous consumption and luxury, and
immediate gratification of appetites as morally evil and the root of social
decadence. “Only the methodical way of life of the ascetic sects,” wrote
Max  Weber,  “could legitimate  and  put  a  halo  around the  economic
‘individualist’ impulses of the modern capitalist ethos.”
## [19]
The bourgeois
ethic took pride in individual (especially moral) achievements and regarded
personal wealth as an outward and visible sign of inward personal character.
Wealth  consisted not  merely in  large  bank  accounts but  in  visible and
concrete matter:  hard  property in  the  form  of  large  houses and  public
buildings ornately decorated and  heavily furnished, many  servants and
children, complex but rather drab clothing, and a heavy figure. President
William Howard Taft, the fattest president in American history, personified
the successful bourgeois in the high noon of the bourgeois order, as do the
caricatures of businessmen still drawn for socialist and labor propaganda.
“The bourgeois,” writes Peter Berger,
believed in the virtue of work, as against the aristocratic idealization of (genteel) leisure . .
. in Protestant countries it tended toward a style of inconspicuous consumption. . . . The
bourgeois emphasized personal responsibility (“conscience,” especially in its Protestant
form). . . . [B]ourgeois culture was individuating at the core of its moral worldview. Also,

the bourgeoisie went in for “clean living,” both in the literal and the derived (moral) sense.
This theme (epitomized in the maxim that “cleanliness is next to godliness”) carried into
the  minutiae of  daily  conduct—the manners of  dress  and  speech, habits of  personal
hygiene, the appearance of the home.
## [20]
The bourgeois order and its ethic, however, are ineffective in providing
discipline for mass society, and their persistence acts as a constraint on the
development of managerial capitalism. The attempt in the late 19th century
to retain bourgeois institutions and values as disciplines for the new mass
and scale of society led to corruption, economic and social breakdowns,
political crisis, and a considerable degree of social pathology. Moreover, the
entrepreneurial firm and the form of capitalism based on it, as well as the
moral framework of bourgeois society, are obstacles to the growth of mass
corporations and the kind of society and economy in which they flourish.
The  dissolution  of  the  bourgeois  economic, social, political, and  moral
order  therefore was  and  remains a  necessary part  of  the  dynamic of
managerial capitalism.
The  individualism of  the  bourgeois  order  and  the  institutions that
reinforce it restrict the development of the collective disciplines that are
inherent in mass organizations. The mass corporation must subordinate the
ambitions, values, and eccentricities of its individual managers and workers
to  its  own  collective goals  and  routines. Teams, departments, and
committees are  the  units  of  mass  corporate activity.  “That  upward path
toward the rainbow of achievement,” wrote William H.   Whyte Jr., “leads
smack through the conference room.”
No  matter  what  name the  process is  called—permissive management, multiple
management, the art of administration—the committee way simply can’t be equated with
the “rugged” individualism that is supposed to be the business of business. . . . The man of
the future, as junior executives [in the 1950s] see him, is not the individualist but the man
who works through others for others.
## [21]
And the collective conformity that the “organization man” of the mass

corporation exhibits in his professional life is reflected in his social life as
well in dress, tastes, uses of leisure, community, and home. It is therefore in
the  interests as  well  as  consistent with  the  mentality and  habits  of  the
managerial elite in the mass corporation to undermine the individualism of
the bourgeois order and the institutions that sustain it.
Similarly,  the  mass  corporation  must  seek  to  break down  the
differentiations that  characterize the  bourgeois  order,  the  diversity that
exists in a decentralized and localized society that is not united by mass
communications, transportation, and  markets. The  corporation must
promote the  homogenization of  society because of  the  nature of  mass
production and  mass  consumption.  Mass  production requires not  only
homogeneous goods and  services,  produced by  the  same  molds and
processes, but  also  homogeneous  consumers, who  cannot vary  in  their
tastes, values, and patterns of consumption and who must consume if the
planning of the corporations is to be effective. The comparatively compact
and  differentiated institutions of  the  bourgeois order sustain its
heterogeneity and constrain the consumption of mass-produced goods and
services. Managerial capitalism must therefore articulate and sponsor an
ideology of cosmopolitanism that asserts universal identities, values, and
loyalties, challenges the  differentiations of  the  bourgeois  order,  and
rationalizes the process of homogenization. In the cosmopolitan view of
man, family, local community, religious sect, social class, sexual and racial
identity, and moral character are at best subordinate considerations and are
regarded as artificial, repressive, and obsolete barriers to the fulfillment of
human potential. Cosmopolitanism thus  rationalizes the  adoption of  the
mass framework and collective disciplines that characterize the managerial
regime and  the  homogenization of  production and  consumption through
which the  multinational organizations and  economies of  managerial

capitalism operate.
The moral code of ascetic individualism that characterizes the bourgeois
order also constrains mass consumption and the patterns of behavior that
generate it. The managerial economy, in collaboration with the mass media,
challenges the bourgeois moral code by the projection of anti-bourgeois
values in mass advertising, the central image of which is not the character
of  the  product but  a  homogenized  stereotype of  the  consumer.  Mass
advertising itself is a principal source and a reflection of the moral code of
mass  managerial society.  So  far  from  being  the  rigorous code  of  the
Protestant-bourgeois  ethic  (or  the  equally  rigorous code  of  honor and
deference of  the  aristocratic prescriptive order), the  moral formula of
managerial capitalism is  a  justification of  mass,  the  legitimization of
immediate gratification of appetites and desires, and the rejection of ascetic
individualism and values that enforce frugality, thrift, prudence, continence,
sacrifice, and the postponement or denial of gratification. “The real social
revolution in modern society,” writes Daniel Bell,
came in the 1920s, when the rise of mass production and high consumption began to
transform the life of the middle class itself. In effect the Protestant ethic as a social reality
and a lifestyle for the middle class was replaced by a materialistic hedonism, and the
Puritan temper by  a  psychological eudaemonism. .  .  .  [T]he  claim  of  the  American
economic system was that it had introduced abundance, and the nature of abundance is to
encourage prodigality rather than prudence. A higher standard of living, not work as an end
in itself, then becomes the engine of change. The glorification of plenty, rather than the
bending to niggardly nature, becomes the justification of the system.
## [22]
Mass  advertising, by  its  manipulation of  symbols and  images of
authority, pleasure, sentiment, and sexuality, serves to articulate an informal
ethic or ideology of hedonism, and advertising, modern credit devices, and
the manipulation of mass purchasing power and aggregate demand serve to
encourage patterns of hedonistic behavior in the mass population.
The managerial elite of the mass corporations thus has a group interest

in destroying the individualism and diversity of the bourgeois order through
its collective discipline and homogenizing processes. It also subverts the
bourgeois work ethic and its derivative values through its promotion of
mass hedonism and consumption. These two tendencies of the managerial
elite the collective and homogenizing, on the one hand, and the hedonistic
and indulgent, on the other appear to be in tension with each other and
constitute part  of  what  Bell  has  called “the  cultural contradiction of
capitalism.”
## [23]
The tension between these two tendencies may represent a
serious vulnerability that  could lead  to  the  ultimate breakdown or
replacement of the managerial regime. Yet the social function of hedonism
of the managerial economy is not liberation or a release from all restrictions
but only from bourgeois constraints, and hedonism and the ethic associated
with  it  are  themselves among the  principal social disciplines  of  the
managerial regime. A central theme of mass advertising is the desirable
competition among consumers for more, newer, or improved products and
services, a theme that suggests that consumption is a form of conformity
and liberation, a discipline. Mass hedonism in the managerial economy is a
set  of  beliefs and  a  pattern of  behavior that  must  be  inculcated and
channeled into  mass  consumption,  and  it  is  not  permitted to  pursue an
independent and unrestrained course. Only those appetites are stimulated,
rationalized, and gratified that the managerial economy is able to stimulate,
rationalize, and gratify and only for so long as it is convenient to do so.
Viewed in this perspective, then, mass hedonism is less in contradiction to
the collective and homogenizing tendencies of managerial capitalism than
would at  first  appear.  In  fact,  both  of  them  serve  the  interests of  the
managerial elite, both undermine the bourgeois order, and both function as
non-coercive, manipulative disciplines of the mass population.
The  collectivism, homogenization, and  hedonism of  the  managerial

economy are also consistent with the managerial subversion of the hard
property of the bourgeoisie. No institution is so central to the integrity and
dominance of the bourgeois order as private property. The political and
economic ideologies associated with the bourgeoisie gave private property a
key role, and the institution underlies the wealth, status, and power of the
bourgeois  elite,  as  well  as  its  social  extensions and  institutions in  the
privately owned home, the  family,  and  the  community of  households.
Although private property continues to exist under managerial capitalism,
its social and political meaning has altered dramatically and in ways that
accrue to the benefit of the managerial elite and in conflict with the interests
of the bourgeois elite.
Both Berle and Means, and James Burnham argued that the separation
of ownership and control would diminish the attachment and interests of the
managerial groups to private property and that, as a result, the managers
would be far less opposed to public regulation of the use and disposal of
private property than the bourgeois classes had been. Joseph Schumpeter,
indeed, had made essentially the same point:
The capitalist process, by substituting a mere parcel of shares for the walls of and the
machines in a factory, takes the life out of the idea of property. It loosens the grip that once
was so strong: the grip in the sense of the legal right and the actual ability to do as one
pleases with one’s own; the grip also in the sense that the holder of the title loses the will
to fight, economically, physically, politically, for ‘his’ factory and his control over it, to die
if necessary on its steps. . . . Dematerialized, defunctionalized and absentee ownership
does  not  impress and  call  forth  moral  allegiance as  the  vital  form  of  property  did.
Eventually there will be nobody left who really cares to stand for it, nobody within and
nobody without the precincts of the big concerns.
## [24]
And John Lukacs has seen this “dematerialization of property” as part of
a general emotional and intellectual pattern of 20th-century science and
society,  “the  immaterialization of  matter,”  which “leads to  abstraction,
inflation, unreality, at times spilling over into madness.”
## [25]

The  managerial elite  has  little  objection to  this  process of  the
dematerialization of  property and  much  to  gain  from  it. The  managers’
wealth does not derive from the private property they own but from the
salaries that  specialized skills  command, and  in  general, as Galbraith
acknowledges and as Burnham foresaw, the technostructure does not seek
immense personal wealth or large accumulations of personal property. The
dematerialization of property actually assists the position of the managers
by  undermining the  bourgeois  institution of  hard  private property and
removing one of the principal emotional and theoretical obstacles to the
public regulation of  property and  economic life.  Dematerialization of
property diminishes the perception of ownership and hence the opposition
to interference with the rights of property. It also diminishes the emotional
values of property and the sense of loss when property is alienated. This
result is essential to mass consumption, especially to consumption through
credit. Consumers, purchasing through credit goods and services that they
as yet lack the property to buy, are less reluctant to make such purchases if
the property they expend does not tangibly exist in any case.
The  dematerialization of  property  is  also  a  central element in  the
evolution of  the  managerial political order,  for  it  not  only  diminishes
opposition to public regulation of the economy but also undermines the
autonomy and power of bourgeois and other social forces that challenge or
resist the managerial regime. The diffusion of hard private property among
the middle classes of 19th-century Europe and America was a basic pillar of
the political independence and constitutional regimes of the bourgeois era.
This was recognized by the Italian political scientist Gaetano Mosca at the
end of that era. “A society is best placed to develop a relatively perfect
political organization,” wrote  Mosca, “when it  contains a  large  class  of
people whose economic position is virtually independent of those who hold

supreme power.”
## [26]

The  dematerialization of  property eliminates the
capacity of  hard  property to  provide independence and  a  means of
resistance to the concentrated and fused power of the managerial sectors of
mass society. The dematerialized property of the mass managerial economy
is thus analogous to the role of property in the kind of regime that Karl
Wittfogel called the “hydraulic society,” also ruled by managerial elites, of
the ancient world. In such societies, wrote Wittfogel,
Whether hydraulic property is large or small or whether or not it belongs to a member of
the governing class, it provides material advantages. But it does not enable its holders to
control state power through property-based organizations and action. In all cases, it is not
power property but revenue property.
## [27]
Mass society and the managerial regime that rules it have, in the West
and thus far in time, not led to the abolition of private property, as James
Burnham and  others who  foresaw the  rise  of  the  managers predicted.
Private property  still  exists  in  a  legal  and  formal sense, and  it  remains
important for  the  acquisition of  wealth. But  the  dematerialization of
property,  while  leaving intact  the  illusion that  private property in  the
traditional sense survives, deprives property of the social, moral, emotional,
and political functions that it possessed in the prescriptive and bourgeois
orders of  the  past—and without which those  orders cannot  exist.  The
managerial economy of the Western world remains a capitalist economy in
that it continues to depend on the private use of property as an instrument of
exchange and  production. Yet  the  dematerialization of  property and  the
close  relationship between the  economy and  the  state  encouraged by  it
create a system of bureaucratic or managerial capitalism that operates quite
differently from  traditional or  entrepreneurial capitalism. Managerial
capitalism, unlike its entrepreneurial ancestor, is directly dependent on the
state, and the fusion of state and economy represents also a fusion of the
managerial elites  of  these  sectors. The  dematerialization of  property is

therefore an essential underpinning of the managerial regime of its own
moral formula of mass hedonism and of its displacement of the power and
values of the bourgeois regime and of the fusion of state and economy that
characterizes the  regime, a  fusion  that  is  tantamount to  collectivism,
regardless of  whether “collectivism” has  been  formally or  legally
established.
The  economic conflict between the  managerial groups in  the  mass
corporations and  the  old  bourgeois  elite  of  entrepreneurial capitalism
manifests itself in non-economic political and ideological struggles as well
as in the economy, and there is an analogous conflict in the other sectors of
mass society where managerial elites emerge in competition with bourgeois
strata. The political struggle between the bourgeois and managerial elites,
like the economic conflicts between them, manifests itself and results in
institutional and ideological changes that are in substance a civilizational
revolution.

## The Managerial State
Like the mass corporation in the economy, the mass state evolved as a
response of bourgeois institutions to the revolution of mass and scale in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries. The mere increase of population in that
period encouraged and made possible the dramatic enlargement of the state
by adding to the number of its subjects and citizens and thereby increasing
the resources on which the state could draw for war, civilian employees,
and taxation. Yet the congestion that the increase of population caused also
contributed to the increase in the scale and scope of state power, functions,
personnel, and expenses. In the late 19th century, it became clear that the
circumscribed and neutralist bourgeois state could not discipline the mass
population or cope with the problems created by the concentration of the
new  masses in urban conglomerations. Slums, illiteracy,  poverty,
unemployment, disease, crime, and the general insecurity and brutality of
the developing mass society threatened to dissolve the political and social
fabric and contributed to the radicalization of the masses. The reformulation
of classical liberalism to justify social and economic action by the state and
the  popularization of  socialism, feminism, and  other  radical ideologies
(including radical right-wing ideas) were part of the intellectual adjustment
of the bourgeois order to the revolution of mass and scale; and labor unions
and radical political movements contributed to the willful expansion of the
state in the late 19th century as well as to the development of new political
institutions to contain and discipline the mass population. Both liberals and
conservatives in that period also often supported and encouraged the growth
of  the  state,  despite the  hostility with  which their  ideologies and
constituents regarded a  large  and  active government. The  willing

encouragement of the growth of government was partly due to the new
ideologies associated with mass society and to humanitarian concerns but
also  to  sheer  pragmatic realization that  the  state  was  the  most  obvious
instrument for coping with what appeared to be otherwise irreconcilable
and destructive challenges.
In addition to the increase in population, the congestion and problems
that the increase caused, and the ideological and practical reconsiderations
associated with early mass society, a further impetus for the expansion of
the state lay in the changing nature of war in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries and in the new territorial scale of states that expanded through
imperialism and colonization. With  the  new  technologies increasingly
available in  the  late  19th  century,  warfare itself  became  a  mass
phenomenon, requiring mass  armies equipped with  mass  produced
weaponry,  uniforms, housing, provisions, and  services. Weaponry
underwent a  revolution in  scale  in  the  development of  artillery and
dreadnoughts, as did the means of transportation and communications in the
development of radios, telegraphy, telephones, and motorization. War and
the  preparations  for  war,  which increasingly occupied the  attention of
Western states after 1870 and were to obsess them throughout most of the
20th century, thus required further revolutionary expansion in the scale of
state financing and taxation, the number of civilian and military personnel
and  offices,  the  technical sophistication of  state  personnel, and  the
complexity and  scope  of  the  administrative functions of  the  state.  The
experience of “total war” during World War I involved the mobilization and
coordination of masses of people, economic resources, and technology as
well  as  of  social and  psychological processes through propaganda.
“Technical change,” writes William H. McNeill, “was matched by no less
deliberate changes in human society and daily routines.”

Millions of  men  were  drafted into  armies and  induced to  submit to  radically  new
conditions of life—and death. Other millions entered factories, government offices, or
undertook some other unaccustomed kind of war work. Efficient allocation of labor soon
became a major factor in the war effort of every country; and the welfare of the workers,
as well as of fighting men, began to matter, since an ill-nourished or discontented work
force could not be expected to achieve maximum output. . . .
Ownership of  property became less  important; ascribed status, deriving from  an
individual’s place in a hierarchy of command—military or civil as the case might be—
tended to eclipse inherited rank, although to be sure the two often coincided. Despite
carryovers from the past, what ought to be called national socialism, if Hitler had not
preempted the term, emerged from the barracks and purchasing offices of the European
armed services and, with the help of a coalition of administrative elites drawn from big
business, big labor, academia, and big government, made European society over in an
amazingly short time.
## [28]
World War I accelerated the tendencies to organizational enlargement
and managerial direction in Europe and the United States and provided
models for the development of the managerial regime in later decades, as
did World War II in the 1940s. The economic scale of the First World War
compelled a reorganization of the national economy and state machinery in the form of
war socialism, or Zwangswirtschaft. The expanded state of many agencies and tentacles
directed the economic life of the nation and put into operation a planned economy for the
purpose of utilizing the national resources with maximum efficiency in the prosecution of
the war. The state was forced to create a mechanism for ordering priorities of allocations
and distribution of scarce raw materials and manpower.
## [29]
The evolution of the mass state was thus comparable to the evolution of
the mass corporation. The increase in the size of the state consisted not only
in larger budgets and more personnel but also in the proliferation of its
functions in regulating the  economy,  supervising and  engineering social
institutions, and  preparing for  and  conducting the  total  mobilization of
natural, human, social, economic, psychological, and  technological
resources for mass warfare. These new functions were highly technical in
nature and required the application of the physical and social sciences, the
techniques of administration, and the skills of mass communication to the
goal of what McNeill has called “human engineering,”
## [30]
the development

of which was pioneered under the impact of the revolution of mass and
scale in the late 19th century. The performance of these functions required
the appointment of specially trained officials in formally subordinate but
strategically powerful positions.
These officials constitute the managerial elite of the mass state and are
largely identical to the bureaucracy of the public sector, defined by the
British administrative historian G.E. Aylmer as
administration, either public or  private, by  fulltime salaried officials, who  are
professionals, graded and organised hierarchically, with regular procedures and formalised
recordkeeping, and  recruited for  the  tasks  in  hand.  This  is  essentially the  definition
established by the great German sociologist of the late 19th—early 20th century, Max
## Weber.
## [31]
Weber himself noted the relationship between the enlargement of the
state, the proliferation of its technical functions, its bureaucratization, and
its differentiation from the traditional prescriptive and bourgeois state:
It  is  obvious that  technically the  great  modern state  is  absolutely dependent upon  a
bureaucratic basis. The larger the state, and the more it is or the more it becomes a great
power state, the more unconditionally is this the case. . . . Bureaucratization offers above
all the optimum possibility for carrying through the principle of specializing administrative
functions according to  purely objective considerations. Individual performances are
allocated to functionaries who have specialized training and who by constant practice learn
more and more. . . . The more complicated and specialized modern culture becomes, the
more  its  external supporting apparatus demands the  personally detached and  strictly
“objective” expert, in lieu of the master of the older social structures, who was moved by
personal sympathy and favor, by grace and gratitude.
## [32]
The bureaucrats of the mass state are thus analogous to the management
or technostructure of the mass corporation. Like the corporation, the mass
state undertakes a wide range of diverse and highly technical activities in
the economy, society, science, communications, and war, in addition to its
purely administrative and  political functions. The  latter  also  become
increasingly specialized, technical, and complex to the point where today
academic degrees and  entire  schools of  public administration  exist  and

flourish. Traditional government functions, disciplines, and academic fields
such  as  law,  international relations, and  law  enforcement also  become
increasingly specialized and technical and thus assume the characteristics of
management.
The  mass  state  is  analogous to  the  mass  corporation also  in  the
relationship between its mass membership, which holds a formal right of
control, and its elite, which exercises substantive control. Just as there is a
dispersion of  ownership in  the  corporate organizations, so  there  is  a
dispersion of the “owners” of the state, i.e., its citizens or traditional ruling
class;  and  just  as  there  is  a  separation of  ownership and  control in  the
corporation, so there is a separation between the formal rulers of the state
(its citizens, traditional ruling class, and the holders of elective office) and
those who administer the state and its activities.
The increasing democratization of the state in the late 19th and early
20th centuries and the increasing participation of the mass population in
formal political processes did not appreciably modify the emergence of a
new managerial elite in government and, in fact, assisted its emergence and
its  acquisition of  power.  The  advance of  political democracy,  the
enfranchisement and political participation of the mass population in this
period, was comparable to the dispersion of stock ownership that occurred
in  the  mass  corporation and  constituted a  dispersion of sovereignty.
Although both the small stockholder and the average citizen acquired a
formal, legal  right  to  participation, neither generally possessed the
opportunity,  the  interest, or  the  ability to  participate intelligently in  the
control and  direction of  mass  organizations in  the  economy or  the
government. The democratization of the mass state—through equality of
citizenship and the equal votes and equal protection of the laws that the

mass state guarantees its citizens—and the dispersion of sovereignty that
democratization involved thus did nothing to restrict the emergence of a
managerial elite in the state or to restrain the enhancement of its power, and
helped to ensure the acquisition of actual control of the mass state by an
elite technically proficient in the performance of its new functions. Equality
of votes in the state does not determine the amount of actual power that
citizens in the state possess. In the state sector of mass society and in the
mass corporation, actual power is distributed according to managerial skills
and not by a formal equality of rights and votes or by legal ownership.
Nor  were  members of  the  traditional ruling class  or  the  holders of
elective and hereditary office analogous to the “big stockholders” of the
corporation able to undertake the managerial functions of the mass state.
Traditional elites were generally indifferent or hostile to the new functions
of the state and, in any case, were not prepared to perform them because of
their lack of managerial skills. Politicians who acquired formal office by
means of  elections also  were  generally unprepared to  undertake
management of the mass state. Their principal qualification for office was
simply their  personal ability to  win  elections, a  qualification with  little
connection to the ability to perform managerial functions. Moreover, the
development of managerial skills for the control of elections—the use of
mass  communications and  public relations techniques, of  demographic
analysis of  constituencies and  social and  economic studies of  voting
behavior, and of specialized financial and administrative skills in campaign
organizations—tended to reduce elected officials to dependence on these
skills and to subordinate the voting process to the techniques of electoral
management. Indeed, the use of such electoral techniques contributes to and
extends the power of managerial elites in mass politics and government.
“The new technology of communications,”wrote V.O. Key in 1964,

may be laying the basis for a much tighter top control of campaigns. . . . This funneling of
communications lays the basis for a thoroughgoing enforcement of campaign strategy, for
an insistence upon adherence to common themes, for a complete coordination of party
appeals. Instantaneous  communication over  the  nation also  makes less  tolerable  the
disunity that  often  prevails at  the  top  level  of  party  organization. The  picturesque
professional politician and the hard-bitten newspaperman who predominated around the
old-fashioned campaign headquarters may be yielding to the advertising men and to the
public-relations expert.
## [33]
And the technology of electoral manipulation has evolved toward what
journalist Sidney Blumenthal calls “the permanent campaign,” which relies
on  media consultants and  “new  techniques based  on  computers—direct
mail,  voter  identification methods, sophisticated polling,” all  of  which
“remakes government into  an  instrument designed to  sustain an  elected
official’s popularity. It is the engineering of consent with a vengeance.”
## [34]
The stratification of power in the mass state is thus analogous to that
within the corporation. In the latter, power is divided among the managers,
the big stockholders, and the mass of stockholders, who have virtually no
power.  In  the  mass  state,  power  is  divided among the  bureaucratic
managers, the  representatives of  the  bourgeois  elites  in  the  elective or
appointive offices of the formal state apparatus, and the mass of citizens,
who  have  virtually no  power in  the  state.  The  big  stockholders in  the
corporation, the  grand bourgeoisie, have  become dependent on  and
beneficiaries of  managerial capitalism. In  the  state,  the  members of
bourgeois  elites  who  retain  formal control of  elective and  appointive
political offices  are  increasingly dependent on  and  beneficiaries of  the
managerial sectors of the state. The dependence of bourgeois elites in the
state on managerial elements is seen not only in the rise of professional
electoral and political managers but also in the proliferation of specialized,
professional staff in the Congress and of the “special assistants” who advise
the Cabinet level appointees in the executive bureaucracy. Even when the
holders of  elective and  appointive  office  are  drawn from  the  bourgeois

strata of mass society and seek to pursue bourgeois interests through their
offices, their dependence on managerial staff often constitutes a constraint
on their inclinations and a means of channeling the thrust of their activities
in the direction of managerial interests.
Yet despite the  dependence of  formal office  holders on  managerial
elements, the representatives of bourgeois forces retain more power in the
state than their counterparts in the corporation retain in the economy. This
political power is  based  largely  on  persistent bourgeois  control of local
communities and  constituencies that  enable bourgeois  elites  or  their
representatives to gain office in the mass state, and the control of locally
based political offices  by  bourgeois  forces has  made  possible their
continuing resistance to the enlargement of the managerial state and the
dominance of its elite.
In both the mass state and the mass corporation, therefore, the processes
by  which managerial elites emerge  and  assume control  of  mass
organizations are essentially the same. Whatever differences exist between
the state and the corporation as institutions do not significantly modify or
distinguish this pattern of elite formation, which appears to be inherent in
mass  organizations. In  both  the  mass  state  and  the  mass  corporation,
organizational enlargement involves a  proliferation of  highly technical
functions that  neither the  mass  membership (stockholders in  the
corporation, citizens  in  the  state)  nor  traditional elites, aristocratic or
bourgeois, are able to perform. The technicality of the functions of mass
organization creates a need or imperative for the appointment of technically
trained and qualified professional managers who, by virtue of their skills,
are able to perform these functions and thereby to undertake the operation
and direction of the mass organizations of government and the economy. In

both the political and economic sectors of mass society, there is a dispersion
of those who possess a formal or legal right to control (a dispersion of
sovereignty in the state and of ownership in the corporation), and in both
there is a separation between those with formal rights of control and those
who possess the functional ability to exercise control. The acquisition of
managerial skills by members of the bourgeois elite does little to bridge this
separation. Those who  acquire and  professionally exercise such  skills
thereby become part of the managerial group and acquire also its interests
and  outlook. For  the  most  part,  however,  the  bourgeois  elite  does  not
acquire managerial skills but continues to rely on its formal claims and its
characteristic institutions and ideologies as a foundation of its power and
social functions.
Moreover,  in  both  the  mass  state  and  the  mass  economy,  there  is  a
conflict of interests between the new, rising managerial elite and the old,
declining bourgeois elite. It is in the interest of the managers to encourage
the continuing expansion of the state and the corporation and thereby to
increase the need for and the rewards of their own skills and professions; it
is equally in the interest of the bourgeois elite to restrict or reduce this
expansion and  thereby to  resist  the  obsolescence of  their  political and
economic functions and power. The conflict between the managerial and
bourgeois  elites  is  not  merely political or  economic, however.  In  both
sectors, the conflict sets in motion a dynamic and has implications that
involve a  far  reaching transformation of  social  and  cultural institutions,
ideas, and values. This transformation amounts in fact to a civilizational
revolution, the destruction of both prescriptive and bourgeois civilizations
and an effort to develop a new managerial civilization.
The political apparatus and ideology of the bourgeois order reflected the

material interests of the bourgeois elite as well as its habits and values. The
power base of the bourgeois elite lay principally in small scale and localized
institutions and structures. The entrepreneurial firm, owned and operated by
an individual, family, or partnership, provided the proprietary and economic
basis  of  bourgeois  power as  well  as  a  significant degree of  status  and
informal influence. The local community and local government were the
bases of bourgeois political power, subject to the limited span and personal
and  informal means of  control  that  the  bourgeois  elite  possessed. The
bourgeois  family,  kinship network, and  circles of  friends, neighbors,
customers, clients, and dependents provided the social base of the highly
personal and informal regime of the bourgeois elite that rationalized and
expressed its  power in  the  bourgeois  formulas of  socialized or  ascetic
individualism, the Protestant Ethic, classical  liberalism,  and  utilitarian
aesthetics and styles. The bourgeois elite therefore had no interest in and
was in fact generally hostile to a large, centralized, powerful, and active
state. Centralization of power was a direct threat to the local jurisdictions
and communities that, under bourgeois control, allowed the elite to maintain
power in  the  national legislative assemblies. Tendencies toward
governmental activism—i.e., direct  intervention in  social  and  economic
processes—also threatened the bourgeois elite, since activism by the state
involved efforts to limit or alter the property rights and class relations of the
bourgeois elite and to interfere with the local and institutional bases of
bourgeois power. Throughout the 19th century, bourgeois elites vigorously
and successfully resisted any tendencies toward centralization and activism
through their power in national legislatures and local political and social
institutions and through adherence to constitutionalist and legalist doctrines
that denied the legitimacy of state intervention.
Although the bourgeois elite made use of state power on occasion to

secure its economic advantage, its principal political interest was in the use
of the state to control criminals and to suppress challenges to its dominance
from prescriptive reactionaries on  the  right  and  from radicals,
revolutionaries, and lower-class insurgents on the left. In the 19th century,
both of these political challenges from the right and left sought to use the
executive sectors of the state to limit or overthrow the bourgeois order, and
it  was  with  the  dynastic monarchies of  the  prescriptive order  that  the
established aristocracies, churches, and  privileged guilds, which the
bourgeoisie regarded as mortal enemies, had been associated. In practical
terms, therefore, the  bourgeois  elites  of  the  19th  century sought to
consolidate their  own  power and  circumscribe the  power  of  their
challengers through the control and supremacy of legislative assemblies and
through the formulation of laws and constitutions that effectively locked
these assemblies and the bourgeois elites that controlled them into power.
This  process constituted what  R.R.    Palmer  called “The  Age  of  the
Democratic Revolution,” by which what would become bourgeois forces
delivered themselves from the power of established monarchs, churches,
aristocracies, guilds, and other privileged institutions. “In Europe,” writes
## Palmer,
the  revolutionary movement, though it  carried aristocratic liberalism and  Babouvist
communism at its fringes, was most especially a middleclass or “bourgeois” affair, aimed
at the reconstruction of an old order, and at the overthrow of aristocracies, nobilities,
patriciates, and other privileged classes.
## [35]
In America, the reconstruction was partially achieved in the American
Revolution, but the bourgeois elite in the United States did not acquire
complete social and political dominance until it was able to extirpate the
prescriptive order of the American South in the Civil War and to exclude
and suppress the Southern elites in the Reconstruction Era.

The political conflict between the bourgeois order and the managerial
elite in the mass state takes place within the state itself, and the principal
issue of the conflict is the creation of the mass state, the expansion and
proliferation of  governmental functions. The  conflict is  located  in  the
struggles between  the  executive sector,  increasingly occupied and
controlled by the managerial forces, and the legislative assemblies, in which
bourgeois elites or their political representatives predominate; between the
central arm of the state, also the seat of the managerial bureaucracy, and the
local jurisdictions and institutions that constitute a bourgeois power base;
and  between  the  rule  of  the  state  by  administrative, bureaucratic, and
technical procedures and the rule of the state by bourgeois constitutionalist
and legalist formulas. The institutional location of the latter aspect of the
conflict lies in the conflict between bureaucratic agencies and commissions,
on the one hand, and the courts and institutions of the bourgeois legal and
judicial system, on the other.
The  managerial  elite  within the  mass  state  seeks  to  centralize  state
power,  reduce the  power of  national legislatures, and  establish  a  more
activist and  interventionist government that  depends on  executive
leadership of the state and, ultimately, of mass society. The vehicle for the
managerial centralization of  power and  the  reduction of  the  legislative
assemblies is managerial Caesarism, the reliance on a single leader allied
with the mass population against the intermediary institutions and structures
of the bourgeois order and using the managerial skills of the new elite to
undermine bourgeois  power and  consolidate managerial power. Through
Caesarist political leadership, the  managerial elite  seeks also  to
bureaucratize the  functions of  the  state  and  to  replace the  legalistic
bourgeois political order with a bureaucratic state under its own control.

The managerial bureaucracy of the mass state is necessarily located in
the executive sector of the central government. This is the logical location
of  the  bureaucracy,  since  its  main  function is  to  execute, enforce, and
administer the laws. Yet its association with the executive sector is also part
of the relationship between rising elites and Caesarist political leaders that
appears throughout history. Thus, as Weber pointed out,
Viewed  technically,  as  an  organized form  of  authority,  the  efficiency of  “Caesarism,”
which often grows out of democracy, rests in general upon the position of the “Caesar” as
a free trustee of the masses . . . who is unfettered by tradition. The “Caesar” is thus the
unrestrained master of a body of highly qualified military officers and officials whom he
selects freely and personally without regard to tradition or to any other consideration.
## [36]
A  Caesarist  political leader,  basing his  power on  his  personal
competence and charismatic appeal, uses the mass population to undermine
the institutions, traditions, and power of an existing elite and elevates a
section of his mass following to the position of a new elite. Since the new
elite  is  closely associated with  and  dependent on  the  leader,  it  cannot
establish its  independent power until  the  leader’s  charisma has  become
“routinized” or  disassociated from  his  person and  institutionalized in  a
bureaucratic regime. The new elite then rules as a bureaucratic class, and its
dependence on charismatic leaders is diminished. This pattern has occurred
many times  in  human history under the  Greek tyrants and  Roman
demagogues of antiquity, under the Tudors and Bourbons of early modern
Europe, and  in  the  19th  and  20th  centuries in  the  form  of  managerial
Caesarism. What is distinctive about the 20th-century version of this pattern
is  the  coincidence of  plebiscitary and  charismatic Caesarism with
managerial skills and techniques.
The  association  of  the  managerial elite  in  the  state  with  charismatic
Caesarist leaders appealing to a mass following enables the emergent elite
to  ally  with  the  masses against  the  bourgeois  elites  in  their  legislative,

judicial, and  local  power bases. The  congestion of  the  masses and  the
incipient collapse of traditional institutions under the impact of the new
mass and scale provide an opportunity and a pretext and, indeed, often a
valid  reason  for  the  attack on  obsolescent and  self-serving bourgeois
institutions and for the extension of the managerial state into the bourgeois
power base,  and  the  dispersion of sovereignty  that  occurs in  mass
democracies assists the managerial elite in assuming control of state power.
The managerial elite in the executive bureaucracy seeks to centralize
political power in  its  own  functions and  in  its  Caesarist leader and  to
undermine the  legislative assemblies, electoral districts, decentralized
institutions, and local communities in which bourgeois political power is
based. The managers, ostensibly on behalf of the masses and their welfare,
undertake programs of  economic intervention and  regulation,  political
reform, and social engineering, the results of which accrue to the interests
of  the  managers as  their  apparatus is  enlarged  and  its  scope  extended.
Managerial elements  thus  encourage the  extension of  the  franchise to
groups that the bourgeois elite cannot discipline, establish new agencies and
programs that  organize anti-bourgeois  forces and  undermine the  local
power base of the bourgeois elite in local communities, and institute new
functions for the executive sector of the state that legislative assemblies and
their bourgeois members are unable to perform or control. These activities
subvert, eliminate, or circumvent the localized and legislative power bases
of the bourgeois elite, the authority and formulas of which are reinterpreted
or  adapted  to  bring  them  into  line  with  the  imperatives of  managerial
Caesarism. In the extreme cases in which managerial elites have seized
power by violence (as in Russia and Germany in the early 20th century), the
bourgeois power centers are simply suppressed and the bourgeoisie itself is
exterminated or coercively dispossessed.

The principal justification for managerial centralization of power and
functions is  that  bourgeois  political institutions are  too  inefficient and
cumbersome to solve the problems identified by the managerial elite and
that the bourgeois elite is itself hostile to such solutions because they are
threats to its power and interests. In fact, there is considerable truth in the
managerial argument. Bourgeois political institutions were established to
protect the localized power bases and private interests of the bourgeois elite
and  are  intentionally cumbersome  to  prevent the  enlargement of  the
centralized state and its intervention in social and economic processes. The
managerial argument against these  institutions, however,  also  serves
managerial interests by implicitly or explicitly rejecting the legitimacy of
the  bourgeois  political ideal  of  a  limited and  neutralist state  and  thus
contains revolutionary presuppositions that in effect redefine the ends of the
state.
The  redefinition  of  the  state  consists largely  in  the  substitution  of
bureaucratic and  administrative procedure for  the  constitutionalism  and
legalism that  characterized bourgeois  government, a  substitution that
converts the state from what Michael Oakeshott calls a “nomocracy,” in
which “laws  are  understood as  conditions of  conduct, not  devices
instrumental to  the  satisfaction of  preferred wants,” to  a  “teleocratic”
government, “the management of a purposive concern.”
## [37]
The bourgeois
elites, in their struggle against the dynastic monarchs in the 18th and 19th
centuries, depended on the rule of law, i.e., the determination of general
relationships among citizens and between citizens and the state by regular,
codified, or customary principles generally believed to be morally just. The
subjugation of the dynastic monarchies to such regular principles restrained
the personal will of the monarch and the prescriptive elites associated with
him, and the control of the lawmaking bodies the legislative assemblies and

courts by the bourgeoisie enabled the bourgeois elite to enact laws that
reflected its  political and  economic  interests. The  formulas of  “equality
before the  law”  and  “the  rule  of  law,  not  men,” seemingly seeking to
establish just  and  uniform relationships among all  citizens,  in  fact
undermined the power of the prescriptive elites and in practice generally did
not apply to the lower classes and masses that emerged in the 19th century.
Moreover, the constitutionally limited state of the bourgeois political order,
like  Oakeshott’s  nomocratic ruler,  was  “a  master of  ceremonies, not  an
arbiter of fashion. His concern is with the ‘manners’ of convives, and his
office is to keep the conversation going, not to determine what is said.”
## [38]
By thus restricting the activities of the bourgeois state and the ends that it
was allowed to pursue by means of the “rule of law” formula, the bourgeois
political elite eliminated threats to its localized and privatized interests from
government.
The managerial bureaucracies have generally sought to replace both the
reliance on  law  as  well  as  the  content of  legal  codes  with  reliance on
procedure and revised laws and interpretations that accrue to their benefit.
The difference between law and administrative procedure is that the former
is  formulated for  general purposes  and  the  latter  to  implement  specific
policies. “Policy,” writes F.A. Hayek,
is  rightly  contrasted with  legislation when  it  means the  pursuit of  the  concrete, ever
changing aims of the day. It is with the execution of policy in this sense that administration
proper is concerned. Its task is the direction and allocation of revenues put at the disposal
of government in the service of the constantly changing needs of the community. . . . The
tendency of the professional administrators concerned with these tasks is inevitably to
draw everything they can into the service of the public aims they are pursuing.
## [39]
And  Hayek quotes the  jurist  Edgar Bodenheimer  on  the  difference
between law and administration: “Law is mainly concerned with rights,
administration is mainly concerned with results. Law is conducive to liberty

and  security,  while administration promotes efficiency and  quick
decision.”
## [40]
In the managerial regime, however, the meaning of law and the role of
the courts differ radically from what they were in the bourgeois order. Both
“legal realism,” which rejects the formalistic view prevalent in 19th-century
bourgeois legal theory “that law is an abstract entity present as the meaning
of a given statute, waiting to be found by a judge,”
## [41]
and “sociological
jurisprudence,”  which seeks  to  adjust legal  principles to  social and
economic conditions, seek to challenge bourgeois legal formalism and to
expand the role of courts in legitimizing and instigating social change that
is  designed and  engineered by  the  emergent  managerial elite.  Thus  the
emergence of the managerial regime precipitated a change in the content
and meaning of law as well as in its political and social functions that
reflected the interests and aspirations of the new elite and delegitimized
those of the old elite and its order.
The goals of efficiency and utility, of formulating rules that correspond
to  varying situations as  they  arise  and  appear useful rather  than  to  the
general needs and values of a community, ignore the general application
and sovereignty of law. The technicality and specialization that characterize
the  direction of  mass  organizations require reliance on  such  varying
procedures as well as the abandonment of general law. The variability of
administrative procedures is one reason why bureaucratic administration
and  the  rules  it  formulates are  so  many,  so  complicated, and  often  so
contradictory. Each procedure is applied to specific situations rather than to
general relationships, and specific situations are necessarily variable. The
variability of procedure also enables the managerial elite in the mass state
to disregard legal principles that are inconvenient to its interests and to rely

on what it defines as “social needs” (which happen to correspond to the
interests of  the  elite)  as  the  criterion for  new  regulations. Furthermore,
because law by its nature deals with general relationships, it recognizes that
some  specific situations are  beyond the  remedy of  law, ultra vires.
Administrative procedures, and  those  who  use  them,  recognize no  such
limit. Every problem, complaint, and situation is believed to lie within the
competence of  the  expert to  solve  through the  application of  technical
expertise and the formulation of procedures. The belief that administrative
procedure is  an  adequate and  proper means of  regulating human
communities enhances the  power of  the  managerial elite  and  also
encourages the meliorist or utopian ideologies that accompany managerial
regimes and which are lacking in pre-mass societies ruled by law.
The  managerial justification for  the  substitution of  administration,
bureaucracy,  and  expertise for  bourgeois  legal  codes  and  judicial and
legislative institutions is  the  claim  that  managerial technique is  able  to
resolve the  conflicts and  flaws  of  human society and  to  ameliorate the
human condition. Thus, crime, war, ignorance, poverty, disease, slums, etc.,
become “problems” to  be  “solved” by  management and  its  formula of
scientism, the application of science to human relations and institutions; and
the managers portray the persistence of bourgeois institutions and values as
itself  a  problem or  obstacle to  managerial progress. The  claims of  the
managers are generalized in meliorist and utopian formulas that not only
serve the interests of the managerial elite as a whole but also exert immense
appeal to the mass population. Meliorist and utopian formulas are contained
also in what Christopher Lasch has called “the new therapeutic conception
of the state,”
## [42]
which regards autonomous social institutions as the sources
of  social pathologies that  must  be  “cured” and  “corrected” by
bureaucratically administered and scientifically informed “therapies” that

serve to transfer control of the processes of socialization to the managerial
bureaucracy. The fostering of meliorism and utopianism by the managerial
state is thus implicit in its political dynamic as well as in its bureaucratic
character and  its  specialized managerial and  technical skills,  just  as  the
fostering of mass hedonism and cosmopolitanism is implicit in the dynamic
of managerial capitalism.
The managerial state not only disrupts the power base of the bourgeois
elite but also attacks the social and economic institutions that characterize
the bourgeois order. This process involves the fusion of state and economy
and  the  integration  and homogenization of  society itself  by  managerial
forces. In the totalitarian managerial regimes, private property is virtually
abolished, and the economy is directly administered by the state; the fusion
of state and economy is literal and complete. In the managerial regimes in
which mass  organizations evolved  as  a  response to  the  emergence  and
participation of mass populations in economic and political life, and where
bourgeois  or  prescriptive elements  have  retained some  power and  offer
some restraint on the dominance of the managerial regime, private property
and economic autonomy survive to a greater and more significant degree.
Nevertheless, even in these managerial regimes, there is a close integration
of the economy and the state so that in its essential aspects it is accurate to
speak of a fusion of the two sectors. The mass organizations in the economy
cannot operate—they cannot plan for mass production, financing, research,
and marketing—without the cooperation of the state, and this cooperation
serves the interests of the managerial elite in the state, since its role in the
economy extends its power and functions. Thus, the managerial elites of the
mass corporations and the mass state do not resist, and, indeed, collaborate
to  promote, the  fusion of  the  mass  economy and  the  mass  state.  The
importance of the mass state and its activities in mass society to the mass

corporations are summarized by Galbraith, whose term “planning system”
refers to “the part of the modern bimodal economy that is dominated by the
large corporations and where these, as an essential aspect of their planning,
take markets under their control.”
## [43]
Qualified manpower is decisive for the success of the planning system. The education on
which it depends is provided mostly in the public sector of the economy. . . . The market
for the most advanced technology and that which best allows of planning is also in the
public sector. Much scientific and technical innovation comes from, or is sponsored by, the
state or by publicly supported universities and research institutions. The state regulates the
aggregate demand for the products of the planning system. This is indispensable for its
planning. And still discretely and with infirmity of intent . . . the state provides the wage
and price regulation without which prices in the planning system are unstable. . . . The
planning system, in fact, is inextricably associated with the state. In notable respects, the
mature corporation [i.e., the mass managerial corporation] is an arm of the state. And the
state, in important matters, is an instrument of the planning system.
## [44]
The participation of the state in the economy thus assists and maintains
the oligopoly that characterizes managerial capitalism, and to say that the
mass economy under the domination of the corporate giants “is inextricably
associated with the state” is virtually equivalent to what James Burnham
called the “fusion of the economy with the state”
## [45]
(even though formal
state ownership of the means of production may not evolve as Burnham
believed it would).
The principal underpinning of the fusion of state and economy in the
managerial regime lies  in  the  regulation of  aggregate demand, which
Galbraith calls “indispensable” to the corporate economy, by the state. It is
indispensable because without such  regulation, the  corporate managers
would be unable to anticipate the level of production and consumption and
the most effective use of capital.
In its absence there would be unpredictable and almost certainly large fluctuations in
demand and  therewith in  sales  and  production. Planning would be  gravely impaired;
capital and  technology would have  to  be  used  much  more  cautiously and  far  less
effectively than now. And the position of the technostructure, since it is endangered by the
failure of earnings, would be far less secure.
## [46]

The  position of  the  technostructure or  managerial elite  in  the
corporation, as  well  as  its  counterpart in  the  state,  is  enhanced by  the
regulation of  aggregate demand.  Not  only  does  the  regulatory process
involve highly technical and  specialized economic, legal,  political, and
administrative work but also regulation results in the more effective use of
capital and technology by the corporation and augments the need for and
the rewards of the managerial elite in both the state and the economy.
The  principal instruments by  which the  managerial state  regulates
aggregate demand  are  monetary and  fiscal  policy (the  corporate and
personal income tax); a high level of public expenditure by the state; labor
policy,  by  which employment and  thereby mass  consumption are
maximized; and the regulation of prices and wages. All of these activities
necessarily involve a larger, more interventionist, more powerful, and more
technically sophisticated state than the bourgeois order is able to sustain.
The entrepreneurial firms of the bourgeois economy had little need for the
regulation of aggregate demand, and, indeed, the instruments of regulation
and  the  expansion of  the  state  that  they  engender threaten the
entrepreneurial firm and its owner-operators. “The actual burden of both
corporate and  personal income  taxes  is,  in  substantial measure, on  the
entrepreneur.”
## [47]
The  managers of  the  corporation  and  the  state  do  not
themselves pay corporate income tax, and the burden of personal income
taxes on them is lighter than on the propertied elite of the bourgeoisie. The
conversion of  fiscal  policy from  a  means of  raising revenue (its  main
purpose in the bourgeois state) to a means of regulating aggregate demand
and thereby of subsidizing the managerial economy at the expense of the
bourgeois economy, and the elaboration of interventionist policies intended
to affect the level of unemployment and of wages and prices, also strike at
the  autonomy and  privatized nature of  bourgeois  economic and  social

institutions.
The managerial state is wedded to the managerial economy also through
the  whole structure of  public  regulation of  economic enterprise and
production. Product safety, occupational safety, minimum wage legislation,
legally obligatory unionization, public-health codes, minority-hiring laws,
and the regulation of banking, interstate commerce, and mass transportation
and communications create burdens that  fall  primarily on  the
entrepreneurial firms,  which lack  the  elasticity to  adjust  to  them  or  the
means to pass on to the consumer in the form of higher prices the cost
increases that are created. The managerial corporation is able to absorb
these  burdens, and,  indeed, the  burdens create  a  further need  for  more
managerial and technical functions; hence, they, too, encourage the power
of the managerial forces in the economy and state. The entrepreneurial firm
either suffers or fails due to these burdens or, if it absorbs them, becomes by
adaptation a  managerial corporation and  is  assimilated within the
managerial regime.
Other means  by  which the  state  and  economy are  fused  in  the
managerial regime include subsidization of mass corporations by the state,
either direct or indirect through fiscal privilege and government purchasing.
The latter, while not exclusively oriented toward military expenditures and
development, is intimately associated with it and has had the approval of
the managerial elite in the corporation. Galbraith notes
the strong approval which the planning system accords to military expenditures, space
exploration, support to  industrial research and  development, highways or  directly to
individual firms of the planning system when . . . they experience financial difficulty.
Military expenditures . . . are still the fulcrum on which public support to the planning
system rests.
## [48]
Alfred D. Chandler adds,

Only during and after the Second World War did the government become a major market
for industrial goods. In the postwar years, that market has been substantial, but it has been
concentrated in  a  small  number of  industries, such  as  aircraft, missiles, instruments,
communications equipment, electronic components, and  shipbuilding. .  .  .  Far  more
important to  the  spread and  continued growth of  modern [i.e.,  managerial] business
enterprise than  direct  purchases has  been  the  government’s  role  in  maintaining full
employment and high aggregate demand.
## [49]
Finally, state and economy are fused through the frequent interchange of
personnel, an interchange that has served to reduce ideological distrust of
business managers for the state.
The mobilization of the war economy [in World War II] brought corporation managers to
Washington to carry out one of the most complex pieces of economic planning in history.
That experience lessened ideological anxieties about the government’s role in stabilizing
the economy.
## [50]
The interchange of personnel takes place at the highest level of Cabinet
positions and the directorships of executive agencies, as well as at lower
levels, at which lawyers, accountants, and various kinds of specialists in the
public sector acquire more  lucrative careers in  the  business sector.
Whatever perspectives and habits of mind may separate the two sectors are
diminished by such interchanges, and the goals and interests characteristic
of the managerial capitalist and his counterpart in the managerial state are
assimilated to each other.
The  fusion of  the  economy with  the  state  in  the  managerial  regime
enables the managers in the state sector to attack the economic centers of
the bourgeois power base by undermining the productivity and autonomy of
the  entrepreneurial firm.  The  assault on  entrepreneurial capitalism also
weakens the  social institutions,  political power,  and  ideologies of  the
bourgeois elite by bringing hard property under attack from the regulatory
and  interventionist policies of  the  managerial state.  But  the  state  also
undertakes political reforms and programs of social engineering that subvert
the bourgeois elite more directly. The ostensible purpose of the political and

social reforms is  to  ameliorate  the  material condition of  the  masses,
oppressed by  bourgeois  selfishness and  parochialism, and,  indeed, this
purpose is often sincere in the minds of the managers themselves. Whether
sincere or not, however, the real effect of managerial political and social
reforms is to level bourgeois differentiations, to “liberate” the masses from
the tyranny of bourgeois or prescriptive institutions, and to homogenize the
mass population and bring it under the discipline of the mass organizations.
The alliance of mass and manager against the bourgeoisie constitutes the
political basis of managerial Caesarism.
The  economic policies of  the  managerial state  undermine the  hard
property,  class  stratification, and  the  autonomy of  the  workplace in  the
bourgeois order, but they do not directly infringe upon the bourgeois home
and family, the local community, or the bourgeois moral and social codes.
These institutions, although weakened by managerial economic policies, are
the targets of the mass educational system created by the managers in the
state  and  promoted by  the  managers in  the  economy.  The  educational
bureaucracy seeks, often deliberately and boastfully, to usurp the functions
of the bourgeois family and to instruct the juvenile bourgeois in the anti-
bourgeois  ideologies, values, and  styles of  the  managerial regime.
Managerial elements, through control or establishment of the institutions of
elementary education, child development, family planning, and social work,
are  able  to  challenge the  processes of  bourgeois  socialization and  to
establish new instruments of managerial socialization, which consolidate
managerial social disciplines over the mass population. The “therapeutic
conception of the state” serves as one of the principal rationalizations for
this managerial control of socialization. As Lasch writes,
It is in this light that we should see the school’s appropriation of many of the training
functions formerly carried out by the family, including manual training, household arts,
instruction in manners and morals, and sex education. . . . Doctors, psychiatrists, child

development experts, spokesmen for the juvenile courts, marriage counselors, leaders of
the public hygiene movement all said the same thing—usually reserving to their own
professions, however, the leading role in the care of the young.
## [51]
This aspect of the managerial assault from the state is coordinated with
the  managerial  elite  in  the  mass organizations of  culture and
communication, with which the educational bureaucracy overlaps.
Secondly, the managerial state, at least in the “soft” managerialism of
the  Western  world,  promotes political reforms aimed  at  broadening the
franchise, increasing the level of voter participation, usurping or infringing
upon  the  autonomy of  local  governments and  jurisdictions, forbidding
discrimination and  censorship at  the  local  level  (private or  public), and
overseeing the  enforcement of  these  reforms by  the  stationing of
bureaucratic officials within local jurisdictions and extending the scope of
bureaucratic powers. By  means of  such  plebiscitary,  egalitarian, and
libertarian intrusions, the managerial state breaks down the intermediary
and differentiating institutions of the bourgeois order and homogenizes and
subjugates their component members, rationalizing its extension into these
institutions through  cosmopolitan  ideological  formulas that  condemn
bourgeois  heterogeneity as  artificial and  repressive as  well  as  through
meliorist or utopian formulas. An analogous process of homogenization and
leveling takes  place  in  the  mass  economy and  is  rationalized under
managerial capitalism by the slogan that “one man’ dollar is as good as
another’.”
In those areas of society where these tactics of managerial Caesarism
have been successful, the result is tantamount to oligarchic domination of
society by the managerial elite in the state, even though democratic and
constitutional forms have been retained and even extended, and domination
is achieved largely through manipulative rather than by coercive techniques.

The substantive but informal establishment of managerial oligarchy in mass
society thus  parallels the  substantive but  informal establishment  of  a
collectivist economic order under managerial control that is achieved by the
dematerialization of property and the fusion of state and economy. Neither
the  state  nor  the  corporation would  be  able  to  maintain the  managerial
regime, however, without the skills supplied by the managerial educational
organizations and without a large degree of ideological rationalization and
integration. Both of these functions are carried out by the third sector of the
managerial regime, the mass organizations of culture and communication.

The Cultural Hegemony of the Managerial
## Regime
The managerial organizations of culture and communication consist of
those  mass-media institutions that  disseminate, restrict, or  invent facts,
ideas, values, and tastes. They include not only the media in the sense of
newspapers, periodicals, books and their publishers, advertising, film, radio,
and  television, but  also  educational and  religious institutions and  the
professional intellectual and verbalist class that is employed by them. The
revolution of  mass  and  scale  transformed such  institutions of  bourgeois
society into mass organizations, able to communicate with, and thereby to
contain and  discipline, emerging  mass  populations; this  transformation
exhibited the same pattern of elite formation found in the transformation of
the state and economy.
The revolution of mass and scale in communications began in the last
third  of  the  19th  century with  the  development of  new  technologies
conducive to  the  expansion of  the  span  of  communications and  of  the
organizations involved in them. Automatic typesetting, the manufacture of
cheap wood-pulp paper, the telephone, and modern photography allowed
for the development of mass-circulation newspapers in Western Europe and
the United States, and advances in the technologies of film and electronic
communications in the 20th century accelerated the enlargement of the span
of  communications,  the  scale  of  the  mass-media organizations, and  the
technicality and complexity of the functions these organizations performed.
The  emergence  of  mass  populations that  served as  audiences for  these
media, and the inability of the more compact and less technically advanced

cultural institutions  of  the  bourgeois  order  to  contain and  discipline
audiences of this size, created demands, particularly in Great Britain and the
United States, for new mass organizations that performed these cultural and
communicational functions.
The  organizational  enlargement  of  the  institutions of  mass
communication, as well as the highly technical nature of their functions,
encouraged the formation of a professional group of experts skilled in these
functions. The  traditional elite  of  the  bourgeois  media the  owners and
operators of small, local newspapers, publishing houses, and periodicals as
well  as  the  bourgeois intelligentsia of  the  small  colleges, schools, and
churches lacked the managerial skills necessary for the direction of mass
media and,  like  the  bourgeois  elites  in  the  economy and  the  state,  was
displaced by the new managerial groups. The latter, like their counterparts
in the mass corporation and the mass state, acquired a collective interest in
continuing to expand the size, complexity, and technicality of the mass-
media organizations, and this expansion brought the managerial elite in the
media into  conflict with,  and  served to  undermine the  institutional and
ideological fabric of, the bourgeois order.
The  intellectual and  verbalist professions are  the  most  visible
component of  the  managerial elite  of  the  mass  media and  perform the
principal social functions of the media in the managerial regime through the
formulation and dissemination of the ideological defenses of the regime and
the development and transmission of the managerial skills on which the
elite depends for the direction and operation of mass organizations in the
economy and state as well as in the media. The intellectual and verbalist
professions constitute the  intelligentsia of  the  managerial regime and
consist of the class of persons who make their living by writing, speaking,

researching, thinking, and communicating. They include the academics and
research staffs  of  universities and  foundations, literary and  aesthetic
intellectuals, actors and  entertainers, artists, scientists, teachers,
broadcasters, journalists, clergymen, and lawyers. The members of these
intellectual and verbalist professions are directly dependent on the mass
media for their livelihoods, status, power, and functions in mass society, and
they share a common interest in the continuing enlargement of the mass
organizations of culture and communication and the extension of the social
functions of  these  organizations. The  managerial intelligentsia also
participates in the direction and operation of the mass organizations of the
economy and the state and depends on these organizations for economic
and  political functions and  for  material rewards and  power through
subsidization, tax  exemption, grants, and  endowments. The  managerial
intelligentsia is  thus  closely integrated and  interdependent with  the
managerial elite  as  a  whole and  constitutes an  integral part  of  the
managerial apparatus of power in mass society.
The  mass  media of  managerial  society serve  two  general functions
within the managerial regime. They transmit and inculcate the ideology of
the regime as a means of rationalizing its structure and the interests of its
elite and articulate challenges to the bourgeois ideologies. Secondly, they
develop and  transmit, through educational and  research institutions, the
body of managerial and technical skills on which mass organizations and
their  elites  depend. These functions serve to  integrate the  mass
organizations of culture and communication with the mass organizations of
state and economy. The managerial state and corporation depend on the
skills  transmitted by  the  mass  educational organizations and  on  the
legitimization provided by the ideological formulations of the media, and
managerial capitalism in  particular depends on  the  mass  advertising

designed and carried out by the media. Thus, each sector of the managerial
elite is dependent on and fused with the others, and the elite of each sector
reinforces and protects the interests of the elites in the other sectors.
The mass media are able to control, discipline, and integrate the mass
population because of  the  way  in  which they  communicate with  their
audiences. They generally lack the coercive sanctions of the state and the
power to  grant  or  withhold rewards that  the  economic organizations
possess; and precisely because of their immense scale, they lack the ability
to create the personal and informal disciplines that characterize bourgeois
and prescriptive institutions. Only by the sophisticated development of the
techniques of  mass  communication can  these  organizations exist,  create
loyalties among their members (whether they are formal members or simply
members of an audience and whether the audience is compact or dispersed),
and communicate facts, ideas, and values to them. Despite the lack of the
material sanctions of force and reward by the mass media organizations, the
use of the techniques of mass communications constitutes one of the most
important forms of social power in mass society. Without these techniques
and the organizations that use them, the integration of mass society by the
managerial regime would be impossible. As Dennis Wrong notes,
Inequality of the means of persuasion is even more evident when we consider the mass
media in  modern societies. The  owners or  controllers of  printing presses, radio  and
television transmitters,  loudspeakers and  amplifying equipment possess enormous
persuasive advantages over the individual citizen. He cannot argue back but can only
switch off the TV or radio, or refuse to buy a particular newspaper, and under conditions of
modern urban life he cannot avoid completely becoming a member of a “captive audience”
exposed to the mass persuasions of those who control the ubiquitous communications
media. The technological revolution in communications has created new and complex
instruments of persuasion, access to which constitutes a vitally important power resource.
## [52]
The consolidation of managerial control of the mass organizations of
culture and communication enables the emergent elite to achieve what the

Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci called “cultural hegemony”: “the
permeation throughout civil society—including a whole range of structures
and activities like trade unions, schools, the churches, and the family—of
an entire system of values, attitudes, beliefs, morality, etc. that is in one way
or another supportive of the established order and the class interests that
dominate it.”
## [53]
Cultural hegemony allows the managerial elite to create and
manipulate “consent” on a mass level as well as to challenge bourgeois
cultural dominance and discipline the mass audiences of the organizations
of culture and communication with a minimal reliance on coercion.
The conflict between the mass media and the bourgeois order takes both
organizational as  well  as  ideological and  cultural forms. Since  media
institutions are often organized as corporate structures, the conflict often
takes  place  as  the  competition  between the  mass  corporation and  the
entrepreneurial firm  (the  form  in  which bourgeois  media are  typically
organized). Giant newspaper chains and publishing houses buy up or drive
out small ones; giant film companies or broadcasting networks take over
small competitors and independents. As in the conflict in the economy, the
tendency to conglomeration in the media undermines the autonomy of the
bourgeois power base. A similar process of conglomeration occurs with the
mass educational and religious organizations. Small schools and colleges
cannot easily compete against the  “multiversity” in  attracting faculty,
students, grants, and  financial contributions, and  the  centralization of
attractive facilities in a single mass educational organization enables it to
absorb others and to dominate cultural and intellectual life. At the lower
levels of schooling, mass public education has tended to replace or absorb
private schools and academies.
Among religious institutions, there is  a  similar tendency to

conglomeration as  mass churches, using mass communications,
sophisticated administrative and  financial skills, and  technical secular
services and functions, replace or absorb the small community churches that
characterized the religious culture of the bourgeois order. “When we speak
of organization in the field of religion,” wrote sociologist Gibson Winter in
the 1960s,
we refer primarily to the coordination of activities, the introduction of rational systems of
accounting, the use of functionally specialized staffs, the application of objective criteria to
gauge performance, and the designation of specific goals to be served by functional units
within the enterprise.
## [54]
The  proliferation of  such  managerial elements within churches has
radically altered the practice of organized religion in the 20th century. “Our
century,” writes Herbert Wallace Schneider,
has created a number of religious societies whose outward appurtenances resemble the
office buildings of big business more than they do church buildings. . . . During the last
decades the work of the American religious bodies has become so specialized, organized,
and practical, that the very life of religion seems to be shifting from worship to “service”
and from altar to office.
## [55]
Under the impact of the revolution of mass and scale, and the mobility,
urbanization, and  secularization that  accompany it,  mass  churches with
expanded services and secularized functions and doctrines tend to attract
larger  congregations  and  to  replace the  bourgeois  churches that  remain
wedded to  traditional religious styles and  values; the  leadership that
emerges in the secularized mass churches is to a large degree managerial
rather  than  bourgeois  in  nature. Thus,  Winter  found  in  a  study  of  the
“organizational revolution” among Protestant churches,
Protestant organization has brought professional, managerial personnel into the religious
bureaucracy.  .  .  .  Large-scale, highly rationalized bureaucracies cannot operate on  a
familistic basis. They require skilled managerial personnel who can decide on objective
criteria about  programs and  advancement. This  creates a  conflict between the
“organization men” and the constituency. . . . Organizational staff encounter this strain in
local churches as the tension between cosmopolitan and local interests. Organization of

religious activities on a centralized basis favors a cosmopolitan type who can move from
one organization to another; his skills are detachable; they can be used in any comparable
organization with minor adjustment. Local congregations are interested in a man with local
pastoral concern; the large organization turns the pastor’s attention to the organizational
demands—increased membership and fund-raising.
## [56]
The ideological and cultural conflict between the mass media and the
bourgeois order parallels their organizational conflict. The compact scale,
localized span,  and  personalized and  informal social and  political
disciplines of  the  bourgeois  order  allowed a  high  degree of  social  and
cultural differentiation within it,  and  this  heterogeneity  reinforced the
dominance of  the  bourgeois  elite  and  its  informal apparatus of  power
through discrimination on the basis of class and property, regional origin,
race and sex, and moral behavior. Although there were distinct limits to the
diversity and pluralism of bourgeois societies, the bourgeois elite could not
impose uniformity on those subject to it without constructing more formal
and  universal political institutions and  thereby substantially altering or
threatening its own apparatus of power and the informal and particularized
institutions that upheld it.
The differentiated nature of the bourgeois social order constrains the
development of mass    media because the latter cannot communicate with the
diversified audiences contained in bourgeois institutions. The very nature of
mass  media  involves a  uniformity of  content and  style  in  the
communications disseminated through them, and in order to receive the
uniform contents of mass communications, their audience must be uniform
in  the  values, tastes, manners,  body  of  knowledge, and  aspirations it
harbors. Thus,  the  mass  media must  break  down  the  social, economic,
moral, intellectual, and emotional distinctions that diversify the bourgeois
order  and  promote the  homogenization of  bourgeois  society to  create  a
uniform mass audience susceptible to  the  discipline of  mass

communications.
The  process of  homogenization is  rationalized by  a  cosmopolitan
ideology that  regards the  social and  cultural differentiations of  the
bourgeois order as backward, artificial, and repressive. The tendency of the
mass  media to  homogenization and  the  cosmopolitan ideology that
promotes it parallels and reinforces the cultural and ideological tendencies
of the managerial corporations in their promotion of mass hedonism and
cosmopolitanism and  of  the  managerial state  in  its meliorism,
cosmopolitanism, and centralization. The tendency to homogenization of
the  audiences of  mass  media is  evident in  mass  advertising.  Mass
consumption presupposes a  uniformity of  wants on  the  part  of  all
consumers, and  advertising must  instill  in  the  consumer a  demand for
uniform products. Uniformity of demand presupposes a uniformity in the
character of the consumers that is unnecessary and virtually impossible in
the  smaller scale  economy of  the  bourgeois  order.  The  differentiated
products of  localized bourgeois enterprises cannot be  marketed to
consumers far removed from the place of production and different in tastes,
knowledge, manners, and needs from the consumers of the local market.
The same homogenizing trend is apparent in the communications of all
mass media. National news and entertainment media present the same body
of information and amusement to all places and levels of society, whether
the medium is electronic or printed. In the mass educational organizations,
uniformity of textbooks, teaching methods, and curricula homogenize the
intellectual development of  the  mass  population, and  the  bureaucratized
academic societies and  teachers’  unions that  preside over  and  design
educational techniques encourage this  trend. In  the  mass  religious
organizations, the  same  tendency is  apparent in  the  amalgamation of

theological differences in the form of ecumenism and in the secularization
of church concerns in the form of technical secular functions. Daniel Bell
has commented on the cultural and religious effects of the revolution of
mass and scale:
The enlargement of a social sphere leads to greater interaction, and this interaction in turn
leads  to  specialization, complementary relations, and  structural differentiation. But  in
culture the increase in interaction, owing to the breakdown of segmented societies or of
parochial cultures, leads to syncretism the mingling of strange gods, as in the time of
Constantine, or the mélange of cultural artifacts in modern art (or even in the living rooms
of middle-class professional families). Syncretism is the jumbling of styles in modern art,
which absorbs African masks or  Japanese prints  into  its  modes of  depicting spatial
perceptions; or  the  merging  of  Oriental  and  Western religions, detached from  their
histories, in a modern meditative consciousness.
## [57]
The  nature of  mass communications, the  centralization and
bureaucratization of  the  production of  what  is  communicated and  the
technical nature of its production, reinforce and encourage the syncretistic
homogenization of  mass  society,  undermining the  particularist and
differentiated structures of the bourgeois order, detaching the loyalties of its
members, and  disciplining them within the  networks of  mass
communications. The  homogenization and  syncretism promoted by  the
mass media not only serve to undermine bourgeois institutions and elites to
the advantage of managerial elites in the mass organizations of culture and
communication, as well as in the mass corporations and mass state, but also
correspond to  the  universalist and  cosmopolitan formulas of  managerial
ideology, by which the behavior and values of mass society are rationalized
and which also serve the interests of the managerial corporations and the
managerial state. The homogenization of the mass population as political
participants, consumers, and audience creates a uniform collective identity
susceptible to the manipulative disciplines of the mass organizations and
their elites.

The  formulation  and  inculcation of  the  managerial ideology is  a
principal function of the media of mass communication in integrating mass
society under managerial dominance and  a  principal instrument of
managerial cultural hegemony. The emergence of mass populations in the
course of  the  revolution of  mass  and  scale  required not  only  an
organizational response in the form of new manipulative disciplines but also
the development of new values and patterns of behavior on the part of the
population that  reflect the  functioning of  mass  organizations and  the
interests of  their  managerial elites.  The  new  patterns of  behavior are
themselves institutionalized through rationalizations articulated by the mass
media in the form of a coherent ideology. The managerial intelligentsia
formulates the  ideology of  the  regime as  a  coherent rationalization and
expression of the functional needs of the mass corporations, the mass state,
and  the  mass  media in  the  economy,  political order,  and  culture of
managerial society. Thus, the economy of mass consumption is rationalized
through the  formulation and  dissemination of  an  ideology and  ethic  of
hedonism that  legitimizes the  gratification of  appetites and  material
aspirations through the consumption of goods and services produced by the
mass economic organizations. Similarly, the bureaucratic state involved in
the engineering of political, economic, and social institutions through the
application of managerial skills requires the formulation of a meliorist or
utopian ideology that  legitimizes the  functions and  power of  the
bureaucratic elite of the state. Both the state and the mass corporations, as
well as the mass organizations of culture and communication, also require
the  formulation of  an  ideology and  ethic  of  cosmopolitanism that
rationalizes the  abandonment or  diminution of  political, economic, and
social and  cultural differentiations. A  fundamental element of  the
managerial ideology and  ethic  is  its  presupposition of scientism, “the

premise,” as William H.  Whyte described it, “that with the same techniques
that have worked in the physical sciences, we can eventually create an exact
science of man,” and which he saw as a fundamental assumption of the
“organization man” and as “essentially a utopian rather than a technical
idea.”
## [58]
The scientistic premises of the managerial ideology and ethic offer
a rationalization for the application of managerial skills and techniques to
political, economic, and social and cultural arrangements and for the power
and preeminence of the managerial elite, proficient in the application of
these skills and techniques, as a whole.
The ideological needs of the interdependent sectors of the managerial
regime thus reinforce each other and reflect the interests of the managerial
elites  in  the  mass  organizations,  and  just  as  the  mass  structures of  the
managerial regime are integrated with each other, so also are their basic
ideological themes and values interlinked. The result is the synthesis of
hedonistic, meliorist and  utopian,  cosmopolitan, and  scientistic  elements
into a popularized ideology and ethic that seek to replace the bourgeois
ideologies and ethic as the fundamental public orthodoxy and moral code of
managerial society.  The  underlying myth  or  idea  of  the  managerial
orthodoxy is that human potential is most nearly fulfilled in collective or
mass  activities that  reflect the  transcendence of  or  emancipation from
traditional, particularistic, and  separative identities, loyalties, and
individualist selfishness through cosmopolitan interaction, liberation from
obsolete and  restrictive morality through a  hedonistic and  eudaemonian
ethic,  and  the  amelioration of  society,  man,  and  the  world  through the
meliorist or  utopian engineering of  social, economic, and  political
arrangements by the manipulative application of managerial skills.
The  managerial ideology thus  synthesizes and  unifies the  particular

functions of the mass organizations and reflects, unifies, and rationalizes the
interests of  their  managerial elites. It  provides a  reasonably  coherent
worldview for managerial society, an intellectual and moral predicate on
which the  functioning of  the  regime and  the  behavior of  its  mass
populations may be justified, and a defense of the predominance of the
managerial elite over its bourgeois rivals. The ideology is sufficiently loose,
variable, and flexible to perform its functions under different circumstances
and  in  diverse regions and  countries of  the  world  and  is  known  under
different labels.  In  the  “hard” managerial regimes of  the  fascist and
communist type, however, the elements of the ideological synthesis, the
synthesis itself, and the structure and functioning of the regimes are quite
different from those of the “soft” managerial regimes of the West.
Although the  managerial media perform their  ideological functions
principally by popularizing and inculcating the managerial ideology and
ethic among their mass audiences, these functions also include their role in
accommodating the different sectors of the managerial regime to each other
and acting as a cohesive agent in integrating these sectors in a common
purpose and  a  common bond. This  role  also  involves a  critical or
adversarial relationship to the managerial elite of the other sectors as well
as to the bourgeois order. The function of their adversarial relationship is
not  to  weaken the  managerial state  and  economy but  to  accelerate the
expansion of mass and scale and intensify the managerial dominance that
expansion generates. The  managerial intelligentsia thus  serves as  a
vanguard of  the  regime and  of  the  continuing development of  its
functioning and dominance. The real hostility of the mass media is directed
not at mass society or the managerial regime but at the remnants of the
bourgeois order and the persistence of its elite, institutions, and values.

The managerial intelligentsia also maintain an interest in preserving and
expanding an “open society,” cultural “pluralism,” and unrestricted freedom
of expression, which reflect their adversarial role as well as the specific
interests of  their  professional autonomy and  the  enhancement  of  their
professional rewards and  status. The  “pluralism” and  “openness” they
demand consists largely in the dissemination of anti-bourgeois ideas and
values and is consistent with the anti-bourgeois homogenization of society
and culture under managerial discipline. They do not significantly challenge
the  bases  of  the  managerial regime or  the  premises and  values of
managerial ideology, and their adversarial role does not weaken the regime
but serves to discipline it within the constraints of managerial orthodoxy
and  to  reduce the  influence within  it  of  persistent bourgeois  and  anti-
managerial elements.
Mass educational and religious organizations in particular make use of
managerial ideologies to rationalize their expansion in scale and power.
Bourgeois schools and universities, limited in scale and number of students,
facilities, and academic disciplines, were among the principal institutions of
the bourgeois order by which the values and styles of the bourgeois elite
were transmitted and upheld. Thus, such educational institutions enforced
bourgeois codes of conduct and deportment and provided an environment in
which young bourgeoisie were  assimilated into  the  moral and  social
framework of  the  bourgeois  order.  The  personnel in  such  educational
institutions both faculty and students were drawn from the bourgeois elites
and were homogeneous with respect to their social, racial, intellectual, and
moral backgrounds. Such schools and universities could not expand in scale
or  contain more  students, faculty,  and  facilities without diluting their
bourgeois nature and assimilating elements from outside the bourgeois elite.

The  main  precipitant of  the  emergence of  managerial elites  within
institutions of  higher education  was,  as  in  other  organizations, the
revolution of mass and scale in the population included within them.
Around the turn of the century, as the population of colleges and universities began to
climb, it became increasingly necessary for specialized officials to handle applications for
admission and  other  aspects of  student affairs.  The  entrance of  women into  higher
education in ever-increasing numbers added to the responsibilities of these officials. With
the growth in student body there came an increase in the size of faculties, as well as a vast
expansion in the scope of budgets and physical facilities. All these developments further
accentuated the need for administrators on college campuses. University presidents could
no longer handle by themselves managerial responsibilities as wideranging as those they
were now asked to undertake.
## [59]
This expansion in the size of the institutions of higher education, which
accrued to the material advantage of managerial and verbalist-intellectual
groups within them by increasing the material resources at their disposal
and their own professional and social status and influence, involved the
erosion of the traditional moral, religious, and social functions of bourgeois
education as well as the decline of traditional curricula and an emphasis on
new disciplines in the physical and social sciences, professional studies, and
programs in  technical and  applied  subjects. The  dependence of  mass
universities upon  large  student bodies and  the  increasing financial and
physical assets to  accommodate them  contributed to  the  gradual
abandonment of bourgeois codes of conduct and deportment, the erosion of
traditional intellectual disciplines, the  adulteration of  academic
requirements, the guaranteeing of academic success, and the multiplication
of  academic disciplines, faculty,  students, and  functions. The  need  to
assimilate mass student bodies, drawn from strata outside and often hostile
to  the  bourgeois  elites  and  their  values, forced the  mass  educational
organizations to  abandon enforcement of  bourgeois  social and  moral
ideologies and to express and make use of managerial ideology and its
ethic. The mass educational organizations, while expanding their functions,

intensified their internal disciplinary functions through efforts to inculcate
the managerial ideology in their mass audiences and to socialize them in
accordance with the managerial ethic.
Similarly,  mass  religious organizations expanded by  increasingly
abandoning the traditional functions of religion and adopting new functions,
based on communications skills and managerial techniques that permitted
and  encouraged their  expansion. The  organizational enlargement of
religious institutions involved significant changes in the content of their
religious doctrine away from the concerns of bourgeois religion and toward
the  secularized and meliorist concerns of  managerial religion. The
individualistic piety  of  bourgeois  religion in  America served  as  an
ideological support of the bourgeois regime. But, wrote Will Herberg,
As American social life became more complex and as Protestantism itself became more
and more an institutional reflection of certain strata of middle-class America, the religious
individualism remaining from frontier religion began to serve as a means of ignoring and
evading the social problems that were arising in the New America of big cities and modern
industry.
## [60]
The expansion of the scale and functions of religious institutions in the
late 19th century was a response to the revolution of mass and scale in
social and economic life.
In the 1880s, the “institutional church” emerged, fostered particularly by
Episcopalians and Congregationalists, with the purpose of providing centers
of culture, recreation, and religious education for the urban poor who were
now  inhabiting the  sections of  the  city  in  which these  churches  were
located. Settlement  houses were  part  of  the  same  program,  though
increasingly they came to be operated under secular auspices. But the most
significant effort of American Protestantism to meet the challenge of the
new America was the “social gospel” and the social action agencies that

went along with it.
## [61]
Sociologist Gibson Winter  found that  “the  three  faiths  [American
Protestantism, Catholicism, and  Judaism] have  developed rather  similar
bureaucratic structures,” and that
Common features of the American situation have provided an external principle for this
organizational development of the faiths. Rapid urbanization introduced complex problems
of planning and communications. The diversification of educational, welfare, occupational,
and  residential  spheres of  activity called  for  a  considerable diversification within the
religious organizations. Although each  faith  community shaped its  own  pattern of
organization according  to  the  dominant principle of  its  own  ethos  .  .  .  the  emerging
bureaucratic structures  were  very  similar.  This  is  the  most  striking feature in  the
organizational development of the major faiths in the United States.
## [62]
In mass religion, profound religious emotions and experiences and the
complexities and subtleties of theology, ethics, and sacred history cannot
effectively be communicated or contained. Mass religion is promoted by the
secular appeals that the managerial elite of the mass churches is skilled in
disseminating, and the secularization of mass religion involves the mass
religious organizations in  implementing and  communicating “secular
salvations” that incorporate the cosmopolitan, hedonistic, scientistic, and
meliorist and utopian elements of managerial ideology. “Modern societies,”
writes Daniel Bell, “have substituted utopia for religion utopia not as a
transcendental ideal,  but  one  to  be  realized through history (progress,
rationality, science) with the nutrients of technology and the midwifery of
revolution.”
## [63]
Of all the mass media of culture and communication, however, the most
necessary for the managerial regime are the mass educational organizations.
Not only does mass schooling provide ideological and communicational
integration for mass society, but also it is through these organizations that
the specialized skills of management and technical expertise are acquired;
and the elites of all the sectors of the regime could not exist or hold power

without such skills. It is an imperative of the managerial regime, therefore,
that  the  mass  educational organizations be  integrated or  fused  with  the
managerial state and the managerial corporation, and this fusion takes place
primarily through what  Bell  and  Kevin P.  Phillips call  the  “knowledge
sector” or “knowledge industry.”
## [64]
John  Kenneth Galbraith suggests that  the  reliance of  the  managerial
economy on  education has  revolutionized the  traditionally hostile
relationship between business and the intelligentsia:
With the rise of the technostructure, relations between those associated with economic
enterprise and  the  educational and  scientific estate have  undergone  a  radical
transformation. There is no longer an abrupt conflict in motivation. Like the educational
and scientific estate, the technostructure is no longer exclusively responsive to pecuniary
motivation. Both  see  themselves as  identified  with  social  goals  or  with  organizations
serving social purposes. And both, it may be assumed, seek to adapt social goals to their
own. If there is a difference, it is not in the motivational system but in the goals.
## [65]
Although there  remain tensions between the  mass  educational
organizations and  the  mass  corporations (as  there  are  between the
corporation and the mass state and as there always are between the sectors
of any elite), the dependence of the managerial economy on mass education
and research, the very large rewards available to educational organizations
from corporations, and the interchange of personnel at various levels of
both sectors result in the effective fusion or integration of the two. The mass
economy is also fused with the mass state, and thus the state is by this fact
also  wedded to  mass  education. But  the  fusion of  the  state  and  the
educational system is more direct. Mass education at the lower as well as at
the higher levels is largely financed through public funds, and research and
development contracts between state  and  university and  research
organizations make education a direct appendage of the mass state. The
technical functions of the state, furthermore, demand a strong infusion of
skills and expertise from the mass academy and the development of the

skills and expertise of the professional bureaucratic elite of the state. The
fusion of  state,  economy,  and  education becomes even  more  significant
when it is understood that the modern university has acquired a virtual
cultural and intellectual monopoly in mass society. “The habitat, manners,
and  idiom  of  intellectuals have  been  transformed within the  past  fifty
years,” wrote Russell Jacoby in 1987,
Younger intellectuals no longer need or want a larger public; they are almost exclusively
professors. Campuses are  their  homes; colleagues their  audiences; monographs and
specialized journals their media. Unlike past intellectuals they situate themselves within
fields and disciplines—for good reason. Their jobs, advancement, and salaries depend on
the  evaluation  of  specialists, and  this  dependence affects  the  issues  broached and  the
language employed.
## [66]
Daniel Bell remarks that “The universities have become the dominant
force in the American cultural world today: many novelists, composers,
painters, and critics find their havens in the far-flung universities, and many
of the major literary and cultural quarterlies are edited there.”
## [67]
Thus, the
fusion of state, economy, and education is in fact a fusion of state, economy,
and  culture,  and  all  three  reflect the  interests and  imperatives of  mass
organizations and the managerial elite.
Given this  fusion and  mutual interdependence, the  adversarial
relationship between the mass media and the other sectors of the managerial
regime cannot but  be  limited. Whatever serious dissidence is  generated
within the mass organizations of culture and communication is either stifled
or absorbed by the capacity of mass society to neutralize and assimilate it.
Cultural hegemony  allows the  manipulative rather than  the  coercive
suppression of  dissent. Dissidents,  if  they  are  not  violent and  do  not
penetrate too  far  into  the  morphology and  dynamics of  the  managerial
regime, are  not  punished, censored, or  lynched but  rewarded, and  their
dissent becomes another product for  mass  consumption. The  successful

integration of  the  sectors of  the  managerial regime, including culture,
means the imposition of a uniformity of ideas, values, tastes, and styles,
alleviated only by trivial fashions, novelties, and exotica generated by the
media and the imperatives of mass production and consumption. The real
hostility of the regime is reserved only for the remnants of the bourgeois
and prescriptive orders that refuse to die and continue to resist and for those
forms of rebellion that cannot be assimilated. So far from promoting or
extending the pluralism and heterogeneity that characterized the bourgeois
order, the imperative of the managerial regime is to extinguish it under the
discipline of managerial homogenization.
The acquisition of organizational control by managerial elites within the
mass organizations of culture and communication and their adaptation to
the needs of the managerial regime was generally not advanced in Western
societies until  the  middle and  later  part  of  the  20th  century.  Only  after
World War II did the dramatic expansion of educational institutions, the
professionalization of the educational, intellectual, and verbalist classes, the
technological and organizational advances of the communications industry,
and the fusion of the mass organizations of culture and communication with
the managerial state and economy take place fully. Until that time, the role
of the mass media in formulating and disseminating managerial ideology
and challenging the ideology and ethic of the bourgeois order was limited,
as  was  their  role  in  providing the  managerial skills  on  which the
bureaucratic and  corporate elites  depend. Hence, the  dissemination of
cosmopolitan ideas and values (as well as of other elements of managerial
ideology), and  the  challenge to  bourgeois  particularism and  ascetic
individualism, were restricted, though present within a growing number of
mass media and their elites.

These restrictions limited the homogenization of the mass population
that  the  media were  able  to  implement. The  inability of  the  regime to
integrate the  mass  population within a  homogeneous mass  audience
susceptible to ideological and behavioral manipulation by the mass cultural
organizations served to constrain the managerial regime and allowed for the
persistence of bourgeois political and ideological opposition to it. In the
absence of  adequate ideological  discipline, policies and  actions of  the
regime that  presupposed cosmopolitan rationalizations (internationalism,
racial desegregation, and political centralization) were often successfully
resisted. With the organizational and technological advances of the mass
organizations of  culture and  communication, however,  and  with  the
integration of these structures with the regime in state and corporation, the
eradication of  pre-managerial differentiations, the  homogenization of  a
mass audience, and the inculcation of a cosmopolitan ideology and ethic
have  become more  feasible. Indeed, the  tendency of  the  managerial
intelligentsia, equipped with the organizational and technological resources
of the post-World War II era, has been toward the assertion of its dominance
within the  regime and  the  subordination of  the  elites  of  the  mass
corporation and mass state to its interests and aspirations.

The Suicide of the Bourgeoisie
The revolution of mass and scale at the end of the 19th and beginning of
the 20th centuries brought about changes that bourgeois political, economic,
and social institutions could not contain or control. Only mass organizations
could discipline  the  vast increases in  human mass and the  exponential
enlargement of  social interaction, and only professionally trained and
specialized personnel could operate and direct these organizations. In
assuming the functions of operation and direction, the groups that possessed
these skills the managerial elites of the mass organizations also took control
of  them  and acquired economic, political, and cultural and social power
over mass  society.  Possessing similar interests in  each sector of  society,
they integrated and fused with each other against the bourgeois elites and
their order. The revolution of mass and scale thus challenged the bourgeois
order and disrupted its institutions, but it did not end that order. Rather, it
generated forces that accelerated the organizational enlargement of society
and which found their interests and imperatives in total conflict with those
of the bourgeois elite.
The emergent managerial groups could not have displaced the bourgeois
elite had they not assimilated parts of  it  within their own structure of
interests and aspirations. When bourgeois elements acquired  managerial
skills, their use of and dependence on such skills tended only to transform
them into managers and not  to  enable them to  compete more  effectively
with the  new elites. By  coming to  depend on  managerial skills for  their
livelihoods, power, and status, bourgeois elements acquired the economic,
political, and social interests of  the managers and were impelled to
encourage the expansion of  mass organizations, the abandonment of
bourgeois ideology,  the subversion of  the bourgeois order,  and the

formation of   the managerial regime. Even when metamorphosed
bourgeoisie continued to  mouth the slogans and clichés of  bourgeois
ideology,  and even when they really believed in  this ideology,  their
positions and functions in  the managerial apparatus induced them to
advance the interests and ideology of the managerial elite.
One reason why the  conflict between the  managerial and bourgeois
regimes is  not  more clearly perceived is  that the  revolution of  mass and
scale was itself a  product of  bourgeois society.  The industrialization,
population growth, urbanization, and increase of production that constituted
the industrial revolution of  the late 18th and 19th centuries were the
preconditions of the further revolution of mass and scale that followed. The
democratic revolution  that  paralleled the  industrial revolution established
the ideological and institutional premises of the managerial ideologies that
flourished in  the  20th century.  Both the  industrial and the  democratic
revolutions were the work of the European and American bourgeoisie, and
the immediate effect of both revolutions was the political, economic, social,
and cultural dominance of bourgeois elites.
Bourgeois dominance, however,  ultimately could not  prevail over the
new forces that the bourgeois revolution generated. The historian Charles
Morazé comments at the conclusion of his study of the bourgeois order of
the 19th century on the self-destructive dynamic of that order:
[J]ust as  the  privileged  few of  the ancien régime  had  been  unable to  gain control of
scientific progress, so  the  middle classes of  Victorian Europe were unable to  retain the
monopoly of its benefits for long. Society underwent a series of structural changes, as a
result of  which the  middle classes were swamped by  a  rising tide of  technicians drawn
from the ranks of the people and educated in the new schools. . . . It was not long before
they [the middle classes] began to  feel  uneasy at  the growth of  technocracies and
socialisms and the  rise of  new continents. Soon they were being gradually deprived  of
their power and by exactly the same forces that they had themselves employed to despoil
the privileged of a previous generation by belief in progress and respect for its laws.
## [68]

However uneasy the bourgeois elites began to feel about the new forces
that their  very success had unleashed, it  is  not  clear that most  bourgeois
understood these forces or  how to  resist them. Hence, they often joined
with, supported, and encouraged the new technocracies, the new ideologies,
the new masses, and the new organizations that challenged them and their
civilization. Whatever the oppressiveness, narrowness, selfishness, and
weaknesses of  the  bourgeois order,  its  most fatal flaw consisted in  its
inability to recognize and defend itself against the threats that it generated.
“Elites,” wrote Vilfredo Pareto, “usually end up  committing suicide.”
## [69]
Perhaps all  human societies exhibit, or  develop, similar flaws and
vulnerabilities, or perhaps the managerial regime does. If so, then it too may
face challenges from the forces that it breeds, and, like the bourgeois order
that preceded it,  fail  to  recognize the  threat and to  mobilize the  will and
resources to meet it.

## The Managerial Elite: Unity And
## Dominance
OceanofPDF.com

The Characteristics of Elite Rule
The belief that professional managers have displaced owners or
entrepreneurs as  the dominant element in  the control and direction of  the
modern corporation is commonly accepted by many economists and social
scientists, although acceptance is not universal. The extension of the theory
of managerial control to mass organizations other than the corporation—to
the mass state and the mass organizations of culture and communication, for
example—is far more controversial, as are the political and cultural
implications of  this extension. Perhaps the most controversial part of  the
theory of  the managerial revolution is  its claim that a  managerial elite in
state, economy, and culture holds political, economic, and cultural power in
the United States. The criticism of this claim is  based in  part on the
alternative theories of social and political stratification that have prevailed
in  the United States as  well as  on a  number of  ambiguities and  erroneous
concepts found in the original formulation of the theory of the managerial
revolution by James Burnham and in  discussions of  the theory  by later
writers. These ambiguities and errors, however, are not essential to the main
body of  the theory.  The errors can be  corrected, the ambiguities  clarified,
and the theory reformulated in  a  way that preserves its framework but
avoids the weaknesses that have for long been associated with it and have
prevented an appreciation of its value for explaining the social and political
forces of the 20th century.
In order for a social group to constitute an elite, it must be both unified
and dominant. A  group may be said to  be unified  if  its members act
similarly with respect to their interests, and it may be said to be dominant if

it is able to make its interests prevail over those of other groups most of the
time. If, therefore, the members of a group behave similarly with respect to
their interests and are able to make their interests prevail over those of other
groups most of the time, then the group constitutes an elite. The unity of an
elite derives from and presupposes not only a body of shared interests but
also some consciousness that such common interests exist and that those
who share them (the members of  the elite) should undertake coordinated
action to  pursue them. Unity,  that is, involves not only the “objective”
existence of  common interests but also the “subjective” existence of  an
awareness of these interests among those who share them. Political scientist
James H. Meisel emphasized subjective unity as an essential characteristic
of an elite. “We shall assume,” he wrote,
that all the members of  an elite are alert to  their group interest or  interests; that this
alertness is  in  turn caused or  affected by a  sense, implicit or  explicit, of  group or  class
solidarity; and last, that this solidarity is expressed in a common will to action. . . . To put
it in a facile formula, all elites shall be credited here with what we should like to call the
three Cs: group consciousness, coherence, and conspiracy.
## [70]
The subjective unity of  an elite  is  ordinarily institutionalized, and the
tendency of individuals with similar objective interests to behave similarly
is  reinforced, through an ideology  or set of ideas and formulas that
identifies its objective interests and rationalizes, communicates, and
integrates the pursuit of  these interests. Subjective unity is  reinforced also
through institutions such as schools, churches, clubs, political groups,
professional organizations, and  patterns of association that facilitate
communications within the elite as well as ways in which its members may
identify their common interests,  collaborate in  pursuing them, and ensure
that their interests prevail over those of other social groups. The means of
identifying and communicating the interests of the elite, however, is almost
never explicit and is  almost always symbolized, coded, or otherwise

disguised (as the interests, e.g., of  “mankind,” the nation, the race; as  the
natural order of  things, historical destiny,  or  the will of  God), even to  the
members of the elite itself, within the ideology, formulas, or myths that the
elite uses.
In  common usage the term “interest”  is  generally taken to  mean an
activity or relationship that is beneficial, especially in a material sense, to a
particular group or individual. More narrowly, an “interest” usually refers to
an economic or  political interest and is  contrasted with less material or
tangible considerations—of religion, ethical values, or ideas, for example—
that may  also be  subjectively important to  a  group or  individual. The late
Richard Hofstadter,  discussing the historical thought of Charles Beard,
noted the analytical dangers of facile dichotomies between tangible
“economic” interests and intangible “ideas.”
Economic interests as such are not always obvious or given; they have
to be conceptualized and made the object of calculations or guesses. They
have to  be weighed against other kinds of interests, sentiments, and
aspirations. Ideas themselves constitute interests, in that they are
repositories of past interests and that they present to us claims of their own
that have to be satisfied.
## [71]
If  the primary meaning of “interest” concerns material or tangible
benefits, then interests are still not entirely distinct from intangible or
subjective beliefs, without which objective or material interests could not be
perceived or  the means and costs of  pursuing them calculated. The more
abstract values and norms of a group or individual, formed from historical,
religious, philosophical, ethical, scientific, mythological, ethnic, and
cultural elements, may inform the group or individual of what resources of
wealth and power it should pursue, what it should do with them, how much

of them it should seek to obtain, what means it should use to obtain them,
and what or how much it should give up or expend in obtaining them. Such
values and norms may also define or identify the group itself as a distinct
entity.  The preservation of the content of a  cultural and conceptual
apparatus—ideas, values, norms, aspirations, traditions, myths, etc.—by
which a  group or  individual is  informed of  its material interests and the
means of pursuing them is no less (and perhaps more of) an interest than the
more narrow material interests themselves and cannot be separated from
them. The ability of  an elite to  perceive its interests and to  make them
prevail over those of other groups thus involves preserving the intangible or
“subjective” factors that define and unify the elite as a distinct group in the
first place and which serve to  identify the more tangible or  “objective”
interests in such forms as wealth, weapons, and physical assets. The unity
of an elite is itself an interest that the elite must preserve and pursue if it is
to remain dominant or even intact as a group.
The interests of  an elite also include dominance itself, the ability to
make its interests prevail.  Dominance in  this sense is  consistent with the
definition of  power offered by Max Weber as  the “chances of  a  man  or  a
number of men to realize their own will in a social action even against the
resistance of others who are participating in the action.”
## [72]
The managerial
elites of the 20th century exhibit the unity and dominance that are
characteristic of  other elites. The subjective unity  of  the managerial elite
derives principally from the myths, worldview,  and ideology by which it
rationalizes its dominance and which reflect its interests. These interests
themselves are the source of the objective unity of the managerial elite. The
elite consists of  persons who possess the scientific, administrative, and
technical skills necessary for the  control and operation of  structurally and
functionally complex, technologically intensive mass organizations. These

skills yield power and other social rewards such as high income and status
only through their application within such organizations. The principal
objective interests of the managerial elite therefore consist in the
enlargement of  such organizations, the intensification of  their complexity,
the preservation of their scale and functional complexity, and the extension
of mass organizations as the dominant structures in the political, economic,
and cultural orders. These interests are common to the managerial elites of
the three sectors of  mass society—state, economy,  and organizations of
culture and communication—and serve to unite them against non-
managerial forces, such as the remnants of bourgeois and prescriptive elites,
regardless of  what conflicts and rivalries may exist among the managers.
The effort to enlarge political, economic, and cultural organizations
involves a  struggle against the constraints on enlargement, and, because
these constraints  include the institutional and ideological fabric of the
bourgeois order and the power base of the bourgeois elite, the emergence of
the managerial elite and its pursuit of  its interests necessarily involve a
conflict with the bourgeois elite and the kind of society it rules.
The conflict with the bourgeois elite and the interests of the new elite in
enlarging the mass organizations under its control and expanding the scope
and rewards of its skills generate further interests of the managerial elite in
reconstructing and fusing the state, economy,  and culture within the
disciplines of mass organizations. In the state, the conflict with the
bourgeois elite involves the alliance of the emergent managerial elite with
the underclass of the bourgeois order and the adoption of a Caesarist tactic
and political style during the period of emergence. Centralization and
bureaucratization of functions and powers, displacing local political
institutions, yield enhanced power for technically skilled administrators by
increasing the opportunities for applying their skills not only to the

apparatus of the government itself but also to social and economic
relationships by social engineering,  the teleocratic  design of social and
economic arrangements, and the managerial control of processes of
socialization.
In the economy, the imperative of managerial enlargement involves the
re-organization of  labor in  collective disciplines, the dematerialization of
property,  reliance  on mass consumption and the regulation of  aggregate
demand, an oligopolistic organization of production, and the homogeneous
routinization of  patterns of  mass consumption. In  the culture, the interests
of the managerial elites in the mass organizations of culture and
communication require similar homogenization as well as the enhancement
of the role of the managerial intelligentsia in transmitting and disseminating
the skills  and ideology of  the new elite, challenging the dominance of
bourgeois institutional and ideological patterns, and designing,  debating,
and implementing the reconstruction of  social institutions. The objective
interests of  the managerial elite  thus imply the elaboration of  a  new and
distinctive form of political, economic, and cultural organization and serve
to unify the elites of the mass organizations around these interests.
These objective interests of the managerial elite are identified and
communicated by  means of  the managerial ideology,  which facilitates the
formation of  the subjective unity of  the elite by defining its interests in
codes that communicate them to the elite but manipulate the perceptions of
these interests by social groups outside the elite. The ideology justifies the
expansion of mass organizations in state, economy, and culture and the role
of those who possess managerial skills in controlling and directing them as
the principal leadership group in  mass society.  Like most elite ideologies,
the managerial ideology does not explicitly appeal to  the interests of  the

managers but rather to  moral values, religious and philosophical beliefs,
social, economic, and political theories, and other general principles that, in
effect if not by design, justify the increasing power of the managers and the
organizations under their control and instill in  the subordinate society the
belief that managerial leadership is legitimate.
The unity of  the  managerial elite does not preclude conflict within it,
competition between its members and organizations, political and
ideological rivalries, or divergences of petty interests. The interests around
which the elite is unified are structural interests, arising from and pertaining
to the organization of its power, and not the personal or particular interests
of specific members or organizational units of the elite. Different
components of the elite may emphasize the priority of some interests over
others or express different strategies and preferences in  organizing and
pursuing their interests, and such internal differentiation may generate
conflict or the appearance of more disunity than actually exists. The
expression of conflicts over how the interests of the elite should be pursued
does not violate or contradict the unity that the elite exhibits.
The dominance of  the managerial elite, its  ability to  make its  interests
prevail over those  of  bourgeois and other non-managerial groups, derives
directly from the control that its technical and managerial skills yield over
the mass organizations and, in  particular,  from the power that these
organizations themselves exert over subordinate social groups and non-
managerial forms of organization. Mass organizations exhibit several
advantages over  smaller and more compact forms of  organization for the
establishment of dominance. In the economy, the mass corporate and labor
organizations control more financial resources and personnel and in a more
concentrated form than do the smaller entrepreneurial units of the bourgeois

order.  The mass organizations of  the economy are closely integrated with
the managerial state, which possesses a monopoly of overwhelming force,
and with  the mass organizations of culture and communication, which
through their manipulative techniques command and discipline a  mass
audience and through their educational functions provide the  reserve of
skills by which the elite acquires and exercises organizational control.
The analogous bourgeois organizations in the state, economy,  and
culture are at  a  disadvantage in  the conflict with the managerial elite
because they do not have access to the resources of force, wealth, and mass
persuasion and manipulation that  the managers control. The localism and
dispersion of the bourgeois order render its available resources difficult or
impossible to  coordinate for a  unified defense of  bourgeois interests and
render it  vulnerable to  disunity and distraction, whereas the concentration
and centralization associated with managerial forces facilitate their
coordination and reduce disunity and diversions within the managerial elite.
The bourgeois elite and its adherents, moreover, have generally lacked the
sophisticated managerial and technical skills that characterize the
managerial elite and thus have been unable to  emulate the managerial
apparatus of power or to challenge and compete with emergent managerial
elements within the mass organizations.
The managerial skills of  the elite  are the fundamental social force that
enables groups possessing these skills to  establish their dominance. C.
Wright Mills and Hans H. Gerth criticized James Burnham’s formulation of
the theory of the managerial revolution in  part because of Burnham’s
“assumption that  the technical indispensability of  certain functions in  a
social structure are taken ipso facto  as  a  prospective claim for political
power.”
## [73]
The  power that  technical and managerial skills yield, however,

does not  derive simply from the indispensability of the functions they
perform but also from the fact that the performance of at least some of these
functions constitutes power or the elicitation of obedience. In the
managerial corporation, managerial skills perform functions concerning
personnel, financing, research, production, and marketing, and the decisions
that direct their performance constitute power within the corporation.
Similarly,  in the managerial state, managerial skills perform  not only
administrative functions within the apparatus of government but also
regulatory functions that affect social and economic relationships external
to  the apparatus.  In  the mass organizations of  culture and communication,
managerial skills also determine the internal functioning of the
organizations as well as the content and dissemination of the messages they
communicate to their mass audiences. Managerial skills yield power within
mass organizations, therefore, not  only because they are indispensable to
the functioning of  these organizations but also because the functions that
the skills perform are themselves acts of power.
Managerial control of the mass organizations of the state, economy, and
culture yields dominance within society through control of the major
instruments of force, the means of production and exchange, and the
organizations of culture and communication. While all three  modes of
power are  important to  managerial dominance, in  the “hard” managerial
regimes of the national socialist and communist systems, the instruments of
force are the principal support of the elite. In the “soft” regimes of the West,
however,  the social force of managerial skill operates mainly through
manipulation. The mass organizations of culture and communication, which
manipulate the perceptions of the subordinate social groups, therefore
acquire increasing importance as  a  support of  the elite. The managerial
state, however,  also regularly relies on manipulation more than coercion

and intimidation, and its bureaucratic elite enhances its power through the
application of  its technical and managerial skills to  the manipulation of
social relationships and institutions through social engineering. The
managerial state also is fused with and relies on the mass organizations of
culture and communication for the legitimization of its social engineering.
The mass organizations of the economy similarly rely on the manipulation
of patterns of mass consumption and on the mass media for the regulation
of consumption through advertising and other forms of manipulation.
The characterization of the managerial elite as unified and dominant is
not generally accepted by social scientists. The critics of the theory of the
managerial revolution consist, broadly, of two schools. On the one hand, the
exponents of what may be called the “power elite school” grant that an elite
holds social, political, and economic power in  the United States but deny
that managers are the dominant element in the elite. On the other hand, the
exponents of what is known as the “pluralist school” criticize the theory of
the managerial revolution (or at least its applications outside the corporate
sector) on the grounds that corporate managers and government bureaucrats
do not share or  pursue common interests (i.e., that the managers are not
unified). In  some respects, both schools of  criticism have offered some
sound points against the theory of the managerial revolution as it  was
originally formulated by James Burnham, yet both schools also have
misunderstood some of the key terms and concepts of the theory and have
failed to appreciate its validity if certain erroneous but non-essential parts of
the theory are reformulated. The most important term that has been
misunderstood is  the term “manager,”  and a  clarification of  its meaning
should lay to rest some of the more important criticisms of the theory and
demonstrate its relevance to  contemporary social and political as  well as
economic power arrangements.

The Definition of the Manager
The  terms “manager” and  “management” are  ambiguous  in
contemporary American usage. When American businessmen and
economists talk of “management,” they usually mean “top management,”
and it is in this sense that Berle and Means used the term:
“Management” may be defined as that body of men who, in law, have formally assumed
the duties of exercising domination over the corporate business and assets. It thus derives
its position from a legal title of some sort. Universally, under the American system of law,
managers consist of a board of directors and the senior officers of the corporation.
## [74]
The meaning of the term “management” in this sense is legalistic and
narrow. James Burnham, in The Managerial Revolution, did not use the
term in exactly this sense, however. He distinguished between what Berle
and Means called “managers” and what Burnham called “executives,” on
the one hand, and “managers” in a broader and functional sense. Taking the
hypothetical example of an automobile company, Burnham held that
Certain individuals—the operating executives, production managers, plant
superintendents, and  their  associates—have  charge  of  the  actual technical process of
producing. It  is  their  job  to  organize the  materials, tools,  machines, plant  facilities,
equipment,and labor  in  such  a  way  as  to  turn  out  the  automobiles. These are  the
individuals whom I call “the managers.”
## [75]
The executives, however, “have the functions of guiding the company
toward a profit” and “there is clearly no necessary connection between them
and the first type of function.”
## [76]
For Burnham, then, management consisted
in  the  direction of  the  technical  processes of  production. Technicality,
indeed, was the hallmark of the managerial function, and the increase in the
technicality of  production was  the  sociological basis  of  the  managerial
revolution in the economic organizations of the 20th century.

There is a combined shift:    through changes in the technique of production, the functions of
management become more distinctive, more complex, more specialized, and more crucial
to  the  whole process of  production, thus  serving to  set  off  those  who  perform these
functions as a separate group or class in society; and at the same time those who formerly
carried out  what  functions there  were  of  management, the bourgeoisie,  themselves
withdraw from management, so that the difference in function becomes also a difference in
the individuals who carry out the function.
## [77]
Burnham mistakenly believed that the corporation would eventually be
nationalized, that the managers who controlled production would have little
use  for  the  executive functions and  would ally  with  the  managerial
bureaucrats of the state to eliminate entirely the executive functions and the
other vestiges of bourgeois capitalism. Although he was correct in seeing
that the economy would become fused with the state, he did not then see
that  this  fusion would not  be  a  literal  and  formal one,  as  under  actual
socialism, but informal though nonetheless real. What Burnham perhaps
failed to appreciate sufficiently was that the executive functions themselves
were becoming increasingly technical and complex and that they too would
remain necessary for the corporation in an economy of mass production and
mass consumption.
Burnham’s essential point, however, was that the technically necessary
functions of  a  modern corporation—whether managerial or  executive—
would provide control of  the  corporation to  whatever groups and
individuals could perform them. It is the performance of the technically
necessary functions of a corporation, then, not legal authority, that yields
control and  constitutes management. It  is  in  this  sense  also  that  John
Kenneth Galbraith uses  his  own  term  “technostructure.” The  term
“management” in the narrow sense includes “only a small proportion of
those who, as participants, contribute information to group decision.”
This latter group is very large. . . . It embraces all who bring specialized knowledge, talent,
or experience to group decision-making. This, not the narrow management group, is the
guiding intelligence—the brain—of the enterprise. There is no name for all who participate

in  group  decision-making or  the  organization  which they  form.  I  propose to  call  this
organization the technostructure.
## [78]
In a footnote on the same page, Galbraith notes the parallel conclusions
of Daniel Bell “that modern economic society requires extensive planning
for which knowledge is the decisive resource,” and in a later footnote he
also acknowledges the contribution of James Burnham to the concept of the
corporation.
## [79]
Alfred D.   Chandler, Jr. and Peter Drucker, who are among
the most knowledgeable scholars of modern corporate management, while
concentrating on the executive and business functions of managers, also call
attention to its highly technical nature. As Chandler writes, “the careers of
the salaried managers who directed these hierarchies became increasingly
technical and professional.”
In  these  new  business bureaucracies, as  in  other  administrative hierarchies requiring
specialized skills, selection and  promotion  became increasingly based on  training,
experience, and performance rather than on family relationship or money. . . . In such
enterprises, managerial training became increasingly longer and more formalized.
## [80]
Drucker, while emphasizing the “limits of technocracy” in successful
management, also calls attention to the importance of technical skills in the
modern management movement:
The management boom focused on management skills and management competence. But
it largely defined the management job as internal. It was concerned with organization and
motivation, with financial and other controls, with the management sciences, and with
manager development. It was, to use a formidable term, technocratic. It was also right.
## [81]
Technicality,    technocratic, complexity,    professionalization,
specialization, skill,  training, knowledge—these terms  characterize the
description of  the  central and  controlling groups of  modern corporate
enterprise in the writings of the most prominent scholars and theorists of the
modern corporation. Although Burnham, Galbraith, Bell,  Chandler,  and
Drucker are a diverse group, although their ideas and predictions often are
mutually contradictory,  their  views of  how  the  modern corporation is

controlled and  who  controls it  are  essentially identical. All  of  them
emphasize the importance of technical functions, whether in production or
in  business executive operations, rather than  legal  authority,  personal
wealth, individual talent, or family relationships, in establishing control of
the modern corporation, and although the terms they use to apply to these
functions vary, the term “manager” is a useful one.
Management, therefore, may  be  defined in  reference to  the  modern
corporation as the body of technical skills necessary for the operation and
direction of  the  mass  corporation  (what Galbraith calls  the  “mature
corporation”), which is itself characterized by the dramatically large size
and scale of its assets, plant, labor force, research, production, distribution,
and marketing functions, and the large size and scale of which functions
typically involve a  high  degree of  complexity,  technicality,  and
specialization. Management, in a broad sense, thus includes not only the
managers in the narrow sense of those who perform executive functions but
also  the  technicians—scientists,  researchers, engineers, economists,
lawyers, and  social scientists—who perform the  specialized functions
necessary to mass production and distribution.
The nature of executive functions in the mass corporation justifies the
inclusion of  the  executives in  the  same  category as  the  technicians of
production. Executive functions increasingly involve a  high  degree of
specialized skills  in  the  intricacies of  economics, accounting, statistics,
psychology,  operations research, and  the  application of  cybernetics to
human social and organizational activities, and it is for this reason that
schools of business administration and management have been established
by  universities and  by  corporations themselves. Corporate executive
functions, which largely  have  to  do  with  non-productive aspects of  the

corporation, are  thus  at  least  as  technical and  require at  least  as  much
specialized, professional skill as the productive functions and are no less
necessary for  the  operation and  direction of  the  corporate organization.
Indeed, the corporate executive functions are analogous to the technical
functions of production. Just as the latter operate on the inert resources that
constitute the  materials of  production, so  the  executives operate on  the
human resources that constitute the materials of modern business activity—
social, psychological, and  economic behavior,  whether within the
corporation as labor or personnel or outside it as consumers or competitors.
“The manager,” writes Peter Drucker, using the term now in the narrow
sense  of  “executive,” “works with  a  specific resource: man.”
## [82]
It  is
precisely this view of human beings as analogous to the inert matter of
nature—iron and  steel, chemicals, or  electrons—that underlies the
“scientism” that William H.  Whyte, Jr. saw as one of the basic premises of
the “organization man,” “the premise that with the same techniques that
have worked in the physical sciences we can eventually create an exact
science of man.”
## [83]
The premise of scientism underlies and informs the very
nature of  management, and  its  tacit  or  explicit acceptance characterizes
managers (whether executive or technical) in corporations, in the state, and
in the mass organizations of culture and communication. Scientism is an
important premise of managerial ideology and serves as an important bond,
whether as an overt element of a formal ideology or simply as a habit of
thought that contributes to the unity between the managerial elites in the
different sectors of the managerial regime.
The technicality and scientism of the managerial elite suggest that a
more appropriate term than “manager” for the members of this group might
be “technocrat.” Indeed, those writers who have discussed the managerial
revolution and the managerial elite have often used the term “technocrat”

almost as a synonym for “manager.” In the 1930s, when Burnham was
beginning to  formulate his  theory,  the  term  “Technocracy”  (usually
capitalized) referred to a particular political and economic movement. The
word  itself  was  coined in  1919  by  William Henry Smyth  and  was
popularized in the 1930s by Howard Scott, who was associated for a time
with  Thorstein Veblen.
## [84]
## In The Managerial Revolution,  Burnham
identified Technocracy as “another example of an American variant of the
managerial ideologies,” which failed to gain a wide following because its
theory was “not dressed up enough for major ideological purposes,” though
“the  society  about  which the  Technocrats write  is  quite  obviously
managerial society,”  and  “the  developed native-American managerial
ideologies of  the  future will  doubtless incorporate Technocratic
propaganda.”
## [85]
More recently,  Daniel Bell  has  written of  “The
Technocratic Mind-View” that
In  its  emphasis on  the  logical, practical,  problem-solving, instrumental, orderly,  and
disciplined approach  to  objectives, in  its  reliance on  a  calculus, on  precision  and
measurement and a concept of a system, it is a worldview quite opposed to the traditional
and customary religious, esthetic, and intuitive modes.
## [86]
The term “technocracy,” then, whether as a particular movement of the
Depression era  or  as  a  more  general term  involving power through or
government by technically skilled persons, has affinities with management
and the ideology and mentality associated with it. Yet “technocracy” is not
an entirely satisfactory substitute for “management.” It is today a word that
is  generally associated with  the  technical skills  of  physical science and
engineering rather than  the  social and  organizational sciences, which
management also  includes. Furthermore, the  historical key  to  the
managerial revolution lies in the revolution of mass and scale and the need
for technical skills in operating the mass organizations that resulted from
this revolution. The power that technical skills acquire therefore depends on

and results from the nature of mass organizations. By themselves, technical
skills and functions do not lead to power—a point similar to the criticism of
Burnham by  Mills  and  Gerth—and acquire power only  when  they  are
applied to  the  operation and  direction of  mass  organizations in  state,
economy, and culture. In so far, then, as the word “technocracy” suggests
only power through technical skill and not power through technical skills in
controlling and operating mass organizations, it does not mean the same
thing as the term “management” in Burnham’s usage. Nevertheless, those
writers who discuss technocracy very often, on closer inspection, turn out to
be discussing one aspect or another of managerial society and the elite that
rules it, and such discussions of technocracy often provide clues to the
nature of the managerial regime.
The definition of manager in terms of function rather than in legal terms
has two important implications. First, it renders irrelevant the seemingly
endless dispute among economists over whether most major corporations
are  “manager controlled” or  “family controlled.” This  dispute  has  been
conducted almost exclusively with reference to Berle and Means’s work
and in terms of their legalistic and formal definition of management. For the
purposes of  this  dispute, “control” means simply legal  control of  stock
shares, and the debate is over whether a family or its agents “control” in this
sense sufficient stock to dictate policy to the top management or whether
the  top  managers “control” the  corporation through legal  devices and
dispersion of ownership. To define managers in terms of function, however,
is to understand “control” in a different sense, the sense of actual ability to
conduct corporate business, which depends on mastery of technical and
managerial skills. Even if a family or individual owns a majority of the
stock of a corporation, such ownership by itself does not lead to control in a
functional sense, because ownership does not yield technical knowledge

and skill. Owners of large amounts of stock must either acquire technical
skill themselves or rely on professionals (managers) who possess it. Thus, a
managerial corporation, in  the  sense  that  Burnham defined  the  term
“manager,” is one that is operated and directed by persons who possess
managerial skills and not necessarily a corporation in which managers own
or legally control significant blocs of stock. A corporation in which a large
percentage of the stock is owned by a family or individual may still be a
managerial corporation if the scale and technicality of its activities require
managerial functions. The  best  indicator of  whether a  corporation is
managerial or entrepreneurial (under the functional control of an individual
or family that also owns it) is not who owns or controls the stock but the
size and scale of the corporation and the kind of activities in which it is
engaged. There is, of course, an overlap between mass corporations that are
sufficiently large and complex in their operations to require the functional
control of managers, on the one hand, and, on the other, corporations in
which the ownership of stock is dispersed (the latter tend to be the larger
corporations), but there seem to be notable exceptions to this rule. There is,
then,  no  necessary connection  between the  meaning of  manager in
Burnham’s sense and the meaning in the sense of Berle and Means, but for
the  purposes of  discussing Burnham’s  version of  the  theory of  the
managerial revolution and its reformulation, it is important to distinguish
between the  two  meanings and  to  use  the  terms “manager” and
“management” consistently in Burnham’s sense.
The second implication of Burnham’s definition of manager is that the
term can be extended to include the technically skilled personnel of any
mass organization and is not restricted (as Berle and Means’s term must be)
to corporate leaders. The basic premise of the theory of the managerial
revolution is that the expansion of the mass and scale of an organization

creates a need for technical skills in operating it. Thus, both the mass state
and other large-scale organizations as well as the mass corporation require
basically the same kind of skills that the corporation requires.
It is a distinctive feature of Burnham’s formulation of the theory of the
managerial revolution that the emergence of the managers as an elite occurs
not only in the corporation but also in the state and that the term “manager”
refers not only to corporate technicians and executives but also to the public
bureaucracies of  government. “The  active  heads  of  the  bureaus are  the
managers-in-government, the  same, or  nearly the  same, in  training,
functions, skills,  habits  of  thought as  the  managers-in-industry.”
## [87]
## This
insight by  Burnham resembles the  earlier idea  of  Max  Weber  that  the
elements of bureaucracy “in public and lawful government . . . constitute
‘bureaucratic authority.’  In  private  economic domination, they  constitute
bureaucratic ‘management.’”
## [88]
Both Weber and Burnham, that is, saw the
modern state and the modern corporation as being governed by the same
forces of power and authority, though Weber used the term “bureaucracy”
and  Burnham the  term  “manager.”  The  distinctive contribution of
Burnham’s  theory  of  the  managerial revolution is  his  extension of  the
concept of manager from the narrow corporate sphere to include the broader
sphere of mass government and other mass organizations. In recent usage
the phrase “managerial revolution” has survived only in reference to the
corporation and its internal control, and Galbraith, Chandler, Daniel Bell,
and others use it in this sense. Burnham’s application of the phrase and
concept of the managerial revolution to a parallel development in the state
(as  well  as  to  mass  labor  unions and,  by  implication, other  mass
organizations) means that the theory of the managerial revolution is in fact a
theory of  political and  social, as  well  as  economic, revolution, a
civilizational revolution. The validity and significance of the theory of the

managerial revolution therefore largely  depend on  the  validity  of  the
extension of the term “manager” to government bureaucrats as well as to
corporate officials,  and  the  debate over  this  conceptual extension is  an
important aspect of the debate over the applicability of the concept of a
unified managerial elite in the United States.

The Critique of the Theory of the
## Managerial Revolution
The Power Elite Argument: Are the Managers
## Dominant?
The  principal exponents of  the  “power elite  school” are  the  late
C.  Wright Mills and his disciple, G.  William Domhoff. This school denies
that managerial groups in either the corporation or the state are independent
of or antagonistic to the “big stockholders” or propertied elite, and it claims
that  private property and  wealth,  at  least  in  large  concentrations,  yield
political, economic, and social power. Mills held that “The recent social
history of American capitalism does not reveal any distinct break in the
continuity of the higher capitalist class. . . . The main drift of the upper
classes . . . points unambiguously to the continuation of a world that is quite
congenial to  the  continuation of  the  corporate rich.”
## [89]
## Although Mills
perceived and acknowledged that managerial functions in large corporations
were necessary for the economic interests of the modern “propertied class,”
he argued that the managers were drawn from or became assimilated into
the  propertied class  (or  upper  class  or  propertied elite—terms largely
interchangeable in Mills’s theory) and were thus subordinate to it.
The propertied class, in the age of corporate property, has become a corporate rich, and in
becoming corporate has consolidated its power and drawn to its defense new men of more
executive and more political stance. . . . They are a corporate rich because they depend
directly,  as  well  as  indirectly,  for  their  money,  their  privileges, their  securities, their
advantages, their powers on the world of the big corporations.
## [90]
G.   William Domhoff concurs, quoting this passage and affirming his
belief that “it seems even more correct in the light of the information on

ownership and on executive behavior that has been developed since that
time” when Mills was writing.
## [91]
Comparatively few students of American corporate structure agree with
the power elite theory of Mills and Domhoff, and there is a continuing
dispute among economists over the question whether “big owners” (i.e., a
“propertied elite”) or  professional managers actually control the  larger
corporations. Alfred D.  Chandler, Jr., for example, argues the opposite view
that although “wealthy families . . . are the beneficiaries of managerial
capitalism,” there is “little evidence that these families make basic decisions
concerning the  operations of  modern capitalistic enterprises and  of  the
economy in which they operate,” and Chandler found that “members of the
entrepreneurial family rarely became active in top management unless they
themselves were trained as professional managers.”
## [92]
Regardless of these different schools, it is largely irrelevant whether the
propertied elite acquires managerial skills, takes an active part in managing
corporate enterprise, or has assimilated non-propertied elite managers into
its own class and interests. What Mills and Domhoff and their school do not
sufficiently perceive or appreciate thoroughly is that the interests of the
propertied elite have changed substantially with the revolution of mass and
scale in the economy. The propertied elite or “grande bourgeoisie” of the
bourgeois order may not have changed significantly in family composition,
and certainly it retains wealth and status. Its economic interests, however,
have changed from being vested in the hard property of privately owned
and operated entrepreneurial firms, usually comparatively small in scale, to
being intertwined with and dependent upon the dematerialized property of
publicly owned, state-integrated, managerially operated mass corporations.
Even if members of the propertied elite retain “controlling ownership” of

large blocs of stock, even if they acquire managerial skills and take an
active part  in  corporate business, and  even  if  they  assimilate non-elite
managers into their own class, the mass corporations on which they depend
for  their  wealth possess interests radically different  from  those  of  the
entrepreneurial firm.  Such  corporations must  undertake a  mass  level  of
production and encourage a mass level of consumption, and therefore they
must be integrated with the mass state and the mass organizations of culture
and communication to regulate aggregate demand, to maintain the level of
the  technical skills necessary for  their  operation, and  to  manage
consumption through mass  advertising. The  corporations therefore also
must encourage the dissemination of an ethic and ideology of hedonism in
economic behavior that legitimizes and promotes the compulsion to seek
immediate gratification, as  well  as  the  other  components of  managerial
ideology. And, in order to realize these interests, the mass corporations—
regardless of who owns or legally controls them—must seek to expand their
own size and scope and to undermine, discredit, or subsume the institutions,
values, and structures of the bourgeois order that constrain the pursuit of
managerial interests.  In  other  words, the  propertied elite,  because of  its
dependence on managerial capitalism, must cooperate with the corporate
managerial elite in the working out of the imperatives and ideologies of the
managerial regime and the weakening of the bourgeois order, from which
the propertied elite originated.
The economic dependence of the modern propertied elite on managerial
capitalism and on the managerial elite that enables the mass corporation to
function establishes  a  strong argument for  the  subordination of  the
propertied elite to the managers. The propertied elite would be unable to
retain its wealth without the managers of the corporation, who possess the
skills to perform corporate managerial functions, and without the apparatus

of managerial capitalism. Yet, even when members of the propertied elite
do  acquire  managerial skills  and  take  an  active, professional part  in
corporate business, they  tend  to  merge  with  the  managerial elite.  The
process by which such skills are acquired—either by formal education or by
practical experience—serves to  inculcate managerial perspectives and
ideologies into those who acquire them, and, more importantly, it serves to
alert them to the new economic interests that managerial capitalism has
created. The  process of  assimilation, emphasized by  both  Mills  and
Domhoff,  in  other  words, works  both  ways.  “New  men”  who  become
managers and are not drawn from the propertied elite may acquire its social
values, but both they and the members of the propertied elite who acquire
managerial skills  also  learn  to  identify and  pursue the  new  economic
interests of those who depend on managerial capitalism, and thereby they
acquire managerial interests and values.
The dependence of the mass corporations of managerial capitalism on
managerial functions for their operation and direction means that those who
are able to perform these functions—whether drawn from the propertied
elite or not—control the corporation. Those members of the propertied elite
who are not managers and cannot perform this function nevertheless depend
on and profit from it and are unable to retain their wealth without it. The
failure of social scientists such as Mills and Domhoff
## [93]
to recognize and
appreciate the  significance of  this  substantive change in  the  economic
interests of the propertied elite renders moot most of their argument about
the  continuity of  the  composition of  the  propertied elite.  Despite this
continuity, the rise of managerial capitalism changes the interests of the
propertied elite and its relationship to the dominant economic forces. It is
not the ownership or legal control of property that constitutes the means by
which these forces are controlled, as in the entrepreneurial capitalism of the

bourgeois order, but the ability to perform the functions of management, to
operate and direct the mass corporation, and it is those who are able to
perform this function who are in a position to become dominant in the
economy and the other sectors where managerial functions are necessary.
The  significance  of  this  change in  the  economic interests and
relationships of the propertied elite under managerial capitalism is that the
economic interests of the propertied elite are no longer consistent with the
bourgeois order. The propertied elite, the grande bourgeoisie, thus does not
retain an economic interest in acting as the leader of the bourgeois order
and defending its ideologies, values, and institutions; its material interests
push it toward defending the complex of managerial interests. Even though
the propertied elite may retain its attachment to essentially grand bourgeois
values and styles and may even seek to defend bourgeois ideologies, it
cannot exert  power in  the  managerial corporation in  defense of  the
bourgeois order without jeopardizing the functions of the corporation and
undermining its  own  affluence, which derives from  the  anti-bourgeois
dynamic of managerial capitalism. The result is that the bourgeois order is
effectively decapitated and ceases to generate a powerful resistance to the
managerial regime. The grande bourgeoisie, the logical leadership group of
the bourgeois order, ceases to be bourgeois and becomes an appendage of
the managerial elite. Increasingly it finds itself imprisoned in a gilded cage,
wealthy, leisured, well-educated, enjoying high social status, often celebrity
and sometimes high political office, but unable to control the major social
forces of the age without becoming part of them, forced to abandon its
bourgeois heritage, and unable also to hold power over the regime that the
new forces have created.
## [94]
In  addition  to  failing to  recognize that  the  interests, if  not  the

composition, of  the  propertied elite  have  changed substantially in  the
transition to managerial capitalism, Domhoff does not present especially
compelling evidence for his argument that the propertied elite continues to
take part in corporate management. First, most of the evidence he presents
is drawn from studies of corporate management in the “narrow” formal or
legalistic sense  of  Berle  and  Means and  not  in  the  functional sense  of
Burnham and Galbraith. Such studies have tended to concentrate on “top
management” and boards of corporate directors, partly because sources for
this level are relatively accessible. They have little to say about corporate
personnel at  lower  levels  or  about  technically essential personnel (e.g.,
scientists, economists, or  lawyers) who  are  not  involved in  formal
management but are managers in the functional sense and may exercise
considerable power in specific managerial decisions. Secondly, studies of
top management do not show an inordinate or clearly predominant role of
members of the propertied elite or upper class. The studies do show that
most corporate managers and directors come from white, Protestant, middle
class, business families; in this they resemble the propertied elite but lack
its essential characteristic, privately owned wealth. Some data presented by
Domhoff  also  show  that  members of  the  “upper class” (in  his  sense)
become businessmen  or  financiers and  often  become leaders of  their
companies, but often these companies appear to be privately owned and
smaller rather than the large corporations that dominate the economy and in
which managerial functions are necessary.
## [95]
Domhoff cites several studies
to show that about “30 per cent of the corporate elite are upper class in
origin.”
## [96]
The converse of this finding, of course, is that about 70 per cent
of the corporate elite—a substantial majority—are not upper class in origin,
and in fact about 59 percent are middle class and the rest of lower class or
undetermined social origin. Domhoff’s  indicators for  inclusion in  the

“upper class” are in fact social—attendance at certain prestigious schools
and universities, membership in certain prestigious clubs, and listing in the
Social Register—rather than economic. He does not show, in other words,
that  members of  the  “upper class” are  necessarily members of  the
“propertied elite,” and hence it does not follow that upper class members of
the corporate elite are members of the propertied elite.
{Moreover, the contention of Mills and Domhoff that the composition of
the  “corporate elite”  reflects continuity with  the  older  “upper class”  or
“propertied elite” is open to challenge, and in the 1970s may have ceased to
be true. Robert C. Christopher, surveying the changes in the corporate elite
in recent years, notes that “control of the levers of economic power in the
United States, long primarily confined to WASPs, has now ceased to be the
prerogative of any particular ethnic group.”
## [97]
Of the families included in the first national listing of rich Americans that B.C. Forbes, the
founder of Forbes magazine, published in 1918, fewer than ten were still to be found on
the list that the magazine published sixty-six years later. And of the thousand rich New
York families identified by Moses Yale Beach in 1845, not a single one showed up in the
Forbes 1985 rankings.
## [98][99]
## }
Christopher offers a brief list of corporate chief executives and senior
operating officers of leading American corporations in 1986 that contains
Jewish, Hispanic, Polish, Armenian, Greek, and Italian surnames and which
“offers clear evidence of a major change in American society: within the
space of  a  single  generation, members of  those  ethnic groups that
comprised the great waves of immigration that rolled into this country in
the  century before World  War  II  have  become an  integral part  of  the
nation’s corporate establishment.”
## [100]
Nor is Domhoff’s argument that “rising executives are assimilated into
the upper class and come to share its values”
## [101]
very compelling. Domhoff

discusses two kinds of “assimilation,” social (through education at “upper
class” schools and universities, acceptance into “upper class” clubs, and
socialization between upper  and  non-upper class  executives and  their
families) and  economic (principally through stock  options, by  which
corporate managers acquire sizable incomes and hence become members of
the propertied elite). The argument for social assimilation is not persuasive
because Domhoff does not show that institutional social contacts (at schools
and clubs, for example) with upper class persons have any significant effect
on the psychology, thinking, behavior, or perception of interests of non-
upper class persons, nor does he consider the possibility (as noted above)
that such contacts and class mingling may exert influences on the upper
class  from  their  non-upper class  associates at  such  institutions. The
argument for economic assimilation also is not persuasive. It is true that
corporate executives often acquire considerable wealth by stock options,
although as Domhoff acknowledges, “They do not usually accumulate a
significant percentage of stock in the giant corporations they manage.”
## [102]
Such wealth, however, is directly derived from the corporations under their
control and not from any kind of largesse from or economic dependency on
the  propertied elite.  The  acquisition of  corporate wealth by  managers
therefore does  not  alter  their  economic interests in  the  managerial
corporation, make them in any way dependent on the propertied elite, or
(most important) weaken their control of the corporation. Nor does personal
wealth derived from the stock of the managerial corporation constitute a
source of decisive social power. Personal wealth certainly yields comfort
and luxury, status, and access to circles and institutions in which members
of  the  elite  congregate, but  it  does  not  directly yield  the  technical and
managerial skills  by  which mass  organizations are  controlled. Personal
wealth is,  in  Wittfogel’s  terms,  “revenue property” and  not  “power

property.”
Critics of the theory of the managerial revolution such as C.  Wright
Mills and G. William Domhoff have challenged the claims of those social
scientists who  deny  the  existence of  an  elite  or  governing class  in
contemporary mass society, but their argument that the propertied elite has
retained continuous control of the mass economy is wrong if it means more
than that the composition of the propertied elite has been continuous and
that its members continue to possess large wealth in the form of private
property and if they fail to recognize that the economic interests and social
functions of the propertied elite have altered dramatically under the impact
of  managerial  capitalism. There is  no  compelling evidence  that  large
numbers of the upper class or propertied elite continue to play a dominant
role in the management of large corporations, though some members of the
upper  class  do  continue to  take  part  in  at  least  the  formal, executive
functions of top management and some have actually made the transition to
being professional managers. Nor is there compelling evidence that non-
upper class  managers are  assimilated into  the  upper class  by  social
association and acquisition of wealth. In any case, both the propertied elite
as  well  as  the  managerial elite  are  dependent on  and  beneficiaries of
managerial capitalism and its institutions and processes. Their economic
interests therefore lie in the promotion of managerial capitalism and in the
integration of the managerial regime in state, economy, and culture rather
than in the defense of the now moribund bourgeois regime. Indeed, the
managerial economic interests  of  the  propertied elite  encourage  it  to
weaken the  institutions, values,  and  power of  the bourgeois  order.  The
dependence of the propertied elite on the managers therefore enables the
latter  to  make their  interests prevail over  whatever bourgeois or
entrepreneurial interests the  propertied elite  may  retain. The  managerial

elite,  however,  is  generally not  in  conflict with  or  subordinate  to  the
“corporate rich” sectors of the propertied elite but constitutes rather the
functional vanguard of a metamorphosed propertied elite that has become
dependent on the managers and has ceased to be a significant part of the
bourgeois order. The relationship between the two elites—one dependent on
its command of functions, the other on its ownership of wealth derived from
such functions in the economy—therefore does not contradict the thesis that
the managerial elements constitute a largely dominant elite in mass society.
The Pluralist Argument: Are the Managers
## Unified?
The  second  main  argument against the  existence of  a  dominant and
unified managerial elite in the United States is that of the “pluralist” school,
which was widespread among American social and political scientists in the
1950s and 1960s. Developed mainly in opposition to the power elite theory
of C. Wright Mills and his followers, the pluralist thesis holds that, despite
the existence of relatively small but powerful groups that may be called
“elites,” these groups do  not  share sufficient common interests,
membership, or beliefs to create the unity that is a necessary characteristic
of a single, unified elite. The pluralists argue that in modern industrialized,
democratic societies, the complexity of economic, political, and cultural life
and the high degree of specialization necessary for leadership prevent the
formation of a unified or homogeneous elite. The pluralist thesis that no
such homogeneous elite exists in the United States has been articulated in
various forms by  political scientists Robert Dahl  and  David Truman;
economist John Kenneth Galbraith in his theory of “countervailing power”;
sociologists David Riesman in his concept of “veto groups” and Arnold M.
Rose  in  his  “multi-influence hypothesis”; and  the  exponents of  the

functionalist school of sociology such as Talcott Parsons and his disciple
Suzanne Keller  in  her  theory of  “strategic elites.”
## [103]
## As  Geraint Parry
summarizes the pluralist thesis,
As specialism increases [in modern societies] it becomes more difficult for individuals to
undertake new activities without undergoing new training, and it is rarer for one man to
play a number of roles at any one time. . . . These pluralistic analyses of the power
structure offer a picture of diversity but not of equality. They deny that modern societies
are  under  the  control of  a  single elite  but  they  do  not  claim  that  such  societies are
egalitarian. Some groups have more influence on social affairs than others, but the several
groups do not coalesce. . . . The argument of pluralists such as [Robert] Dahl is, then, that
in advanced democratic societies political decisions will tend to be influenced by a number
of elites.
## [104]
Pluralist social scientists often acknowledge that technically skilled or
professionally trained managers have  displaced owners as  the  dominant
element in large corporations, and they thus subscribe to one version of the
theory of the managerial revolution in opposition to the power elite school.
They deny, however, that corporate managers display any significant unity
with the bureaucratic and cultural elites, and they point to the existence of
conflicts, disagreements, opposition, and competition among these elites as
evidence of a pluralistic dispersion of power. Pluralist arguments not only
are presented by social scientists but also underlie the “common sense”
view that the United States in particular and mass industrial democracies in
general display a  shifting, complex, mutually balancing arrangement of
political and social forces that prevents the consolidation of power by any
unified elite  and  guarantees political freedom. Thus,  Suzanne Keller,  a
leading pluralist theorist, argues for the existence in modern societies of
“strategic elites,” each performing specialized social functions, recruited on
the basis of merit and training rather than “sex, race, class, religion, or even
age,”
## [105]

and highly specialized in the skills with which they perform social
functions. She  sees  the  differentiations among strategic elites  as  a
progressive enhancement of social and political freedom.

Strategic elites,  representing specialized and  separate centers, find  their  power to  be
specialized and  limited. The  only  way  to  prevent abuses of  power is  to  control the
powerful, and  the  dispersion of  strategic  elites  constitutes such  a  control. The
heterogeneity of elites has also contributed to the decline of direct coercion and the rise of
persuasion, a striking characteristic of industrial societies. As the pressures making for
despotism have grown less intense, there is more hope of freedom under a system of
numerous, specialized, and morally differentiated strategic elites than under systems of
aristocracies and ruling classes.
## [106]
Pluralists are generally correct that competition and opposition among
contemporary elites exist, but they seriously exaggerate the degree of such
conflicts and  underestimate the  degree of  common interests that  unify
managerially and technically skilled elites. Keller, for example, accounts for
the supposed “heterogeneity” of elites in terms of the growth of population,
occupational specialization, formal organization or bureaucracy, and “moral
diversity”; “with the continuing operation of these four processes, elites
become more numerous, more varied, and more autonomous.”
## [107]
Increasingly,  those  who  supervise differentiated functions in  modern societies are
specialists in full-time jobs. . . . Specialization thus affects the strategic elites no less than
the general population and makes of that common centripetal core group a divided and
separate series  of  specialists. The  consequences of  this  are  the  greater autonomy and
independence of  these  elites, their  smaller  degree of  cohesion, and  the  decreasing
likelihood that any single elite can long exert absolute, arbitrary power.
## [108]
Keller and  other  pluralists, however,  fail  to  see  that  although
specialization—the acquisition of  managerial and  technical skills—may
qualify an individual to perform a single specific function, the functions
themselves as well as the skills that perform them are often highly similar
or identical within the different mass organizations of the economy, the
state, and culture and communication, and that technically trained personnel
at all levels of influence may move from one such organization to another
to  perform such  functions. Such specialized functions as  public
administration, personnel management, public relations, and finance and
accounting are applicable to virtually any mass organization and permit a

high degree of interchangeability and integration among those elites that
possess the skills that perform them. Even more specialized skills in the
physical and biological sciences, law, economics, psychology and the social
sciences, computer science, and engineering yield entry to the managerial
elite in all of the mass organizations of the state, economy, and culture.
“Occupational specialization,” therefore, does  not  necessarily involve
separation or division among managerial and technical elites or contribute
to their heterogeneity.
Moreover,  those  who  acquire managerial and  technical skills  are
differentiated from those in society who do not acquire them, and, along
with their skills, such specialists also tend to acquire a set of interests and a
worldview that  distinguish them  from  and  place  them  in  significant
opposition to those who lack these skills. Since the skills of the specialists
yield power within the dominant mass organizations, the specialists emerge
as an elite unified around a set of common interests and common bonds that
divide it from other social groups contending for power.
These managerial interests consist  principally in  maintaining  and
extending the size, scope, and role of the mass organizations through which
all  managers acquire their  power  and  also  in  the  working out  of  the
implications of  this  extension in  the  state,  economy,  and  culture. These
implications include the fusion or integration of the mass organizations; the
homogenization of political, economic, cultural, and social differentiations
and  particularities and  an  accompanying centralization  of  functions and
authority in  the  mass  organizations; the  extension of  the  application of
managerial skills to  economic, political, and  social and  cultural
relationships and activities for the management of social change under the
disciplines of  mass  organizations;  the  adoption of  “meritocracy,”  in  the

sense of proficiency in managerial and technical skills, rather than status or
prescribed characteristics such as race, sex, age, religion, class, or moral
conformity as a criterion of upward mobility; and protracted opposition to
the  power,  institutions, and  ideology of  the  bourgeois  elite  as  the  main
antagonist of and constraint upon managerial dominance. These common
interests of the managerial elite are carried out in the public policies and
legislation of  the  managerial state,  in  the  economic activities  of  the
managerial corporations, and  in  the  ideology articulated in  a  variety of
forms by the managerial intelligentsia in the mass organizations of culture
and communication.
Pluralists are correct, however, that the managerial elite is not uniform.
It  must  sometimes compromise with  non-managerial forces, and  many
managers, due to cultural inertia or personality, do not always pursue their
group  interests consistently or  in  the  same  way.  At  the  local  level  of
political decision-making, as  Robert Dahl  and  other  pluralist political
scientists have argued, managerial elites may exert little power and may
have  to  compete with  bourgeois  elites. Despite these  qualifications,
however, managerial groups at the national level of political, economic, and
cultural power in the managerial state, the economy, or the mass cultural
organizations are generally united on the interests that they share, generally
espouse an ideology that recognizes and rationalizes these interests, and
generally do not support, or actively oppose, ideologies and movements
perceived as contrary to their interests.
Keller writes that
The President of the United States, the president of a giant corporation, the top atomic
scientist, and the leading writer of an era have little in common beyond their general
cultural backgrounds and their achievement of prominence. How they arrived at their pre-
eminent positions, what they must do to remain there, and how they affect the lives and
fortunes of other men through the exercise of their functional responsibilities, differ for

each.
## [109]
Yet the president of the United States, in order to become and remain
president, must  depend on  a  mass  political organization operated and
controlled by  managers and  technicians skilled in  the  management and
manipulation of  voters, campaigns, elections, conventions, propaganda,
finances, and other political forces of mammoth scale and complexity. As
president, he  also  must  depend on  the  managerial bureaucracy for  the
leadership of the national government itself, even if he himself lacks the
skills  and  expertise the  bureaucracy possesses. Similarly,  a  corporate
president must himself be skilled in the managerial techniques that yield
control of the corporation. The atomic scientist must not only master the
highly technical field of nuclear physics and related scientific fields but also
exhibit organizational skills  in  administering large  and  capital-intensive
laboratories and a large and highly skilled work force. Even “the leading
writer of an era” probably must understand not only the technical skills
pertaining to his own craft but also the techniques of publishing, promotion,
and salesmanship for a mass market dominated by mass organizations, and
even if the writer himself is oblivious to such arcana, his agent and his
publishers will be knowledgeable in them. Thus, the leaders in politics and
government, the economy, science, and literary culture are all dependent on
and perhaps themselves skilled in the managerial techniques necessary for
dominance in  a  mass  society,  and  this  common dependence implies a
common interest among them in maintaining and extending the size, scope,
and power of mass organizations in the state, economy, and culture and in
preserving and enhancing the social rewards of the elites that direct and
control them.
Exponents of  the  pluralist argument often  point  to  the  traditionally
hostile relationship between “government” and “business” as evidence that

the elites of each sector are not unified but possess contrary and opposing
interests. As Daniel Bell  puts  it,  “the  economic managers and  the  state
bureaucracy .  .  .  are  often  quite  distinct and  even  at  odds  with  each
other,”
## [110]
and Arnold M. Rose, writing in the 1960s, argued that
The economic elite in fact does often expound its wishes—in the programs and campaigns
of the National Association of Manufacturers, the United States Chamber of Commerce,
and more specialized groups such as the American Medical Association. . . . the President
and the majority of the Congress more often go against these programs than support them,
although the  businessmen are  more  likely  to  get  their  way  when  they  seek  narrow
economic advantages  from  the  independent  regulatory commissions and  the  military
procurement agencies.
## [111]
Yet, while there is considerable disagreement between businessmen and
government bureaucrats about  particular kinds  of  economic policy and
regulation, there is also an underlying consensus between corporate and
bureaucratic managerial elements on  the  need  for  a  close  relationship
between the economic and political orders.
Political conflicts in the United States since the early 20th century have
often revolved around the issue of the relationship between government and
business. This conflict has been basic to the political ideologies of both the
left and the right, the former regarding the state as the proper regulator of
business excesses and the guarantor of economic prosperity and justice and
the latter regarding the state as the potential or actual enemy of legitimately
private economic activity.  Opposition to  government intervention in  the
economy,  however,  has  been  far  less  noticeable among corporate
managerial elements than  among those  business elements drawn from
bourgeois or  entrepreneurial  backgrounds. The  conflict  between
“government” and “business” is in fact a reflection of the conflict between
the managerial and bourgeois orders at the political and ideological levels,
and it is not in reality a conflict between “government” and “business” but
between the unified managerial elites of state and economy on the one hand

and the bourgeois elite in the entrepreneurial firms and jurisdictions at the
local levels, on the other. There is no serious conflict of interests between
the managerial elite in the state and that in the corporations.
One  of  the  principal interests on  which the  managerial elites  in
government and corporations are united involves the fusion or integration
of state and economy. Despite the opposition of bourgeois business interests
to extensive governmental involvement in the economy, since the early 20th
century the  managerial elite  of  the  corporations has  supported such
intervention. “The  novelty of  the  early  20th  century,”  writes historian
Robert Higgs, “was the undisguised position taken by a growing number of
businessmen (especially among the Eastern elite) that government should
intervene more actively in the affairs of business (particularly big corporate
business) and  that  the  intervention should be  ongoing and
institutionalized.”
## [112]
By the end of World War II, the advantages of the
integration of economy and state were apparent to most of the corporate
managerial elite. As Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. notes,
By the 1950s, however, businessmen in general and professional managers in particular
had  begun  to  see  the  benefits of  a  government commitment to  maintaining aggregate
demand. They supported the efforts of both Democratic and Republican administrations
during the recessions of 1949, 1957, and 1960 to provide stability through fiscal policies
involving the building of highways and shifting defense contracts. . . . The protest against
the new type of business enterprise was led by merchants, small manufacturers, and other
businessmen, including commercial farmers, who felt their economic interests threatened
by the new institution [i.e., the large corporation]. By basing their arguments on traditional
ideology and traditional economic beliefs, they won widespread support for their views.
Yet in the end, the protests, the political campaigns, and the resulting legislation did little
to retard the continuing growth of the new institution and the new class that managed it.
## [113]
The resistance to the evolving fusion of state and economy was thus led
not by managerial forces but by the smaller entrepreneurial and bourgeois
firms that correctly perceived the fusion as a threat to their own interests.
John  Kenneth Galbraith also  notes  the  correlation between managerial

corporations and  a  positive attitude toward state  regulation, on  the  one
hand, and entrepreneurial firms and leaders and a negative reaction to such
intervention, on the other.
The opposition to the rising power of the state in the decisive years of the thirties, like the
opposition to the rising power of the unions, was led not by the mature corporations but by
the surviving entrepreneurs. The names of Ernest Weir, Thomas Girdler, Henry Ford, the
Du Ponts and Sewell Avery are associated with this resistance. General Motors, General
Electric, U.S.  Steel and other mature corporations were much more inclined to accept such
innovations as  NRA, to  be  more  philosophical about  Roosevelt  and  otherwise to
accommodate themselves to the New Deal.
## [114]
G. William Domhoff also notes the differentiation in attitudes toward
state intervention in the economy between larger (i.e., managerial or, in
Galbraith’s term, “mature”) corporations and the smaller firms that retain
their bourgeois or entrepreneurial character, although Domhoff, consistent
with his view of the bourgeois nature of the elite, sees no fundamental
cleavage between the two. Discussing the differences between members of
the National Association of  Manufacturers (NAM) and  those  of  the
Committee for Economic Development (CED), he writes
A  study  from  the  1960s showed that  the  businesspeople who  were  most  isolationist,
antiwelfare and antilabor were more likely to be in NAM and to be associated with smaller
and more regional corporations. Those who were more moderate [i.e., less hostile to state
intervention] were  more  likely  to  be  in  CED  and  to  manage larger  companies. More
recently, our study of the corporate interlocks of CED and NAM leaders revealed the same
large/small dichotomy. For example, NAM’s directors for 1972 had only 9 connections to
the top 25 banks, whereas CED had 63. Similarly, NAM had but 10 connections to the 25
largest industrials, while CED had 48. The findings were similar for insurance, transport,
utilities and retails.
## [115]
And in a more recent work, Domhoff has written, “There is a tendency
for the moderate organizations [that shape public policy] to be directed by
executives from  the  very  largest  and  most  internationally oriented of
corporations, but there are numerous exceptions to that generalization,” and
in regard to the foundations that affect economic policy, “Unlike the large
foundations in the moderate part of the network, all of the very conservative

foundations are under the direct control of the original donating family.”
## [116]
The “hostility between business and government” therefore seems to be
largely a hostility of bourgeois or entrepreneurial firms and leaders to the
managerial state and its economic policies. The latter tend to be supported,
however, by the managerial elite in the mass corporation. Although there
are clearly conflicts between the managerial elites in state and corporation
—conflicts over  the  degree or  kind  of  intervention, for  example—there
appears to  be  a  consensus or  unity  between them  that  state  economic
intervention is desirable and in fact beneficial to the corporate managers of
the economic sector and their interests. Managerial elites in both the mass
state and the mass corporation thus behave similarly with respect to this
interest and  to  interests related to  it.  This  unity  therefore considerably
reduces the  degree to  which,  in Daniel Bell’s  words, “the  economic
managers and the state bureaucracy . . . are often quite distinct and even at
odds with each other.”
Arnold Rose’s view that political authorities override the interests of the
“economic elite” is based largely on his identification of the “economic
elite”  with  both  managerial and  entrepreneurial-bourgeois  elements. The
National Association of  Manufacturers and  the  U.S.  Chamber of
Commerce, which Rose asserted to expound the “wishes” of the economic
elite, have historically represented the interests of the bourgeois economic
elite, while, as Domhoff pointed out in an extended critique of Rose, the
American Medical Association cannot be considered part of any economic
elite.
## [117]
That  the  bureaucratic elite  of  the  managerial state  frustrates
bourgeois economic and business interests does not establish the existence
of  a  conflict of  interests between the  managerial elites  of  the  state  and
economy.  Moreover,  Rose  clearly  acknowledged the  differentiation of

interests between the managerial and bourgeois elements of his “economic
elite,” though his conclusion failed to take account of the differences.
[T]here are distinct subgroups within the economic elite, although occasionally they can
work together in unity and with deliberateness for a common goal. Perhaps especially on
economic issues there are divergences of interest. . . . In general, one of the great cleavages
in  interest  and  power that  runs  through American history is  that  between the  “big”
businessmen and the “small” businessmen. In the twentieth century, big business fell into
the  hands of  well-educated managers and  specialists such  as  lawyers, while  small
businessmen were more likely to remain “self-made men” with lesser education. “Small”
businessmen in the twentieth century often consolidated considerable amounts of wealth,
but usually retained control in a single family or partnership; big businesses invariably
became corporations with a number of important owners, directors, and managers. These
differences were expressed in all kinds of political and economic issues, and even though
most of the time both groups could find common political interest expressed through the
Republican Party (after about 1875) there remained a deep cleavage running through the
Republican Party itself. The split between Robert Taft and Dwight Eisenhower, or between
Goldwater  and  the  Scranton-Rockefeller forces are  merely the  better-known recent
examples of this cleavage.
## [118]
If “small” (i.e., bourgeois) businessmen can work together with “big”
managerial businessmen only  “occasionally .  .  .  in  unity  and  with
deliberateness for a common goal,” then Rose’s “economic elite” cannot be
said to constitute a unified elite in any significant sense.
Rose was correct in concluding that “Especially since the 1930s, the
government has set various restrictions and controls on business, and has
heavily taxed business and the public to carry out purposes deemed to be
for the general good—welfare programs, education programs, highways,
war and military defense activities, etc.,”
## [119]
but he also acknowledged that
“Small business, rather than big business, has been the main source of the
recent opposition  to  liberal legislation and  the  principal upholder of
conservatism generally,”
## [120]
and he nowhere established a significant and
enduring opposition to government intervention in the economy by “big”
managerial interests or  any  conflict of  interests between the  managerial
elites of the state and economy. These elites share a common interest in

encouraging and sustaining government economic intervention, and both
are in conflict with the interests of the bourgeois elite, which has sought to
restrict economic intervention by the state.
The essential unity between the managerial elites of the corporation and
the  state  with  respect to  the  fusion of  state  and  economy  is  closely
connected to their common interests in the continuing enlargement of mass
political and economic organizations and in breaking down the constraints
on enlargement that compact and small-scale bourgeois institutions present.
The  alliance  of  the  corporation with  the  state  facilitates the  corporate
absorption of smaller competitors, the control of mass markets, and the
regulation of aggregate demand, while the enlargement and centralization of
the state itself is assisted by the economic and social homogenization that
managerial capitalism encourages. Moreover, the managerial elites of both
the state and the corporation acquire dominance through their technical and
administrative skills and through the centralized planning and consolidation
that these skills permit. Both the managerial elites of the corporation and of
the state also share an interest in encouraging and managing continuous
social, economic, and  political change and  innovation through the
application of their technical and administrative skills to social processes
and  relationships.  These and  other  common interests of  the  managerial
elites  of  the  state  and  corporation  not  only  serve  to  unify  them  in  the
consolidation and  fusion of  political and  economic power but  also  to
distinguish them  from  the  bourgeois  elite  and  its  interests, which
historically have resisted the enlargement of the state and the concentration
of social, economic, and political power in mass organizations. Pluralist
arguments tend  to  ignore or  deny  the  common interests that  unify
managerial elites  in  state  and  corporation and  which differentiate these
elites from their bourgeois rivals. The mass organizations in the state and

economy are  less  competitive centers of  power than  they  are  common
depositories of  power from  which  a  unified elite  can  gain  advantages
against its bourgeois antagonists.
In addition to the supposed opposition between elites in the state and the
economy, the pluralist thesis also gains some plausibility from the apparent
disunity or conflict between the intellectual, verbalist, and cultural elites, on
the one hand, and the political and economic elites, on the other. Lionel
Trilling’s idea of an “adversary culture” of intellectuals and artists who
believe “that  a  primary function of  art  and  thought is  to  liberate the
individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to
permit him  to  stand  beyond it  in  an  autonomy of  perception and
judgment”
## [121]
has been popularized and expanded by a number of more
recent writers such  as Daniel Bell, Irving Kristol,  and  other
“neoconservatives” who are highly critical of the “adversary culture.” The
intellectual, verbalist, and  cultural elite  includes writers and  artists,
academics and teachers, scientists, clergymen, many lawyers, journalists,
actors  and  entertainers, and  in  general those  who  make  their  living  by
means of writing, speaking, research, intellectual and aesthetic creativity,
and communication. If indeed this intelligentsia is a part of the managerial
elite, and if it displays adversarial attitudes toward the managerial regime,
then there is a significant disunity within that regime.
There can be no doubt that the intelligentsia is part of the managerial
elite. Whether intellectuals work in the corporate sector (for the mass media
of publishing, newspapers and periodicals, broadcasting, or film), in the
tax-exempt public sector (large foundations, schools and universities, and
mass  churches), or  in  the  government itself,  their  livelihood and  social
functions in  mass  society depend upon  managerially directed mass

organizations, and they are a highly rewarded and often dominant part of
these  organizations. Moreover,  as  Galbraith,  Bell,  and  others have
emphasized, the  managerial economy and  state  are  dependent upon  the
educational, research, and  communicational skills  of  the  intelligentsia,
without which managerial skills could not be imparted nor the managerial
ideologies disseminated throughout mass society. In some professions, the
material and  psychic rewards of  the  intelligentsia are  even  greater than
those  of  most  corporate executives, and  even  in  the  more  modestly
remunerated academy,  the  intellectuals occupy a  uniquely privileged,
secure, high status, and occasionally lucrative and powerful position in the
managerial regime. Surveying the “media elite” of major news and opinion
outlets in the 1980s, Stanley Rothman and Robert S. Lichter found that the
media elite  is  composed of  “highly educated, well-paid professionals.
Ninety-three percent have college degrees, and a majority attended graduate
school as well. These figures reveal them to be one of the best-educated
groups in America,”
## [122]
and the media elite is distinguished in its social
background from “middle Americans.”
In sum, substantial numbers of the media elite grew up at a distance from the social and
cultural traditions of small-town middle America. Instead, they came from big cities in the
northeast and north central states. Their parents were mostly well off, highly educated
members of the upper middle class, especially the educated professions. In short, they are
a highly cosmopolitan group, with differentially eastern, urban, ethnic, upper-status, and
secular roots.
## [123]
That there exists an adversarial relationship to some parts of society on
the part of the intelligentsia is also clear. In the past, the intellectual and
verbalist elite has harbored an unusual degree of sympathy for political,
economic, social,  moral, aesthetic, and  philosophical doctrines that
challenge many of the values and institutions of “mainstream” society. Such
ideologies in  the  20th  century have  included Marxism  and  its  several
revisionist varieties, democratic socialism, existentialism, religious

skepticism, ethical and cultural relativism, various forms of psychoanalysis,
and a number of modernist or post-modernist aesthetic and literary styles,
most recently “deconstructionism.” Even when intellectuals do not adhere
rigorously to  a  particular adversarial doctrine, they  often  exhibit a
generalized skepticism toward the values and institutions of mainstream
society, take part in or support movements that are hostile toward such
values and  institutions, and  enjoy  or  share  satirical or  hostile  attitudes
toward them. The hostility of intellectual and verbalist elites toward the
mainstream of American society was especially pronounced in the 1930s,
when membership in  or  sympathy for  communist causes  was  not
uncommon among intellectuals, and in the 1960s, during the Vietnam war,
when many intellectuals expressed radical or revolutionary attitudes toward
American society and  its  dominant institutions and  values and  in  some
cases became affiliated with violent or extra-legal political movements.
Yet the adversarial culture of the intellectual and verbalist elite and its
alienation from, hostility to, and even hatred of American institutions and
values are not for the most part directed against the ideologies, imperatives,
interests, mentality, or modes of behavior characteristic of the managerial
regime or its elite, but rather at the persistence of bourgeois values and
institutions, the  power and  cultural influence of  which the  intelligentsia
often exaggerates. Trilling himself noted the anti-bourgeois thrust of the
adversary culture and spoke of “its old antagonist, the middle class” and
“the legend of the free creative spirit at war with the bourgeoisie.”
## [124]
## Bell
also remarks on “the historic, subversive effect [of the adversary culture] on
traditional bourgeois values,” and Kristol comments that “It is hardly to be
denied that the culture that educates us . . . is unfriendly (at the least) to the
commercial civilization, the bourgeois civilization, within which most of us
live  and  work.”
## [125]
As  with  the  conflict between  the  “state” and  the

“economy,” then, the antagonism of the managerial intelligentsia represents
not  a  conflict or  disunity within the  managerial elite  but  rather a
confrontation between a part of the managerial elite and the vestiges of the
bourgeois order that have persisted in the mass organizations of the state,
economy, and culture and communication, despite the emergence within
these  organizations of  managerial  elites  and  the  dominance of  their
interests. The antagonism of the managerial intelligentsia toward persistent
bourgeois elements is closely connected to the interests that the intellectual
and verbalist elite of the regime shares with the managerial elites in the
state and economy.
In the economy, the principal forms of antagonism that the managerial
intelligentsia expresses include a critique of private property, or at least of
its abuses through greed, exploitation, corruption, waste, and ostentation,
and of an economic system (entrepreneurial capitalism) based on the profit
motive. Both this system and the abuses of its central institution of private
property are characteristic of the bourgeois order and the economy that its
elite controlled. The reliance of entrepreneurial capitalism on hard property,
privately owned and managed, and the autonomy that large concentrations
of  privately owned and  operated property afforded to  the  bourgeois
propertied elite was a principal source of the power of the bourgeois elite as
well  as  of  the  abuses to  which  the  managerial intelligentsia  objects. In
criticizing and  rejecting the  economic system of  the  bourgeois  order,
however, the managerial intelligentsia not only repudiates the abuses of the
entrepreneurial economy but also challenges the ideological supports of the
bourgeois  elite  and  enhances the  dominance of  managerial elites. The
managerial intelligentsia displays far less hostility to the dematerialization
of property and its consequences and to the fusion of state and economy
that characterize the managerial economy, and it generally welcomes the

prevalence of managerial elements within the economy at the expense of
the bourgeois elite. The intelligentsia is critical of the managerial economy
in  so  far  as  its  institutions (corporations and  labor  unions and  their
relationship with the state) permit bourgeois and entrepreneurial elements to
persist and flourish.
The  intelligentsia also  displays an  adversarial attitude toward certain
policies and habits of the state (e.g., toward secrecy, censorship, appeals to
nationalism, reliance on force and punishment to resolve conflicts, and the
lack  of  commitment to  social  change by  the  state), but  these  also  are
features of pre-managerial political institutions that have persisted in the
managerial regime. The  bourgeois  state  presided over  and  protected a
particularistic and localized order in which national rivalry required secrecy
and war, in which censorship and coercive punishment were useful for the
suppression of  ideological and  criminal challenges, and  in  which state
sponsorship of  social change  was  held  to  be  undesirable  and  even
threatening. These characteristics of the bourgeois state block or jeopardize
the interests and aspirations of the managerial intelligentsia, as they do the
emergence of  a  managerial bureaucratic elite  in  the  state,  and  their
persistence in the managerial state is the object of the adversarial critique of
the managerial intellectual and verbalist elite.
Thus, the managerial intelligentsia is highly critical of the use of war
and force by the state. The expenses and demands of war tend to restrict the
resources and attention to which both the intelligentsia and the state have
access and  which are  necessary to  working out  the  managerial agenda
internally through social reconstruction. War also involves a re-assertion of
bourgeois and nationalistic values and, through conscription, threatens the
security and life styles and indeed the very autonomy of the intelligentsia.

War  threatens to  promote and  reward skills  that  are  not  derived from
managerial and technical expertise but are associated with pre-managerial
values, modes of  behavior,  and  institutions (personal bravery,  skill  in
combat, the deferral of gratification and the willingness for self-sacrifice).
## [126]
Similarly, the reliance of the state on coercion for the suppression of
internal conflict or the use of coercive retributive punishment of criminality
presents an obstacle to the interests of the managerial intelligentsia and its
aspiration to replace coercive functions with its own functions of managing
social and economic reconstruction and therapy. The use of secrecy and
censorship by  the  state  jeopardizes the  social  and  cultural role  of  the
intelligentsia and threatens to constrain its cultural dominance by limiting
its central function of managing education and research and manipulating
an “open society” of public discussion and debate of policies, ideas, and
values. The elimination or reduction of the role of the state in managing
social change also reduces the functions of the managerial intelligentsia in
designing and implementing change and frustrates the rewards that such
functions yield.
The hostility, antagonism, and adversarial attitudes of the managerial
intelligentsia toward the state is in fact highly selective, and the principle
that seems to govern its selectivity is not arbitrary but appears to reflect the
interests of  the  intellectual and  verbalist class.  The  intelligentsia is  not
hostile to  the  universalism and  internationalism that  characterize the
policies of the managerial state nor to the reliance of the state on managerial
skills to rehabilitate criminals, resolve conflicts, and contain and manipulate
ideological challenges. The intelligentsia displays no adversarial attitudes
toward the  managerial state  for  its  regulation of  business and  property

relations or its involvement in social, economic, and cultural change, nor
toward the centralization of functions and authority that such involvement
requires. Nor  does  it  object to  the  fusion of  state  and  culture  through
governmental endowment and  sponsorship of  the  arts,  humanities, and
sciences, and governmental assistance to education. These characteristics of
the managerial state are consistent with the interests and aspirations of the
managerial intellectual and verbalist elite, though they were lacking in the
more limited and neutralist bourgeois state. The managerial intelligentsia
also  favors the  continuing enlargement and  dominance of  mass
organizations in the state and economy and particularly in the culture and
the  prevalence of  managerial and  technical elites (including the
intelligentsia itself) within these organizations. As with other parts of the
managerial elite  in  the  state  and  economy,  the  managerial intelligentsia
gains power and economic and social rewards from its role and functions
within the mass organizations and possesses an interest in enhancing their
size, scale, and power. Its adversarial role is therefore strictly limited and is
confined to those structures and functions that conflict with its interests; it
is supportive of those structures and functions that are consistent with its
interests.
Perhaps the most adversarial attitudes of the managerial intelligentsia
are directed against the persistence of the social, cultural, religious, and
moral codes  of  the bourgeois  order,  especially against its  “domestic
ethic”—the valuation of the bourgeois virtues of work, thrift, integrity, self-
restraint, and loyalty to the bourgeois institutions and roles that enforce
such  virtues (family,  community,  nation, ethnicity,  sexual roles,  church,
local  government, and  the  entrepreneurial firm). This  adversarial
relationship to  bourgeois  social codes also  reflects the  interests and
aspirations of  the  intelligentsia, which finds  its  own  meritocratic and

rationalistic values  and  mentality and  its  opportunities for  social and
political rewards and upward social mobility constrained or contradicted by
the prevalence of the bourgeois ethic. The criticism and rejection of the
bourgeois  domestic ethic  by  the  managerial intelligentsia (in  ideologies
such as Marxism, progressive education, psychoanalysis, and behaviorism,
among others) is  central to  the  popularization of  mass hedonism, of
“alternative” sexual behavior and mores,  of  anti-bourgeois  social and
economic theories  in  which work  and  thrift  are  less  important than
immediate material  gratification  and  consumption, and  of  efforts  by  the
managerial state and its allies to reform and “restructure” the family and
local community around less “restrictive” values and behavior.
Indeed, the  intelligentsia as  a  whole is  supportive of  the  basic
managerial ideologies  of  hedonism, meliorism or  utopianism, scientism,
and cosmopolitanism and is largely responsible for their formulation and
dissemination. Hedonistic and cosmopolitan themes are popularized by the
critique of the domestic ethic and of particular institutional loyalties and
identities and by the relativism implicit in the environmentalist ideology
that rejects the “repressive” nature of bourgeois society and rationalizes the
design and management of social change. Meliorism and utopianism as well
as scientism are  formulated in  the  demand of  the  intelligentsia that  the
managerial state  employ its  power and  resources for  the  design and
implementation of social change in accordance with scientific and socially
rationalistic premises and values. The managerial intelligentsia therefore is
closely involved in and obtains significant social and political rewards from
the  ideological rationalization of  the  managerial regime and  the
delegitimization of the bourgeois order.
There is in fact no aspect of the managerial regime as such to which the

intellectuals display any significant hostility, and there are many aspects of
the regime of which it appears to approve and has a material interest in
supporting and promoting.
To be sure, there are policies and actions by corporate managers and
state  bureaucrats to  which the  intelligentsia objects, and  in  objecting to
them  and  mobilizing a  critique  of  them  intellectuals often  serve  as  the
“conscience” of  the  managerial elite.  In  this  respect the  intelligentsia
performs a role as a kind of “vanguard” of the managerial elite, exhibiting a
superior,  more  strategic, and  more  long-range understanding of  the
dynamics, ideology, and imperatives of the managerial regime as a whole
than the more pragmatic elites of state and economy, which must often
compromise or become entangled with bourgeois remnants. The managerial
intelligentsia demands of  these  elites  a  continuing rejection of  and
challenge to  the  bourgeois vestiges that  persist within the  mass
organizations and a continuing extension of the regime to overcome and
transcend the remnants of the bourgeois order. These demands arise in part
from its own ideological consciousness but also from its interests as a social
force within the managerial regime and a component of the managerial
elite. The intelligentsia is concerned not merely “to liberate the individual
from the tyranny of his culture” but also to establish the dominance of its
own  culture, and  its  sympathy for  “progressive” causes—political and
social reform, economic redistribution, the extension of civil liberties and
the  end  of  censorship, pacifism, opposition to  racial and  sexual
discrimination—is  subordinate to  its  perception of  these  causes as
instruments of its own interests. As Alvin W. Gouldner argued in regard to
what he called the “New Class,” a social force essentially identical to the
managerial elite  and  which he  understood as  comprising  both  the
intellectuals and  the  “technical intelligentsia” (similar to Galbraith’s

## “techno-structure”),
The New Class, then, is prepared to be egalitarian so far as the privileges of the old class
[i.e., the bourgeoisie] are concerned. That is, under certain conditions it is prepared to
remove or restrict the special incomes of the old class: profits, rents, interest. The New
Class  is  anti-egalitarian, however,  in  that  it  seeks  special guild  advantages—political
powers and incomes—on the basis of its possession of cultural capital.
## [127]
In  so  far,  then,  as  the  intelligentsia in  mass  society constitutes an
adversary culture, it is adversarial to the bourgeois order, to its elite, its
social and moral codes and values, its institutions and power apparatus, its
characteristic political styles and modes of behavior, and the persistence of
these bourgeois elements within managerial organizations. The managerial
intelligentsia is not adversarial to the managerial regime, and indeed, it
typically couches  its  criticisms of  the  regime in  terms  of  the  bourgeois
order, thus exaggerating the power and persistence of the bourgeoisie and
effectually disguising the nature of the managerial elite. Thus, C. Wright
Mills  and  G. William  Domhoff  attribute social, political, and  economic
power to a “propertied elite” or “upper class” that is essentially continuous
with  bourgeois  elites  of  the  last  century and,  in  their  depiction, is  still
bourgeois in its ideologies and interests. While Mills and Domhoff display a
strong adversarial attitude toward this supposed bourgeois elite, they speak
more  respectfully  of  its  “moderate” components, which are  in  fact  the
dominant managerial element of  the  elite.  Domhoff,  for  example,
commenting on  the  differences between the  “moderate” (i.e.,  manager-
controlled) CED and  the  “ultraconservative” (i.e.,  bourgeois or
entrepreneurially controlled) NAM, writes
Most leaders within the committee would allow unions to exist, although they would like
them to be in an even weaker position than they are now. The association, on the other
hand, would like to smash them. The difference can also be seen in the fact that the
ultraconservatives would no more risk allowing professors to write an independent report
for them on this delicate topic than they would consider having the Communist Party write
one. The distinction is a subtle one, but it has manifested itself in a more reasonable
response by the moderates in times of extreme crisis and labor militancy.
## [128]

The real distinction between the attitudes of the managers and those of
the bourgeois interests toward unions, however, is not that the former is
more “reasonable” than the latter but that, in Galbraith’s words, “the mature
corporation, in the pursuit of its own goals, will accede far more readily
than  the  entrepreneurial enterprise to  the  demands of  the  union  and,
accordingly, is much less adverse to its existence,”
## [129]

or, in other words,
that it is in the interest of managerial corporations to accept labor unions
(which are  themselves mass  organizations) but  not  in  the  interest of
entrepreneurial firms to do so. The refusal of Mills and Domhoff and their
school to  understand the  significant distinction between the  interests of
managerial and entrepreneurial economic elites not only reveals their anti-
bourgeois and essentially pro-managerial bias but also serves to assimilate
their form of “radicalism” to the interests of the managerial regime. As
historian Christopher Lasch  notes in  a  different context, “cultural
radicalism, posing  as  a  revolutionary threat  to  the  status  quo,  in  reality
confines its  criticism to  values  already obsolescent and  to  patterns of
American capitalism that have long ago been superseded.”
## [130]
In  sum,  then,  there  are  no  fundamental antagonisms within the
managerial elite or among its sectors in state, economy, and media, though
there are, as in any elite, disagreements and sometimes rivalries. All three
sectors of the managerial elite agree on the need for and desirability of the
fusion of state and economy (as well as the fusion of state and culture), the
undermining of  the  power and  ideologies of  the  bourgeois  order,  the
expansion of the size and scope of mass organizations, the role and power
of  the  technically  skilled personnel who  operate and  direct such
organizations, and  the  rationalization and  popularization of  the  basic
managerial ideologies that  serve  to  challenge bourgeois  dominance and
persistence and to legitimize and integrate the managerial regime.

The Entrepreneurial Argument: Are the
Managers in Eclipse?
In the 1980s, a third school of criticism of the theory of the managerial
revolution developed in addition to the power elite and pluralist criticisms.
This new school, while often granting that something like a unified and
dominant managerial elite has held power in the United States for much of
this century, argues that economic and political changes in the United States
and the world during the 1980s have severely weakened the organizational
power of the elite and its regime. The adherents of this school, including
Paul Weaver, George Gilder, and John Naisbitt
## [131]
among others, argue that
smaller,  entrepreneurial firms are  displacing the  large  managerial
corporations and  through competition, innovative technologies, and
different corporate  structures are  rendering obsolete the  bureaucratized
economic-political order  of  the  managerial regime. In  government, they
point to the rise of new “populist” causes in the 1970s, and the success of
tax  reform, “supply side  economics,” and  deregulation in  the  Reagan
administration as evidence of the erosion of the power of the managerial
state. In the economy, they point not only to the emergence of a “new
entrepreneurialism” that  has  fostered computer,  bio-engineering, and
communications technologies that  larger  corporations have  ignored, but
also to intense Asian competition and corporate takeovers as new economic
forces that  are  obliging large  managerial corporations to  change their
internal structure and market strategies and behavior. Corporate raiding and
leveraged buy-outs show that corporations and their managerial elites are
not secure against pressures from stockholders, and to protect themselves
from stockholders’  revolts, foreign competitors, and  aggressive

entrepreneurs, large corporations and their managers have had to reduce the
size of their own labor force, eliminate even managerial personnel, close
down corporate departments, and reduce functions and expenses. With the
reduction of  governmental regulation of  the  economy in  the  1970s  and
1980s and  the  entry  of  new  competitors, the  oligopoly of  managerial
capitalism supposedly has  been  seriously compromised. Moreover,  as
Naisbitt and  other  prophets of  the  “new  corporation” have  argued,  the
“organization man” of the traditional managerial corporation is said to be
disappearing. Corporations now  supposedly allow  for  more  autonomy,
individual idiosyncrasy,  and  creativity within their  labor  forces,  and  the
increasing popularity of “home work” tends to break up the homogeneity
and  discipline that  corporate employment has  historically  involved.
Corporate employees no longer expect to work for the same organization
throughout their entire careers.
The  advocates of  “entrepreneurialism” criticize the  bureaucratic
corporations, unions,  and  government of  the  soft  regime for  impeding
economic growth and opportunity, and they point to a number of trends in
the  last  decade to  justify both  their  prediction and  their  defense of  an
incipient revolt against dominant structures and ideologies that encourage
economic and  cultural stagnation.  The  most  important such  trend,  they
argue,  is  the  efflorescence in  the  1970s and  1980s of  a  “new
entrepreneurialism” centered on  the  computer and  other advanced
information and communications technologies that corporate bureaucracies
were unable or unwilling to develop and which supposedly challenge the
dominance of mass organizations in the economy through the successful
competition of  smaller,  more  innovative, entrepreneurial firms. George
Gilder, perhaps the best known exponent of entrepreneurialism, argues that
the entrepreneurial virtues challenge and circumvent managerial values and

organizations, “that progress and achievement are the unpredictable result
of individual will and faith, diligence and ingenuity, against which all the
powers and principalities ultimately must stand impotent and in awe.”
In business as in art, the individual vision prevails over the corporate leviathan; the small
company—or the  creative group  in  a  large  firm—confounds the  industrial policy; the
entrepreneur dominates the hierarch. The hubristic determinisms of the academy and the
state—the secular monoliths of science and planning—give way to one man working in
the corner of a lab or a library.
## [132]
Political scientist Paul Weaver also is sanguine about “the twilight of the
corporate state,” the interdependent sectors of government and economy,
and he argues that the fused corporate-governmental apparatus described by
James Burnham and John Kenneth Galbraith is actually disintegrating under
the impact of new domestic and international competition.
Within the span of a single generation, in sector after economic sector, the suffocating,
tightly controlled world described by Galbraith has become a fading memory. Today the
invisible hand, not the visible one, is the dominant power in the economy. Markets rather
than industrial policy or management govern the fate of economic institutions and the flow
and texture of economic life in almost every industry and region.
## [133]
Weaver  cites  competition from  foreign firms, the  declining role  of
organized labor,  and  changes in  the  size  of  plants and  in  management
structures as reasons for the evanescence of managerial capitalism.
The entrepreneurialists are correct that new enterpreneurial firms in the
last two decades have developed and marketed new technological products
that older, larger, more bureaucratized corporations failed to explore, and
they  also  are  correct  that  the  newer and  smaller firms  have  generated
employment and economic growth in the regions affected by their activities.
Yet while these entrepreneurial forces are often hostile to the dominance of
mass corporations and unions and their fusion with the state, they are not
incompatible with  the  structures and  functions of  the  soft  managerial
regime and do not represent a serious or unassimilable challenge to it.

Although individual entrepreneurs operate outside the  apparatus  of
managerial corporations and  labor unions, the  aspirations of  the
entrepreneurs themselves for growth and enlargement serve to assimilate
them  within the  apparatus. As  their  businesses grow,  their  production,
marketing, research, and other functions can be performed only through the
application of  managerial and  technical skills,  and  the  highly  technical
nature of the new technologies merely intensifies the need for such skills.
The new entrepreneurialism, then, if it is economically successful, does not
significantly depart from or reject managerial skills, forms, and methods, or
provide alternative methods of  organizing economic functions, and
successful entrepreneurial firms eventually come to rely on such skills. As
Peter Drucker observes, with reference to the transformation of McDonald’s
from an entrepreneurial to a managerial organization, “Management is the
new technology (rather than any specific new science or invention) that is
making the  American economy into  an  entrepreneurial  economy.
Entrepreneurship in society—and it is badly needed—requires above all
application of the basic concepts, the basic techné, of management to new
problems and new opportunities.”
[I]n the McDonald’s hamburger chain . . . management was being applied to what had
always been a hit-or-miss, mom-and-pop operation. McDonald’s first designed the end
product; then it redesigned the entire process of making it; then it redesigned or in many
cases invented the tools so that every piece of meat, every slice of onion, every bun, every
piece  of  fried  potato would be  identical, turned out  in  a  precisely timed  and  fully
automated process. Finally McDonald’s  studied what  “value” meant to  the  customer,
defined it as quality and predictability of product, speed of service, absolute cleanliness,
and  friendliness, then  set  standards for  all  of  these, trained for  them,  and  geared
compensation to them.
## [134]
The evolution of McDonald’s from an innovative entrepreneurial firm
into  a  mass  corporation operated  in  accordance with  managerial skills
applied to mass production and marketing through the homogenization of
the product as well as the routinization of its consumers suggests that the

processes and  consequences of  the  organizational enlargement of
entrepreneurial firms are not fundamentally different from those that pertain
to  managerial corporations, many  of  which themselves developed from
smaller entrepreneurial companies. As business reporter Steve Pearlstein
writes in The Washington Post, “the entrepreneurial movement has begun to
harvest some of the bitter fruits of its own success. It has been co-opted by
the corporate establishment it set out to topple, and—in the eyes of many—
corrupted by corporate raiders and junk bond traders who have made liberal
use of its vocabulary and moral suasion.”
## [135]
Moreover, so far from reversing the revolution of mass and scale or
providing alternative  means of  accommodating quantitatively massive
social and economic interactions, the new technologies of information and
communication are  in  demand precisely because they  facilitate the
management of mass interactions in the economy, government, and culture.
The applications of these technologies to mobilizing capital, organizing and
communicating information, and administering mass organizations increase
the demand for managerial and technical skills as well as the social rewards
and dominance of those social groups proficient in them. Nor would the
entrepreneurial production and  distribution of  these  technologies be
possible without the managerial infra-structures that provide the financial
assets, transportation and marketing facilities, and mass educational and
research organizations that  impart the  managerial and  technical skills
necessary for technological innovation and its economic organization. The
“new  entrepreneurialism,” then,  so  far  from  challenging or  presenting
alternatives to managerial capitalism, cannot operate successfully in a mass
economy without management and  the  mass  organizations to  which
managerial skills are necessary; and the new technologies produced by new
entrepreneurial firms depend upon and further enhance the dominance of

managerial skills  and  the  elite  that  uses  these skills. The  new
entrepreneurial forces are easily assimilated within the managerial regime,
and successful entrepreneurs become part of the soft managerial elite with
largely identical interests and aspirations.
In the context of the persistence of managerial forms of organization,
specific adaptations precipitated by leveraged buy-outs and other kinds of
corporate takeovers in the 1980s appear to be insignificant in their impact
on the mass scale and complexity of operations, the ability of managerially
and technically skilled elements to retain their control of mass economic
organizations, and the long-term, structural interests of such elites. While
particular managers and  managerial hierarchies lost  positions of  power
within corporate  structures and  the  structures themselves experienced
changes, these adaptations did not significantly modify the predominance of
mass organizations in the economy or the dominance of managerial elites
within them.  Indeed, in  many  respects, the  new  mass  structures  of  the
economy appear merely to have intensified managerial control.
Michael C. Jensen of the Harvard Business School argues that, due to
new techniques of corporate takeovers through the manipulation of debt and
a new aggressiveness on the part of those able to use these techniques,
The publicly held corporation, the main engine of economic progress in the United States
for a century, has outlived its usefulness in many sectors of the economy and is being
eclipsed. New organizations are emerging in its place—organizations that are corporate in
form but have no public shareholders and are not listed or traded on organized exchanges.
These organizations use public and private debt, rather than public equity, as their major
source of  capital. Their  primary owners are  not  households but  large  institutions  and
entrepreneurs that designate agents to manage and monitor on their behalf and bind these
agents with large equity interests and contracts governing the use and distribution of cash.
## [136]
The  evolution of  such  new  structures in  the  economy,  according to
Jensen, resolves “the conflict between owners and managers [in the public

corporation] over  the  control and  use  of  corporate resources”
## [137]
by
consolidating ownership into  the  hands  of  new  “primary owners” who
espouse what  Jensen calls  “investor activism.” Active investors are
“investors who  hold  large  equity or  debt  positions, sit  on  boards of
directors, monitor and sometimes dismiss management, are involved with
the  long-term strategic direction  of  the  companies they  invest  in,  and
sometimes manage the companies themselves.”
## [138]
Granted that  such  “investor activism” has  instigated changes  in  the
economic behavior of management and corporations, it nevertheless has not
challenged or modified the role of managerial elites in the economy or
altered the structural interests of such elites. While some of these “active
investors” in  the  1980s were  individual entrepreneurs who  revealed
extraordinary talents for aggressively mobilizing corporate takeovers and
acquired large fortunes doing so, the principal beneficiaries of “investor
activism” have been institutional—“insurance companies, pension funds,
and  money  management firms”—that are  themselves managerially
controlled. In 1988 the total values of corporate and governmental pension
funds exceeded $1.5 trillion and composed more than 40 percent of stock
ownership in  the  United States.
## [139]
Historically,  Jensen argues,  such
institutional investors have played a passive role in managing the corporate
assets they own, but “investor activism” is changing such passivity “by
purchasing entire companies—and using debt and high equity ownership to
force effective self-monitoring.”
## [140]
New organizations such as what Jensen
calls “LBO partnerships” are modifying the economic and organizational
behavior of corporate managers, and
More than any other factor, these organizations’ resolution of the owner-manager conflict
explains how they can motivate the same people, managing the same resources, to perform
so much more effectively under private ownership than in the publicly held corporate
form.
## [141]

Whatever the effect of such changes on the U.S. economy or on the
personal incentives of corporate managers, they are unlikely to diminish
managerial control of corporate enterprise, reduce the role of managerial
and  technical specialization in  the  economy and  society,  or  alter  the
structure and  functioning of  the  managerial regime. Despite the
consolidation of ownership into institutional hands, these institutions are
themselves under managerial control, and neither changes in ownership nor
from  “passive” to  “active” behavior reduce the  scale,  technicality,  and
complexity of  corporate operations. Regardless of  ownership and  legal
control, then,  functional control remains in  managerial hands, and  the
structural interests of managerial elites are not affected.
The changes in economic organization that Paul Weaver and Michael
Jensen discuss therefore represent  for  the  most  part  adaptations  of  the
managerial regime to  new  economic circumstances rather than  its
dismantlement. The  main  precipitants of  managerial dominance in  the
economy (as well as in the state and mass culture) have been the massive
enlargement of human numbers and the resulting increases in the scale of
economic, social, and political interactions, on the one hand, and, on the
other, the availability of technical and managerial skills by which mass
populations and their interactions can be organized and disciplined. These
conditions necessitate the administration of the economy, state, and culture
by managerial techniques, and the conditions persist in the 1990s. Although
managerial corporations, faced  with  entrepreneurial and  international
competition and threatened by takeovers, have eliminated personnel, jobs,
and functions and have adapted their structures to pursue more innovative
strategies, reduce costs, and motivate workers, corporate adaptations along
such lines do not significantly diminish the role of managerial elites within
the corporate structures, though they may alter the specific skills, units, and

routines by which the elites function. Despite these adaptations, managerial
corporations remain mass organizations that contain and discipline a vast
number of workers, produce goods and services for a mass market, and
coordinate economic functions and  interactions on  an  immense scale.
Managerial and technical skills are essential for performing the operations
—research and development, planning, production, marketing, and financial
and legal services, among others—that such dimensions of mass and scale
involve. The technological innovations and the global economic scale that
Weaver,  Gilder,  and  other  exponents of  entrepreneurialism defend will
intensify the complexity and further enlarge the scale of mass organizations
and  will  thus  increase rather  than  diminish the  need  for  managerial
dominance.
Weaver’s enthusiasm for the end of the managerial economy and its
fusion with  the  state  is  considerably qualified by  his  more  realistic
assessment of  the Reagan administration. Despite the  success of
deregulation and fiscal reform movements under the Reagan presidency and
the  presence of  bourgeois and  neo-entrepreneurial elements in  the
administration, the  Reagan era  accomplished little  substantial in  the
dismantlement of the managerial state or the re-direction of its policies. As
conservative sociologist Robert A. Nisbet noted,
Reagan promised, vowed, swore that the size of the bureaucracy and with it the size of the
national debt would be dramatically decreased. These promises came in the fall of 1980
and in the first months of 1981. But things changed. And it is recorded in the books of
Reagan’s own government, now in its second term, that his administration has presided
over  the  largest  budget increases and  the  largest  budget (and  also  trade)  deficits in
American history, and the size of the federal bureaucracy has shot up 13 percent, with not
one significant bureau or department, not even Energy or Education, despite promises,
dropped.
## [142]
In the post-Reagan era, writes Robert Higgs, the bulk of the expanded
managerial state of the Great Society era remained intact,

And the most significant elements—Medicare, Medicaid, environmental and occupational
safety regulations, consumer-protection and  antidiscrimination laws,  and  the  political
forces to  sustain all  these  programs—seem solidly established. The  ideology that
dominated the late sixties and early seventies is presently in retreat, but far from defeated.
Whatever else the so-called Reagan Revolution may have done, it certainly did not bring
about an ideological revolution.
## [143]
Weaver  acknowledges that  “Behind the  talk  of  free  markets and
traditional values, Reaganism in  practice consisted mostly of  career
advancement for Administration members along  with  the  usual  interest-
group  politics,” and  that  Reagan helped to  consolidate the  managerial
regime—“he effected a reconciliation between the American people and the
corporate state”
## [144]
—rather than challenge it, much as Presidents Truman
and Eisenhower consolidated the regime after the period of its emergence in
the New Deal and World War II era. Weaver also argues, however, that
Reagan’s  consolidation of  the  regime was  ephemeral and  that  the  anti-
managerial tendencies the president succeeded in disciplining during his
administrations would persist and re-emerge after his departure from office.
After Reagan there will be no Reaganism. When the man is no longer a sectarian candidate
or charismatic President, the factions that make up his movement will fall out of bed, go
their separate and divergent ways, and start fighting each other with new intensity.
## [145]
The failure of the Reagan administration to reduce the size and scope of
the managerial state or to develop alternative forms of social and political
discipline in itself suggests that even the anti-managerial entrepreneurial
forces that found in “Reaganism” a formula expressing their political and
economic aspirations are not sufficiently powerful as a significant social
force to initiate and consolidate an enduring revolt against the managerial
regime or to displace its dominance in the state, economy, and culture.
The entrepreneurialists may be correct that managerial capitalism, fused
with the mass state and centered on the mass corporation and labor union, is
unable to sustain technological innovation and economic growth and that

restructuring of  mass  organizations to  permit the  infusion  of  an
entrepreneurial ethos is necessary for the further encouragement of growth
and innovation. The organizational restructuring that the entrepreneurialists
envision, however,  is  merely a  reform of  the  regime that  promises the
enhancement of its power, and not a challenge to it. In this respect, the
entrepreneurialist ideology resembles the  “neoconservatism” that  also
sought to  reform and  consolidate the  managerial regime rather than
challenge it in accordance with bourgeois conservative aims, and whatever
the intentions of its exponents, the objective result of entrepreneurialism has
been the consolidation of the regime and not its dismantlement.
## [146]

## Neither
the  entrepreneurial activity of  the  1980s nor  the  adaptations of  the
managerial state and economy in the Reagan era led to the development of
serious challenges or alternatives to the dominance of mass organizations or
their control by managerial and technical skills.
If  new  entrepreneurial economic and  technological forces do  not
represent a  serious challenge to  managerial dominance but  are  rather
instruments by which managerial elites can adapt to new circumstances and
enhance their power,  neither is  the  ideological formula of
entrepreneurialism sufficiently distinct from the soft managerial worldview
to constitute a challenge to it or to resist the assimilation of entrepreneurial
elements by the regime. While George Gilder and other entrepreneurialists
articulate a  number of  bourgeois  or  post-bourgeois  values—hard work,
individual initiative, and the value of family and other social and personal
disciplines—and reject, on  a  formal level,  the  planning, collective and
bureaucratic disciplines, and  ethic  of  immediate gratification  associated
with the soft regime, they also express or harbor a number of values that are
consistent with  managerial hedonism and cosmopolitanism. The
entrepreneurialist idolization of  global economic and  technological

interdependence, the  transcendence of  national and  cultural distinctions,
and  unrestricted  international trade  and  immigration incorporate the
cosmopolitan ideology and  ethic  of  the  soft  managerial worldview,  and
Gilder’s  emphasis on  individuality,  economic opportunity,  affluence,
economic growth, social mobility, and technological and social change offer
no  resistance to  managerial hedonism and  an  economy oriented toward
mass consumption and gratification. Gilder praises what Joseph Schumpeter
called the “process of creative destruction,” by which capitalism promotes
economic, social, and  technical  change, yet  he  offers  no  response to
Schumpeter’s  thesis that  this  same  process encourages the  eventual
decomposition of the institutional and ideological fabric—hard property, the
family, the bourgeois ethic—in which capitalism flourishes.
## [147]
Nor does
Gilder seem to perceive that the economic and technological innovations of
the new entrepreneurs serve to reinforce the mass economy and culture of
consumption and gratification and to accelerate the deracination of social
bonds and personal disciplines.
Gilder’s  enthusiasm for  the  new  technologies often  approaches the
utopian and melioristic formulas of soft managerial ideology. “There is no
way to fathom the full potential of this technology, now in its Promethean
infancy,” he writes.
In  conjunction  with  other  advances it  is  already transforming the  world  of  work  and
forging at last the long predicted age of computers, just as the steam engine and the
railroads inaugurated the industrial age. It is possible to disparage this development and to
deride its enthusiasts, to point to inevitable problems and to fantasize chimerical threats of
“dehumanizing” machines and  Frankenstein robots. But  this  technology,  coolly
considered, bears no such menace at all, while it offers, to nations that pursue its promise,
gains quite incalculable, even by the machines themselves.
## [148]
The  less  attractive potentials of  the  new  technologies of  computers,
satellite communications, microbiology,  and  lasers for  more  efficient
political repression, regimentation, military aggression, and psychological

and biological manipulation do not occur to Gilder, and his expectations of
the progressive effects of these technologies on social arrangements and
relationships recapitulate the scientism as  well  as  the meliorism of  the
managerial worldview.
Both the entrepreneurial economic forces and the ideologies that seek to
rationalize and legitimize them are products of the crisis and fragmentation
that the soft managerial regime has experienced in the last two decades.
While the new entrepreneurialism represents an at least potentially anti-
managerial tendency, however, neither its economic effects nor the values
and ideas associated with it constitute a serious challenge to the regime.
Aside from  its  invocations of  certain bourgeois  ideological  and  moral
fragments, the premises of its ideology are compatible with or are actually
indistinguishable from  those  of  the  soft  regime and  its  worldview.
Entrepreneurialism offers no enduring alternative to mass organization or
the  application of  managerial and  technical skills  to  economic, social,
political, and cultural relationships, and its technological innovations are
likely to reinforce managerial dominance rather than diminish it. Despite its
origins outside the apparatus of the regime and its hostility to some aspects
of   managerial   dominance, the   anti-managerial tendencies of
entrepreneurialism appear to represent persistent and historically moribund
bourgeois  elements rather than  the  emergence of  a  significant new
alternative social force around which opposition to the soft regime might
gather.
## The Managerial Class
The power elite, pluralist, and entrepreneurialist criticisms of the theory

of the managerial revolution are inadequate refutations of the theory. While
James Burnham’s original formulation erred in some respects or failed to
anticipate future developments in the economy, the political order, and the
culture and society of the post-World War II United States, Burnham was
correct in his general prediction that the bourgeois order and its elite were
in eclipse and that a managerial elite, with its own interests and ideology
antagonistic to  those  of  the  bourgeoisie, was  emerging.  Relying  on  the
managerial and technical skills necessary to operate mass organizations, the
new elite has consolidated its functional control of such organizations in the
state,  economy,  and  culture. It  has  integrated these  organizations into  a
regime or  apparatus of  dominance and  has  rationalized its  dominance
through the  formulation and  dissemination of  a  managerial ideology.  It
exhibits the two characteristics of an elite, similar behavior with regard to a
set of shared interests and the ability to make these interests prevail over
those of other groups.
Yet  despite  the  unity  and  dominance of  the  managerial elite  in  the
United States, its power is not absolute. Even after the consolidation of
managerial dominance, bourgeois forces retained a significant amount of
political, economic, and  social  power.  Bourgeois  political movements,
closely attached to entrepreneurial economic bases, have resisted the fusion
of state and economy and the social engineering programs of the managerial
elite; and the persistence of bourgeois ideologies among large parts of the
population has  provided an  audience and  a  political base  for  such
movements.
Nevertheless, the bourgeois elite and the bourgeois class in general have
been permanently crippled by the rise of its managerial rival. The pinnacle
of the bourgeois order, the grande bourgeoisie, has become dependent on

and  subordinate  to  the  managerial  elite  and  can  no  longer  act  as  the
principal defender of the bourgeois order. Neither the grande bourgeoisie
nor the upper middle class of the bourgeois order, the high bourgeoisie, is
able to control the mass organizations and assert the power that their control
yields. They are unable to do so because they lack the managerial skills that
are necessary for control, and when they seek to acquire such skills, the
result is a process of assimilation within the managerial regime that further
weakens the bourgeois elite through a kind of “brain drain” by which the
acquisition of managerial skills serves to assimilate the most able bourgeois
elements into the managerial regime and to impart to them a new set of
interests and a new group perspective that alienates such elements from
their class and social order. Attracted by the very considerable material and
psychic rewards of  the  managerial regime, such  bourgeois  elements are
transformed into managers.
In the vacuum of leadership that resulted from the decapitation of the
bourgeois order, the leadership of bourgeois forces devolved upon a sub-
elite that lacked the vast wealth, high prestige, and cultural sophistication of
the grande bourgeoisie  but  retained control of  significant economic
resources, substantial political influence at  state  and  local  levels  and  in
many  congressional districts, and  a  degree of  cultural power  through
bourgeois organs of public opinion, churches, and educational institutions.
The power retained by the high and petty bourgeoisie, however, while often
sufficient to resist and check the dynamic of the managerial regime, was
unable to occupy the key positions in the managerial regime, dislodge its
elite, dismantle its apparatus, or alter its agenda. The managerial regime has
principally been  concentrated in  the  heavily populated, urbanized, and
industrialized regions of  the  United States, the  Northeast and  Atlantic
regions, where the revolution of mass and scale exerted its greatest impact.

## [149]
The resources and skills of these regions in wealth, political influence,
technology,  and  intellectual and  communicational assets, as  well  as  the
structural advantages of centralized mass organizations in acquiring and
establishing power, provide the managerial forces with sufficient power to
establish and  perpetuate their  dominance. The  power of  the  bourgeois
forces is thus largely confined to resisting, reacting to, or slowing down the
implementation of the managerial imperatives.
The persistence of bourgeois power outside the geographical core of the
managerial regime,  then,  does  not  effectively challenge or  diminish the
power of the managerial elite, and given the unity and dominance of the
elite and the evolution of its cultural as well as its economic and political
hegemony, it is reasonable to ask whether the managers constitute a class.
James Burnham and  Alfred D.   Chandler,  Jr.  speak of  the  corporate
managers as a “new class,”
## [150]
and Irving Kristol, among others, has used
the term “New Class” to describe
the people whom liberal capitalism had sent to college in order to help manage its affluent,
highly technological, mildly paternalistic, “postindustrial” society. . . . This “new class”
consists of  scientists,  lawyers, city  planners,  social  workers, educators, criminologists,
sociologists, public health doctors, and so forth—a substantial number of whom find their
careers in the expanding public sector rather than the private.
## [151]
The  professionals that  Kristol  enumerates are  clearly part  of  the
managerial elite, but—perhaps because he shares Daniel Bell’s view that
there is little unity between corporate managers and those of the state—he
does not include the managers of the mass corporation in the New Class
category.
Bell  himself has  challenged the  usefulness of  the  term  “class”  to
describe the managers, bureaucrats, and technically skilled personnel of the
mass organizations on the ground that these groups do not share sufficient

unity of interests and ideology to merit the term. Yet, in Bell’s definition of
class—“a ‘class’  exists  when  there  is  a  community and  continuity of
institutional interest and an ideology that provides symbols of recognition
(or  codes  of  behavior) for  its  members”
## [152]
—the  managerial elite  does
constitute at  least  a  rudimentary social  class,  since  its  members share
common interests,  behave similarly in  regard to  them, and  identify,
rationalize, and  communicate their  interests by  means of  a  common
ideology. It is true that managers are often distracted from the pursuit of
their group interests and that they often disagree on how they should be
pursued—characteristics they share with almost all elites—and it is also
true that their ideology is not a highly formalized or rigorous set of beliefs.
It is probable that the persistent and restraining power of the bourgeois
forces and  ideologies and  their  influence on  and  penetration of  some
elements of the managerial elite itself have served to retard the development
of the managers as a class. It is also probable, however, that the continuing
decline of the bourgeoisie and its power and its inability to reverse the
course of the managerial regime will eventually remove this constraint on
the managers. If so, they will then develop a more explicit and overt class
consciousness and identity, which will be expressed in a more sophisticated
and formalized managerial ideology.
The  managerial  elite  is  thus  generally unified in  the  sense  that  its
members generally behave similarly in regard to their group interests, and it
is also generally dominant over the bourgeois elite in the sense of being
able to make its interests prevail over those of non-managerial groups or to
make the interests of such groups dependent upon its own interests. Yet the
presupposition of the unity and dominance of an elite is that it be able to
identify and communicate its interests. Elites generally do this by means of
their ideologies, which serve to communicate and legitimize the interests of

the elite in a disguised or coded form. The managerial ideology and its
component ideas and values are no exception, and the understanding of the
dynamics and prospects of the managerial regime is not complete without a
more  detailed  analysis of  this  ideology,  its  content, and  the  social  and
political functions it performs.

## THE IDEOLOGY OF THE
## MANAGERIAL ELITE
Elites and Ideology
“Ruling classes,” wrote  Gaetano Mosca, who,  with  Vilfredo Pareto,
developed the theory of elites in the late 19th century,
do not justify their power exclusively by de facto possession of it, but try to find a moral
and legal basis for it, representing it as the logical and necessary consequence of doctrines
and beliefs that are generally recognized and accepted. . . . This legal and moral basis, or
principle, on which the power of the political class rests, is . . . the “political formula.”
## [153]
What Mosca called “political formulas” are largely identical to what
today are called ideologies, doctrines the purpose of which is not to offer
true scientific or philosophical explanations of reality but rather to justify a
course of action for a particular group—a political party, a religious sect, a
nation, or a ruling elite.
Ideologies, however, generally claim to be philosophical or scientific in
nature and to provide true explanations of reality, while, at the same time,
they  offer  justifications or  rationalizations for  courses of  action and
behavior that accrue to the advantage of the group that has adopted them.
There is therefore a sense in which ideologies are always fraudulent or
deceptive, for their real purpose is to benefit the group that adheres to them;
and  the  explanation of  reality that  they  claim  to  offer  is  one  that  is
calculated to promote the interests of the group. “And yet,” writes Mosca,
“that  does  not  mean  that  political  formulas are  mere  quackeries aptly

invented to trick the masses into obedience.”
The truth is that they answer a real need in man’s social nature; and this
need, so universally felt, of governing and knowing that one is governed not
on the basis of mere material or intellectual force, but on the basis of a
moral principle, has beyond any doubt a practical and a real importance.
## [154]
Elites, in  other  words, do  not  simply make  up  their  ideologies  or
formulas out of whole cloth. The members of elites (excluding cynics and
dissidents) generally  believe in  their  own  ideologies and  try  to  behave
consistently with their implications, and the intellectual foundations of an
ideology, whether scientific, religious, ethical, or philosophical in character,
must  be  both  reasonably sophisticated in  argumentation and  reasonably
honest and complete in the selection of evidence. An ideology fails if its
ostensible purpose of explaining reality becomes transparently deceptive
and the real purpose is exposed, so that if it is not to fail, it must preserve
the ostensible purpose by its credibility and intellectual sophistication in
order to appeal to persons outside the elite who have no special interests
served by it.
The ideology of an elite must in general perform three functions: (1) it
must rationalize the interests of the elite in the sense of legitimizing or
justifying them in terms of some larger or higher good than those interests
themselves. Elites,  in  other  words, do  not  usually claim, publicly or
privately, that they are acting in a particular way because such action is in
their group interest. They claim rather that their action is in accordance with
the will of God, the principles of morality, the laws of nature, the national
interest, the destiny of a race, the inevitable course of history, the will or
good of the people or of mankind, or is a step toward some widely approved
value such as peace, liberty, justice, prosperity, or stability.

(2) An ideology must identify and communicate the interests of an elite
to  the  members of  the  elite  itself  as  well  as  to  those  outside  it.  The
identification and communication of elite interests take place within the
terms of the ideology  and  not  outside  these  terms. The  ideology of  the
landed elite of 17th-century England, for example, did not baldly assert that
Crown and  Parliament must  protect the  rights  and  privileges of  landed
property because it was in the material interests of the landed elite to do so.
Rather it  presented a  set  of  formal arguments, drawn from  religious,
historical, legal, and philosophical sources, that the power and privilege
attached to landed property were morally right and socially necessary. It is
unlikely that very many members of the landed elite doubted the truth of
this ideology, and it was certainly unusual for them to express such doubts
in public. The terms or formal arguments of the ideological justification of
landed property served to identify to the elite what its interests were and to
communicate to its members how to defend and pursue these interests. The
formal arguments did so, not baldly or overtly, but in a disguised or “coded”
way that satisfied both the elite and those classes outside and subordinate to
it that power was institutionalized in a just form that served the interests and
rights of everyone.
(3) An ideology must serve to integrate a society, to provide a common
frame  of  reference to  which all  parties in  a  dispute can  appeal and  a
common ground of action to which all members of a society can rally. On a
popular level such integration is achieved in part by symbols such as the
King  or  Queen in  Great  Britain;  the  Constitution, the  Flag,  or  the
“American Way” in the United States; the teachings of Marx and Lenin in
the Soviet Union; or, in religiously unified societies, the tenets and symbols
of the public faith. Thus, the ideology of an elite must be credible to the
members of society outside the elite. Only by the ideological integration of

the  population at  large  can  the  elite  obtain more  or  less  spontaneous
obedience and  deference from  it.  An  ideology performs its  integrative
function successfully if the general population acknowledges the legitimacy
and  efficacy of  the  power of  the  elite.  An  ideology that  successfully
integrates a society is often called a “public orthodoxy,” and dissent from it
or attacks on it are frequently subject to serious sanctions.
It  must  not  be  thought, however,  that  ideologies are  generated
spontaneously or  that  they  are  willingly accepted by  the  non-elite. The
history of most of the ideologies that have served the interests of elites
shows that they are often imposed and maintained by force or fraud and that
rival ideologies or even significant deviations from the orthodox ideology
are quite ruthlessly suppressed. An ideology often builds upon elements of
belief that were generally accepted prior to the rise of the elite that espouses
it  (and  often  such  elements are  themselves the  remnants of  the  older
ideologies of earlier elites), but these elements, when they are useful to a
new  dominant minority or  cannot conveniently be  ignored or  entirely
suppressed, are re-interpreted or adapted to fit the new ideology that the
new  elite  formulates and  imposes. The  process of  imposition varies,
depending on the apparatus of power and resources available to the elite,
but common instruments of ideological imposition in history, in addition to
the more coercive sanctions of secret police, informers, state censors, and
inquisitors, have been churches, schools, art and literature, and the press
and other media of mass communication, all of which may possess official
or semi-official ties to and privileges from the regime of the elite.
Nor must it be thought that the intellectuals who formulate the ideology
of an elite do so insincerely or with intellectual dishonesty. Intellectuals
tend  to  take  ideas  more  seriously  than  most  people and  certainly  more

seriously than most of the pragmatic leaders of an elite. In any society,
different individuals, sects, and schools of thought formulate a variety of
ideas. Some of these ideas are more or less consistent with the perceived
interests of an elite, which tends to sponsor or promote them and those who
have formulated them; other ideas are not useful to its perceived interests or
appear to represent a threat to its interests, and the elite tends to ignore or
suppress them  and  their  sources. This  process of  selection leads  to  the
evolution of an ideology, more or less formal in content, that performs the
functions of  rationalization, communication, and  integration that  any
successful ideology must serve. The intellectuals who originally formulated
the elements of the ideology and even those who develop the elements into
a  formal  doctrine presumably do  so  because they  genuinely believe its
content, as do those members of the elite who sponsor and promote them
and regard the ideology as a serious explanation of reality as well as a
convenient justification of their dominance. Indeed, intellectual and literary
history furnishes many instances of significant works of thought and art that
have performed ideological functions for various elites and political forces.
The theological and political theories of Thomas Aquinas and William of
Ockham were so used by rival political groups (the Papacy and the Holy
Roman Emperor) in the late Middle Ages. Similarly, the autocratic regime
of Augustus Caesar in first century Rome used the poetry of Vergil and
Horace  and  the  historiography of Livy  for  political  and  propaganda
purposes, and much of the political content of Shakespeare’s plays served
the same function under the Tudor monarchy.
## [155]
To point to the political
uses  of  art,  literature, scholarship,  and  even  theology,  philosophy,  and
science in  no  way  detracts from  the  motivations, characters, or
achievements of those who created such works. At the same time, it is not
unusual for persons of considerable intellectual stature to attach themselves

and their ideas to a rising or dominant political force, to suppress evidence
and arguments that question their ideas, and even to join in the professional
or political suppression of their intellectual rivals. Despite the occurrence of
such  behavior,  there  is  no  reason to  attribute such  ambitions  to  or  to
question the  motives or  intellectual honesty of  the  general run  of
intellectuals who formulate the ideology of an elite.
Despite genuine efforts by the members of an elite to adhere consistently
to their ideology, their overriding need with respect to it is the ability of the
ideology to reflect and rationalize their interests. When the elite finds itself
in  circumstances in  which the  ideology does  not  serve  its  needs  and
interests, it may alter the ideology or it may simply ignore it. The elite will
therefore occasionally violate its  professed ideology,  and  it  will  seldom
display much attraction for a highly formalized set of ideas that cannot be
applied to changing circumstances and interests. The ideologies that serve
the interests of elites therefore often tend to be rather vague and to cover
their  evasion of  philosophical and  scientific problems with  rhetoric or
specious logic, although such ideologies may draw on systems of ideas that
are far more rigorous and serious in their effort to correspond to reality. It is
therefore often impossible to describe the ideology of an elite in a logically
rigorous way. Most elites simply do not confine themselves to beliefs that
are  too  rigorous and  systematic,  and  accounts of  an  ideology must
frequently describe its formal content and logical structure without a great
deal of precision rather than in the carefully defined and precise terms of
philosophy and science.
The managerial elite in the mass organizations of state, economy, and
culture of 20th-century society, like any other elite, possesses an ideology,
which it uses to rationalize, identify, and communicate its interests and to

integrate mass society under its power. In the managerial regimes of the
Western world, in which mass consumption and mass political participation
have  developed,  the  dominant ideology of  the  managerial elite  may  in
general be called “managerial humanism,” though it is known under various
labels in the different developed states of the West. Managerial humanism is
not usually a systematically articulated or formally explicit set of ideas, and
it often exists in the minds of the managerial elites and their mass following
as an unrecognized or unarticulated assumption or set of assumptions that is
regarded as axiomatic by its adherents. Explicit challenges to or dissension
from  the  ideas  of  managerial humanism will  therefore often  encounter
moral or emotional outrage, the expression of doubts about the intelligence,
good will, or sanity of those who challenge them, or simple perplexity. In
its looseness, informality, and lack of system, managerial humanism lends
itself to adaptations to the practical needs and interests of the managerial
elite, and in its axiomatic and unspoken character and the reactions that
challenges to it frequently meet, it resembles the ideologies of elites of the
past  and  provides a  useful service  to  the  managerial elite  by  becoming
virtually impervious to intellectual or verbal refutation.
As a doctrine, a formal system of ideas, managerial humanism may be
defined as the belief that all men can (or should or will) be governed in their
social, economic, and political relationships by the science of management,
the  science of  operating and  directing mass  organizations. Since
management is a system of knowledge and skills that is applicable only to
mass organizations, managerial humanism implies that all human beings
should (can,  will)  live  and  exist  within the  framework  of  mass
organizations. The  specific predicate of  managerial humanism—why
human beings should be organized within mass structures and their lives
and  relationships governed by  management—varies with  the  particular

versions that prevail with different countries, cultures, political parties, or
individual spokesmen. In  some  versions, the  re-organization of  human
affairs into mass structures and managerial government (design or planning)
of  human relationships is  predicated as  historically inevitable or
predetermined, the result of human progress and the forces that motivate
progress. Alternative forms of  social organization are  regarded by  the
exponents of  this  version of  managerial humanism as  irrelevant or
impractical, regardless of their claims to desirability or inherent superiority.
In other versions, mass organizations and managerial direction of human
affairs are advocated as desirable or superior in themselves in that they are
capable of significantly or completely ameliorating the human condition in
ways that other forms of social organization have failed or are unable to do.
Still  other  versions make  no  predictions of  inevitability and  do  not
explicitly advocate the superiority of management and mass organization
but merely put forward “value free” descriptions of what the uses of mass
organization and  management might be.  Finally,  there  is  a  version of
managerial humanism that, though it does not predict the inevitability of the
dominance of mass organization and managerial control, in fact leaves little
real  choice  between them  and  alternative forms  of  social  and  political
organization, since  it  predicts imminent disaster and  catastrophe for
mankind unless mass organization and managerial control are adopted. In
practice, however,  all  of  these  predicates and  different versions of
managerial humanism are  conjoined in  the  popular and  common
expressions of  the  ideology,  so  that  mass  organizations and  managerial
control are  at  once  inevitable, morally and  socially desirable, merely
possible, and  necessary to  avoid  disaster.  The  particular predicate (or
combination of predicates) that is emphasized in any given circumstance
will depend upon the intellectual sophistication of the spokesman and on

the  appeal  of  certain kinds  of  arguments and  predicates to  particular
audiences.
Managerial humanism serves the interests and needs of the managerial
elite in two general ways. First, it legitimizes the existence, dominance, and
continuing expansion in size and scale of the mass organizations in the
state, economy, and culture and their operation and control by specially
trained managerial elites. Secondly, it incorporates, in a logically coherent
and credible framework, the elemental ideologies of managerial society—
scientism, utopianism, hedonism, and cosmopolitanism—which the
managerial elites in the developed states of the West need to rationalize
their power and construct their regime. Managerial humanism incorporates
scientism because the premise on which management is based is that human
beings and their social relationships are analogous to the phenomena of
inert nature and can be manipulated by scientific techniques in the same
way.  It  is  utopian  or  melioristic because it  claims that  a  significant or
complete amelioration of the human condition is possible by means of the
application of the science of management (as well as other sciences) to
human affairs. It is hedonistic because it rejects the work ethic and ideals of
the  socialized individualism of  the bourgeois  order,  and  its  view  of
amelioration and of the utopia that can or will come into being is based on
the gratification of material appetites and the avoidance of deferral and
sacrifice. The scientism of managerial humanism denies or tends not to
recognize non-material motivations and needs of human beings or interprets
such  needs  as  ultimately materialistic in  nature. Managerial humanism,
finally, is cosmopolitan because it encompasses an abstract view of man
that tends to ignore or reject the particularities of his historical and social
existence (especially the  differentiated groups, classes, and local
communities of the bourgeois order) and emphasizes what is common to all

men  at  all  times  and  in  all  places and  circumstances. The  global or
transnational organization of mankind under the discipline and ideologies of
managerialism and  human liberation from  or  transcendence of  national,
parochial, social  and  economic, racial, and  sectarian categories are  the
highest goals of  managerial humanism, and  it  is  because of  the
cosmopolitan and universalist premises of the ideology that its description
as  “humanism” is  appropriate. Managerial humanism thus  combines the
four elemental ideologies of managerial society in a reasonably coherent
form  that  can  be  invested with  more  rigorous empirical and  logical
justification and with more emotional and moral appeal as circumstances
and  the  interests of  the  managerial  elite  demand, although the  logical
relationship of these elements and the inferences that are drawn from them
are not the only possible coherent forms they can take.
Managerial humanism is  not  the  only  ideology that  predominates in
managerial societies, however.  In  the  course of  the  20th  century,  two
general types  of  managerial regime have  evolved in  response to  the
revolution of mass and scale. One type, which has prevailed in the Soviet
Union and, until recently, in Eastern Europe and to some extent in other
communist states and  which prevailed in Germany under National
Socialism and to some extent in the fascist states of the 1930s and 1940s,
may be called the “hard” managerial regime. Its elites tend to rely on force,
often to an extreme degree, as a means of acquiring and using power, and
the ideologies that are prevalent in these regimes tend to reject hedonism
and cosmopolitanism and to emphasize ascetic and particularistic themes
and values—the necessity or desirability of hard work, postponement of
gratification, the acceptance of authority, the endurance of suffering and
pain, and subordination and loyalty to and sacrifice for the group, nation,
race, party, or class. The second type of managerial regime, which prevails

in the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and the developed states of the
West, may be called the “soft” type. The elites of the soft managerial regime
tend to rely on manipulation and inducement rather than on force to acquire
and make use of power, and the ideologies that prevail tend to emphasize
hedonistic and  cosmopolitan themes and  values—self-fulfillment,
immediate gratification, the avoidance of pain and suffering, the pursuit of
pleasure, disregard for or independence from group loyalties and identities,
and the affirmation of internationalist, egalitarian, universalist, ecumenical,
and syncretistic ideals.
The differences between these two types of managerial society are due
largely to differences in the composition and character of their elites and in
the way in which these elites emerged under the impact of the revolution of
mass  and  scale.  Regardless of  their  many  and  important differences,
however, the hard and soft types are both managerial regimes in that they
both exhibit the same reliance on mass organizations in state, economy, and
culture. In both types of regime, specially trained managerial elites use their
skills  to  operate and  control mass  organizations and  to  dominate mass
society; and both types exhibit the same hostility to the prescriptive and
bourgeois orders and their elites, although this hostility is manifested in
significantly different ways.
The ideologies of the hard managerial regimes, however, are not part of
or consistent with managerial humanism. Although National Socialism and
Marxism-Leninism,  the  principal  ideologies of  the  hard  managerial
regimes, retain the  scientistic  and  utopian elements of  managerial
humanism, they  reject  the  hedonistic and  cosmopolitan elements that
prevail in the soft regimes of the West. The formal content, values, and
logical development of the ideologies of the hard managerial regimes are

thus quite different from those of managerial humanism and its variations.
These differences too reflect differences in the composition and characters
of  the  elites  and  in  the  structures  and  functioning of  the  two  types  of
managerial regime.
## [156]
In the United States the specific and most common form that managerial
humanism takes has come to be called “liberalism,” although virtually the
same ideology, known by other labels in the other developed countries,
prevails throughout the other soft managerial regimes. There are, of course,
differences among these  national or  regional variations of  managerial
humanism, but there are also certain unifying beliefs that they all share and
a common function that they all perform—the rationalization of the power
and interests of the managerial elites in the states in which these ideologies
prevail.

Liberalism as the Ideology of the
## Managerial Elite
The  history of  the  political movements and  ideas  generally called
“liberalism” in late 19th and 20th-century America is associated (at least by
its  exponents and  defenders) with  political enfranchisement, social  and
economic reform, the extension of civil liberties, and compassion for the
oppressed and  disadvantaged. It  may  therefore appear incongruous to
identify liberalism as the ideology of an elite and a means of rationalizing
group interests. Yet,  whatever the  motivations and  intentions  of  the
exponents of liberalism, the effect of the popularization of liberal ideas and
values has  been  to  reinforce the  structures and  functioning of  the
managerial regime by disseminating ideas that justify the growth of mass
organizations in state, economy, and culture and the integration or fusion of
these organizations. In doing so, liberalism has provided a rationalization
for  the  power of  the  managerial  elites  that  dominate in  these  mass
structures. Although liberalism has offered criticisms of the structures and
functioning of the managerial regime, managerial elites have been able to
adapt  its  ideas  to  their  own  needs  and  interests. In  the  20th  century,
American liberalism has  been  the  predominant form  of  managerial
humanism in the United States and as such has served as the principal
ideology of the managerial elite as a whole, performing the functions that
elite ideologies or “political formulas” usually perform.
Liberalism has reinforced the managerial regime in the United States in
two general ways. First, the formal content of liberal ideas since the early
20th  century has  provided a  coherent rationalization of  the  ideological

formulas of meliorism and  utopianism, scientism, hedonism, and
cosmopolitanism that  reflect the  functional imperatives of  mass
organizations. Secondly,  liberalism as  a  practical political and  social
movement has  justified the  structural elaboration and  integration  of  the
managerial regime in all respects. Legislation and policies associated with
and implemented by liberal forces have promoted the fusion of state and
economy, the growth of managerial bureaucracy in state and corporation,
the rise of managerial Caesarism in the form of an “imperial Presidency,”
the  centralization of  government  and  the  diminution of  state  and  local
authority, the homogenization of society, the diffusion of mass education,
the secularization of religion, and other aspects of the managerial regime. It
may be argued that such trends are inevitable in any mass society and that
liberalism is  not  responsible for  them. It  is  true  that  the  trend  of
organizational enlargement in mass society and the political, economic, and
cultural changes that accompany it appear to be inevitable or at least logical
and highly probable. The importance of liberalism and other managerial
ideologies lies not in their causal relationship with these trends but in their
support and acceptance of them, in efforts to find rationalizations for them
and the interests of those social groups that gain power and social rewards
from  such  trends, in  the  consistent encouragement of  these  trends that
liberalism offers,  and  their  equally consistent discouragement of  and
opposition to any trends or movements away from them.
Liberalism did not, of course, originate with the managerial groups and
interests of the 20th century but developed as a formal body of thought in
the  Enlightenment of  the  18th  century.  Although there  is  considerable
continuity between the liberalism of the philosophes and that of the 20th
century, the principal characteristic of liberal thought at the end of the 18th
century and  throughout most  of  the  19th  century was  its  emphasis on

individualism—on the individual as a citizen, as an economic actor, and as
a moral agent—and this classical liberalism, reflected in the theories of the
classical economists, of Herbert Spencer and the “Social Darwinists,” and
of John Stuart Mill and Thomas Jefferson, among others, served as the
ideological basis  of  the bourgeois  order  and  functioned as  the  principal
political formula of the bourgeois elite. As the bourgeoisie solidified its
power in the course of the 19th century, individualistic classical liberalism
served to rationalize and protect the interests and values of the bourgeois
elite and became a socially conservative force. It abandoned or muted many
of the reformist and indeed revolutionary impulses that had animated liberal
thought in  the  previous century  and  was  transformed into  a  body  of
doctrines that resisted reforms that went beyond or threatened the interests
of the elites of the age. A similar process by which managerial ideologies
were  transformed into  essentially protective and  conservative doctrines
occurred in the 20th century as the managerial elites overcame bourgeois
opposition and solidified their own power.
At  the  end  of  the  19th  century,  liberalism underwent a  dramatic
reformulation, carried out in England by T.H.   Green, J.A.  Hobson, Leonard
Hobhouse and various socialist thinkers and in the United States by the
writers and activists associated with the “Progressive movement.” The “new
liberalism” of the late 19th century was in many respects a direct response
to the impact of the revolution of mass and scale on the political, economic,
and social life of the industrialized societies and represented an effort to
discipline and  reform the  breakdowns that  the  revolution caused. The
reformulation of  liberalism consisted primarily in  a  retreat  from  or
abandonment of  the  individualism  that  characterized bourgeois  liberal
ideology and a new emphasis on the social and collective nature and duties
of human beings. The new liberalism, in fact if not always in formal theory,

tended to see the individual not as the basic moral agent and unit of society
but  as  a  product  of  the  social  environment.  Neo-liberal  theorists in  the
idealist tradition such as Green in England and Josiah Royce in the United
States “developed and made coherent the criticism of individualism that
began with Rousseau’s theory of the general will,” and the purpose of their
theory “was to show that personality is ‘realized’ by finding a significant
part to play in the life of society.”
## [157]
Since society and its political organ,
the state, are in this view prior to the individual, this reformulated version
of liberal thought rejected the classical liberal view that restrictions on the
activities and functions of the state liberated and assisted the individual.
Green’s liberalism . . . was a frank acceptance of the state as a positive
agency to  be  used  at  any  point  where legislation could  be  shown to
contribute to “positive freedom,” in short for any purpose that added to the
general welfare without creating worse evils than it removed.
## [158]
The state was itself part of the social environment that, with economic
and  social  institutions, contributed,  for  good  or  ill,  to  the  formation of
human beings. The new liberalism therefore legitimized a more active role
for  the  state  in  contributing to  social progress and  in  carrying out
interventions in social and economic processes that would alter or control
the  environment. American Progressivist thought, writes historian  Frank
Tariello, Jr., held that “because the polity had to respond docilely to the
social will, there could be no other conceivable limitation on the power of
the government than the needs of society.”
The  dependence  of  the  political upon  the  social, then,  made  it
impossible to posit the existence of two autonomous spheres functioning
independently of  each  other.  Through the  grace  of  the  social interest,
government, no longer bound by a written constitution of its powers, was

free  to  act  as  it  wished, taking on  any  function that  might  be  deemed
socially expedient.
## [159]
It is a characteristic of all liberalism—whether of the Enlightenment, of
the 19th-century bourgeoisie, or of the 20th century—that it harbors an
essentially optimistic view of human nature and the human condition. In
classical liberalism this optimism is reflected in the liberal belief that the
“enlightened self-interest” of  the  individual, emancipated  from  the
prejudices, ignorance, and  restraints of  traditional society,  will  lead  to
progress and even to the perfection of the human condition, and bourgeois
thinkers such as Herbert Spencer popularized this optimism in the 19th
century.  Optimism is  no  less  characteristic of  20th-century liberalism,
however.  As  historian George  E.   Mowry  wrote  of  the  intellectual
atmosphere of the American Progressive movement,
Central to this new intellectual formulation was the firm belief that to a
considerable degree man could make and remake his own world. . . . Both
the rising social sciences and the new social gospel promised that basically
men  were  more  alike  than  different and  that  they  were  not  evil  by
inheritance, but, if anything, were inclined by their own nature to be good. .
. . [T]he great inequalities existing among them at the moment were not
natural, and from the viewpoint of social peace and human welfare were
decidedly bad.
## [160]
The optimistic view of human nature that characterizes liberal doctrine
contains important  implications for  the  functioning of  liberalism as  the
ideology of the managerial elite. Liberal optimism implies that the evils of
the human condition are not grounded in men’s nature but derive from their
social, economic,  and  political environment. Hence, these  evils  are  not
necessary or inevitable but can be removed or alleviated by changing the

environment. If such evils can be removed, then the abolition or significant
reduction of war, crime, poverty, inequality, corruption, disease, hunger, and
ignorance is  practicable. The  optimistic view  of  the  human  condition
expressed in liberal thought is thus grounded in an environmentalism that is
itself the theoretical foundation of liberal meliorism and utopianism. The
late  19th-century social reformer Henry George,  whose Progress and
Poverty (1879) helped popularize environmentalist theories in the United
States, applied the theory specifically to differences between Jews and other
groups of human beings. As Eric F.  Goldman writes, describing George’s
view,
Environment, an environment that had been made by human beings and
could be changed by human beings, determined the characteristics of Jews,
as it determined all men, institutions, and ideas. . . . Legislating a better
environment, particularly a better economic environment, could bring about
a better world, and bring it about before unconscionable centuries.
## [161]
Environmentalism and  its  melioristic or  utopian implications were
present in classical liberalism also, although they were considerably diluted
as  the  bourgeoisie  entrenched itself  in  power.  In  the  earlier versions of
classical liberal thought, however, it was the individual who was the source
of  social amelioration and  perfection. The  “environment” in  classical
liberalism consisted principally of those restraints that inhibited individual
achievements, especially the  coercive restraints of  the  state  and  other
legally privileged  structures such  as  established churches, hereditary
dynasties and aristocracies, and guilds. Once these restraints were removed
—as they were by the liberal, nationalist, and secularist revolutions and
reforms of the 19th century—individual efforts would, through the pursuit
of  self-interest, eventually perfect or  significantly ameliorate the  human

condition. By the end of the 19th century, however, it had become clear to
many that individualism had not generated any such utopian amelioration
and that the congestion, corruption, and incipient collapse instigated by the
revolution of  mass  and  scale  were  complicating and  preventing the
realization of human perfectibility. At the same time, revisions in science,
as well as in theology, philosophy, and social thought, suggested that the
reform of the environment and the perfection of man were more challenging
but  no  less  practicable processes than  individualistic liberalism had
recognized.
The new liberalism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries also relied
upon  science, especially social science, to  understand and  change the
environment. “Science,” write Arthur S. Link and Richard L. McCormick,
“also  had  a  pervasive impact on  the  methods and  objectives of
progressivism.”
Many leading reformers were  specialists in  the  new  disciplines of
statistics, economics, sociology,  and  psychology.  These new  social
scientists set out to gather data on human behavior as it actually was and to
discover the  laws  which governed it.  Since  social scientists accepted
environmentalist and interventionist assumptions implicitly, they believed
that knowledge of natural laws would make it possible to devise and apply
solutions to  improve the  human  condition. This  faith  underpinned the
methods used by almost all reformers of the time: investigation of the facts
and application of social-science knowledge to their analysis; entrusting
trained experts to  decide what  should be  done;  and,  finally,  mandating
government to execute reform.
## [162]
Economics, political  science, sociology,  and  anthropology were  all
disciplines closely associated in  their  professional and  academic origins

with an optimistic and environmentalist view of man and with the political
movement and  ideology of  liberalism. The  science on  which such
movements rested differed considerably from that of the bourgeois era. The
latter  emphasized  a  “closed universe” in  which Euclidean geometry,  a
Newtonian physics, a Darwinian biology, and a sensationalist psychology
described universal and invariable scientific laws by which both material
objects and human beings operated. In regarding human beings as natural
phenomena, 19th-century science  was  indeed scientistic, but  it  was  a
scientism that for the most part was not utopian because its view of nature
in the form of invariable law prescribed very clear limits to what human
beings could be and achieve. Evolutionary and positivist thinkers of the
19th century did entertain the eventual possibility of a utopian society, but
they generally placed it so far in the future or so circumscribed the means
by  which  it  could  be  realized as  to  render it  irrelevant to  immediate
concerns. “[Herbert] Spencer,”  writes Sir  Ernest Barker,  “tantalizes the
individual with glimpses of jewels of freedom, which he can only wear in
the days of perfection.”
## [163]
The new science, influenced by the theory of probability, challenges to
Newtonian cosmology,  a  “Reform Darwinism,” and  an  irrationalist
psychology, rejected the determinate nature of the universe and elaborated a
view  of  nature that  allowed for  much more immediate human
reconstruction of society, of man, and of nature itself. Walter Lippmann, a
popularizing exponent of  this  new  world  view,  emphasized the  role  of
modern science in reforming the social environment in his book of 1914,
Drift and  Mastery, and this belief became a basic assumption of the new
liberalism.
A belief in an open universe in which man was neither chained to the

past nor riding on an automatic escalator into the future was central to the
creed. Also at its heart was a belief in the doctrine of possible progress
based upon the twin assumptions that man was more good than he was evil
and that he had the power through his intellect and moral sense to change
his environment.
## [164]
The reformulated liberalism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
through its optimistic view of man and its environmentalist view that social
evils could be removed by the application of scientific technique to society,
allowed for  and  indeed implied  the  scientism and  utopianism that  are
essential for  the  rationalization of  the  managerial regime. The
environmentalist premises of  the  new  liberalism were  evident in  the
economic thought of  the  critics of  classical economics, in  the  liberal
critiques of racial, sexual, and class discrimination, and in the criminology
and  juristic thought of  liberalism.  Roscoe Pound  and  Louis  Brandeis
incorporated environmentalist theory into  their  school of  “sociological
jurisprudence”  in  the  early  20th  century,  and  environmentalism also
informed the Social Gospel movement and the secularization of religious
concerns in the Progressive era. To be sure, the new liberalism was not
always a  rigorous or  coherent  set  of  ideas; not  all  of  its  exponents
perceived, understood, or accepted all its tenets or their implications, and
within the body of liberal thought there were tensions, qualifications, and
emphases that often tended to dilute or deflect the force of its principal
assertions. Yet it was precisely the vagueness of liberalism, coupled with its
claim  to  moral  intensity and  intellectual sophistication, that  gave  it  the
appeal it has historically exerted and allowed it to function as the ideology
of the rising managerial elite.
The environmentalism of liberal theory also justified the hedonism and

cosmopolitanism that  characterize managerial humanism  and  reflect the
functioning of  the  soft  managerial  regime. The  environment  that  20th-
century liberals perceived as the source of social evil was precisely the
bourgeois  regime itself  and  its  institutions and  values. A  fundamental
element in the ideology and set of values of the bourgeois regime was the
ethic by which the virtues of work, thrift, duty, and deferral of gratification
were  inculcated and  upheld. This  ethic,  institutionalized in  bourgeois
economic and social codes of socially rooted or ascetic individualism, was
perceived by many Progressivist liberals as responsible for a callous and
brutalizing society  that  ignored or  exploited human needs and  was
indifferent or hostile to the possibilities of social reform and the merits of
the intellectually and morally deserving. Liberal criticism and rejection of
the  bourgeois  ethic  and  its  institutionalization in  the  social  and  cultural
environment as “philistinism” was closely related to the rationalization and
popularization of  its  antithesis, the  articulation of  a  moral  and  cultural
relativism that implied a rejection of all standards by which moral, social,
political, and economic behavior could be evaluated and which allowed for
the development of a hedonistic ethic. Although liberal theory does not
directly justify or  endorse hedonism, and  more  generally insists on  the
subordination of gratification to duty, a principal result of liberal thought
has been to encourage a hedonistic ethic in place of the bourgeois ethic.
Environmentalist ideas had the effect of discrediting absolute moral values,
which were  perceived as  mere  adaptations to  particular environmental
needs. This  was  especially the  case  with  the  ideas  of  Franz  Boas,  who
developed “an anthropology that cut ground from under all absolute ideas,
particularly from under racism” and who argued that anthropology “teaches
better than any other science the relativity of the values of civilization.”
## [165]
The  development  of  human beings, in  Boas’s  view,  “coming about  in

different environments, represented specializations in different directions,
some features of each development being closer and some features farther
away  from  the  apes,”
## [166]
and  the  cultural  relativism that  this  position
implied was  developed further  by  the  work  of  Boas’s  disciples Ruth
Benedict, Margaret Mead, and others.
The purpose of environmentalism and cultural relativism in the social
sciences was  not  to  justify hedonism but  to  challenge the  orthodox
bourgeois view of moral values as grounded in an immutable human nature
and  an  invariable  universe. In  achieving this  purpose, however,  the
environmentalist and relativist argument was unable to assert any moral
ground independent of  the  cultural environment. Any  moral claim—
whether liberal  or  other—was thus  subject to  the  relativist  critique,
although, in practice, liberal claims were seldom considered as products of
a particular environment. As Eric Goldman points out,
When [reformers] said that all ideas must be related to economic interest, they did not
really mean all ideas;    they meant only their opponents’ ideas. So conservatism became a
rationalization of greed, while the tenets of progressivism were “scientific,” “objective,”
and “moral,” the same kind of absolute Truth and Good that has immemorially given men
enthusiasm for a cause.
## [167]
The inability of liberal environmentalism to justify any moral values
without contradicting its  own  premise of  the  relativity of  values  was  a
powerful reinforcement of a hedonistic ethic in the 20th century. Any moral
or  practical objection to  immediate gratification could  be  met  with  the
response that  such  objections were  merely relative, the  product of  a
particular cultural or personal bias, and an illicit and repressive restraint on
the harmless and natural pursuit of pleasure. Freudian theories of sexuality,
Marxian critiques of  “bourgeois  consciousness,” and  Karl  Mannheim’s
sociology of knowledge, as well as other ideas drawn from modern social
science, also contributed to the relativist rejection of traditional bourgeois

moral codes  and  to  the  rationalization of  a  hedonistic ethic  that  was
essential for  the  managerial stimulation of  aggregate demand  and  mass
consumption. If  the  intellectuals and  scientists who  developed relativist
theories did not always desire or foresee the practical consequences of their
ideas, the  emerging  managerial  elites  in  the  economy and  the  mass
organizations of culture and communication did perceive these implications
and drew them out as justifications for their encouragement of hedonism in
economic behavior and social manners.
The  environmentalist premises of  liberalism also  served to  justify
cosmopolitanism and to reject national, class, racial, and regional identities
on  which the bourgeois order  relied to  sustain its  localized and
particularized structure. Such identities in the environmentalist mind were
artificial labels that served only to perpetuate inter-group hostilities and
conflicts (racism, sexual discrimination, nationalism, provincialism, class
discrimination, and war) and to protect the local and private power bases of
the bourgeois elite. Liberalism thus developed an “allegiance to mankind”
that delegitimized and discredited bourgeois codes that affirmed particular
social, biological, regional, and national identities. In this respect, 20th-
century liberalism built  on  the  egalitarianism and  universal brotherhood
developed by the philosophes of the 18th century, but it did so with the
coloration of   modern scientific authority and   contemporary
environmentalist theory. The general direction of liberal thought has thus
been internationalist and universalist in world affairs and egalitarian and
homogenizing in domestic policy. Liberal ideology has generally perceived
barriers to the pursuit of liberal goals, such as nationalism, states’ rights,
provincial identity,  and  social  differentiations, as  obsolescent, artificial,
hypocritical, repressive,or masks for privilege and exploitation.

Although the  premises of  cosmopolitan ideology are  implicit  in  the
relativism and  environmentalism of  liberal thought, and  though liberal
theorists drew out these premises in the form of explicit egalitarianism and
internationalism, most  liberal political leaders did  not  emphasize
cosmopolitan themes until, in the 1960s, liberal and New Left opposition to
racial, sexual, and  economic discrimination, war,  and  national rivalries
developed. The emphasis on cosmopolitan ideology and its importation into
policies and political discourse at that time coincided with technological
and organizational innovations that made possible the dramatic enlargement
in size and scale of the mass media, which are the principal sources for the
popularization of  cosmopolitan ideology because of  their  need  for  a
homogenized mass audience susceptible to their uniform message.
## [168]
Prior to the 1960s, liberal political forces and leaders retained explicit
and public commitments to nationalism (as in Theodore Roosevelt’s “New
Nationalism” and  in  the  chauvinistic and  even  racist  themes in  liberal
propaganda in World War II) and at least tolerated racial discrimination.
Early Progressivist intellectual leaders were often educated in or strongly
influenced by managerial thought in Imperial Germany and reflected the
extreme nationalist, racialist, and  statist themes that  German thought
expressed. Moreover,  liberal compromises with  nationalism and  racism
were  acts  of  political  convenience based  on  the  political coalition that
incorporated nationalistic working-class elements and  white  Southerners
and  was  necessitated by  the  lack  of  an  instrument that  could  inculcate
cosmopolitan ideas and overcome contrary beliefs. Once such an instrument
was available in the form of the mass media of the telecommunications
revolution of the 1960s, liberal political forces used it to try to “re-educate”
the mass population in cosmopolitan ideology, though this effort has not
been  very  successful. It  is  doubtful, despite their  compromise with

nationalist and racist ideologies and institutions and the political benefits it
brought them, that  many  liberal  leaders and  thinkers were  privately
comfortable with it. One liberal who did try to re-educate Americans in
cosmopolitanism, at least in international affairs, was President Woodrow
Wilson,  whose vision of  America’s  participation in World  War  I,  the
Versailles Settlement, and the League of Nations incorporated and explicitly
appealed to  a  transnational, cosmopolitan ideology.  Wilson’s  vision, of
course, was vehemently rejected by the Senate and by public opinion. It is
likely that liberal political leaders learned from his example and that their
inclinations to  cosmopolitan ideologies and  policies remained a  largely
covert agenda until they acquired the power and the organization to assert
them more overtly and explicitly.
Liberalism and  the  managerial forces it  rationalized thus  acquired
political power by compromising with and using nationalist values in the
mass population to construct a managerial state and economy, the social,
economic, and political policies of which were tantamount to what historian
Frank Tariello, Jr., calls “empirical collectivism,” which, while it avoided a
formal commitment to  socialism, expressed the  theoretical premises of
socialism and the denial of bourgeois privacy, individuality, and private
property.
What  emerged  was  a  mixture of  free  enterprise and  governmental
regulation. In theory, however, all property was potentially liable to the
control of the state. If certain economic transactions were left uncontrolled,
it was not because of intrinsic right. Rather, the social interest presumably
was being served in the absence of regulation. . . . Because the state, acting
in the name of society, was now invested with broad, nonspecific power
over  life  and  property,  an  innately private area  of  action, based on

contractual arrangements, could not exist.
## [169]
Though the regime they built remained a soft regime, liberalism and the
managerial regime  it  defended constituted until  the  1960s a  form  of
“national socialism,” which was the common form in which the managerial
regime evolved in the Western world. “The combination of nationalism and
socialism,” writes John Lukacs,
the worldwide pattern of the political development of the twentieth century (of which
Hitler’s Nazism was a totalitarian and extremist German version) survived the war and the
demise of Hitler. Since the Second World War practically all governments of the world,
and every political party in the world, have espoused, or at least have been forced to
practice, variants of the mix of nationalism and socialism, whether they have admitted this
or not. In the United States, too, nationalism proved more powerful than internationalism
—while after the New Deal and the war a return to unbridled capitalism in the United
States was practically out of the question.
## [170]
Thus, there are some resemblances between the rhetoric and policies
espoused by both the hard and the soft managerial regimes. Adolf Hitler, in
his first speech to the German people after becoming Chancellor, promised
them what one historian has called “in effect . . . a New Deal,”
## [171]
and
President Kennedy’s most noted utterance, “Ask not what your country can
do for you but what you can do for your country,” is strikingly similar to
one of the final sentences in the principal work of the American fascist
theorist of the 1930s, Lawrence Dennis: “A nation is a nation by reason of
what its citizens have done for it rather than because of what it has done for
them.”
## [172]
The  abandonment  of  nationalism and  the  overt  appeal to
cosmopolitanism by managerial forces since the 1960s and the failure of the
managerial regime to eradicate nationalist and racist beliefs in the mass
population has  significantly contributed to  the  principal crisis  of  the
managerial political apparatus, which in  recent years  has  sought  to  re-
capture the nationalist instincts and thus the political allegiance of the mass
population.

Despite variations in emphasis on solidarist and cosmopolitan themes
due  to  political circumstance and  convenience, the  mainstream of  the
formal content of 20th-century liberal thought has served to rationalize the
scientism, utopianism, cosmopolitanism, and hedonism that  characterize
managerial humanism and reflect the functioning of the soft managerial
regime. Liberalism has also, through the policies and legislation associated
with it, encouraged the evolution of the structures of the regime and their
integrated functioning. This should be sufficiently obvious in the case of the
mass state. American liberalism from the Progressive era through the New
Deal  to  the Great  Society to  the  present day  has  consistently defended
increases in the size, authority, and functions of the central government and
especially of the executive branch. In 1885 Simon Patten, the Progressive
economist, joined  with  his  like-minded colleague Richard C.  Ely,  who
exerted a profound influence on the formation of American liberalism, to
found the American Economic Association, the initial manifesto of which
declared its faith in a view of “the state as an educational and ethical agency
whose positive aid is an indispensable condition to human progress,” and
this attitude, if not the actual formulation, continues to underlie the liberal
view of the state and its role in mass society. Liberal publicists and scholars
—Walter Lippmann, Woodrow Wilson, and Clinton Rossiter, among others
—were among the principal critics of congressional government and the
principal theorists  of  the  development of  an  “imperial presidency” that
corresponds to  the  Caesarist tendencies of  the  managerial regime, its
propensity to  ally  with  the  mass  population against the bourgeois  order
through a charismatic leader who institutionalizes a bureaucratic elite in the
managerial state. “American historians and political scientists, this writer
among them,” writes Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.,
labored to  give  the  expansive theory  of  the  Presidency historical sanction.
Overgeneralizing from the pre-war contrast between a President who was right [i.e., who

favored intervention in  World  War  II]  and  a  Congress which was  wrong, scholars
developed an uncritical cult of the activist Presidency.
## [173]
Although foreign  policy—the interventionist and  globalist ambitions
and  interests of  the  emerging  managerial regime—was, in  Schlesinger’s
view, the principal cause of the expansion of presidential power,
the economic changes of the twentieth century had conferred vast new powers not just on
the  national  government  but  more  particularly on  the  Presidency.  .  .  .  History had
demonstrated beyond any  social  interest in  further experiment that  a  high-technology
economy would not, left alone, necessarily, or even probably, balance out at levels of high
employment. It had demonstrated further that unregulated economic private ownership
generated excessive inequality in the distribution of income, wealth and power and could
not  restrain  greed from  exploiting human labor  or  from  despoiling the  natural
environment. . . . The managed economy, in short, offered new forms of unilateral power
to the President who was bold enough to take action on his own.
## [174]
The revolution of mass and scale in the economy thus necessitates the
expansion of the state, especially its executive branch, the fusion of the
economy with the state, and the alliance of the managerial state with the
lower classes of the bourgeois economic order.
In addition to providing justification for the evolution of the mass state
and managerial Caesarism, liberalism also has justified and encouraged the
rise of the mass corporation and its integration with the managerial state,
and indeed the liberal rationalization for the mass state is closely linked
with the liberal defense of the managerial economy. The same scientism
that informed liberal views of how to reform the social environment also
operated in liberal and progressive views of the economy. Industrial and
technological achievements in the control of natural forces and materials
encouraged liberals of the late 19th century to believe that similar control
could be achieved in social and economic arrangements. The application of
science to human affairs in “deliberate social experiment and planning” was
thus not confined to governmentally sponsored reforms but extended also to
the corporation and mass communications.

Frederick W.  Taylor’s achievements in scientific industrial management,
George Harvey’s manipulation of public opinion as “public relations” agent
for industrial corporations, city planning, resources conservation, and the
birth-control movement were all previous practical emanations of the same
spirit.
## [175]
The application of progressive scientism in business management in the
early 20th century was encouraged by the publication of 240 works on
management between 1900 and 1910 and by the founding of the Harvard
Business School in 1908.
[U]p-to-date managers  rationalized assembly lines,  introduced piecework payment
wherever possible, and offered special incentives for speed. . . . They discovered that even
expensive welfare work, if intelligently carried on, might pay dividends. Good conditions,
special facilities, and short hours not only increased production but permitted wage cuts. [ .
. . ] Profit sharing and stock purchase at rates below the market were other devices used to
speed work, indoctrinate employees, and reduce turnover.
## [176]
In addition to promoting “business liberalism” or “welfare capitalism,”
which itself  served to  expand the  functions and  services performed by
business enterprises and  their  need  for  a  “technostructure” or  corps  of
managerial specialists, the new liberalism also encouraged the growth of
mass  corporations. Herbert Croly’s The Promise of American Life
(1909) was particularly influential in popularizing within the Progressive
movement a belief in corporate conglomerates, closely supervised by and
allied  with  the  federal government,  and  was  especially influential on
Theodore Roosevelt’s “New Nationalism” in his campaign of 1912. What
Roosevelt proposed in the campaign was
a dynamic democracy, that would recognize the inevitability of concentration in industry
and bring the great corporations under complete federal control, that would protect and
encourage the laboring man, that, in brief, would do many of the things usually associated
with the modern concept of the welfare state.
## [177]
This  “Hamiltonian”  view  of  a  closely integrated corporate-state

economy was shared by an increasing number of businessmen themselves,
notably by  Roosevelt’s  friends, George  W.  Perkins,  a  partner of
J.P.  Morgan, and Frank Munsey, both of whom were associated with the
U.S.   Steel Corporation. Munsey told Roosevelt that “the state has got to . . .
take  on  a  more  paternal guardianship of  the  people. The  people  need
safeguarding in  their  investments, their  savings, their  application of
conservation.” Although Croly’s thought and that of Perkins and Munsey
often diverged, both joined in a “common opposition to the Jeffersonian
reform program of  ‘restoring’  an  America of  small, freely competing
economic units” that was essentially bourgeois and classically liberal in
contrast to the managerial, mass organizational, 20th-century liberal view of
a fused political-economic regime. By the 1920s,
Businessmen were even taking over the progressive doctrine of putting the government
still further into business and were using it for their own purposes. . . . The kind of
thinking that a few Eastern businessmen like George Perkins and Frank Munsey had been
doing in the heyday of Roosevelt’s New Nationalism now began to seep through chambers
of  commerce  all  over  the  country.  .  .  .  vanguard thinking among businessmen in  the
postwar period was not opposed to governmental intervention in economic life. The new
thinking was  all  for  intervention—provided that  businessmen or  business-minded
politicians conducted the intervention.
## [178]
Nor was this view confined to the Democratic Party. “Neither Harding,
Coolidge,  nor  Hoover  represented  the  old  idea  of  free  enterprise,” and
Hoover in particular “as Secretary of Commerce from 1921 to 1929 and
then  as  President, systematically pushed the  businessman’s  type  of
governmental intervention.”
## [179]
The bourgeois ideal of small firms freely competing with each other
under a neutral government was associated with much of the rank and file
of the Progressive movement and found expression in the 1912 campaign of
Woodrow Wilson  and  his  adviser Louis  Brandeis.
## [180]
Although  some
branches of liberal thought have retained this ideal, after Wilson’s term it

never  exerted any  considerable  influence within liberal circles and  has
become characteristic of  contemporary conservative thought. The
“Jeffersonian” ideals of Wilson’s “New Freedom” found expression earlier
in the “trust-busting” of the Progressive movement and especially in the
Sherman Anti-Trust  Act  of  1890.  Ironically,  this  Act  exerted an  effect
exactly the opposite of the intentions of its sponsors. Although public policy
and legislation was of secondary importance in the expansion of the size of
American corporations, writes Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.,
the  Sherman Act,  which was  passed as  a  protest against the  massive number  of
combinations that  occurred during the  1870s and  1880s, clearly discouraged the
continuation of loose horizontal federations of small manufacturing enterprises formed to
control price and production. [Supreme Court] decisions . . . hastened the coming of legal
consolidation. These decisions provided a powerful pressure for a combination of family
firms to merge into a single, legally defined enterprise. And such a legal organization was
the  essential precondition for  administrative centralization  and  vertical integration.
Without the Sherman Act and these judicial interpretations, the cartels of small family
firms owning and operating single-function enterprises might well have continued into the
twentieth century in the United States as they did in Europe.
## [181]
The  “New  Nationalism” flourished  under  Franklin Roosevelt’s  early
New  Deal,  when  it  became the  formative ideological movement  of  the
“Brain Trust” and New Deal legislation.
Most influential were the theorists of the New Nationalism: Theodore Roosevelt, Charles
Van Hise, Simon Patten, Walter Weyl, Herbert Croly, and the Walter Lippmann of Drift
and Mastery. . . . Roosevelt’s advisers of the early New Deal scoffed at the nineteenth-
century faith in natural law and free competition; argued for a frank acceptance of the large
corporation; and dismissed the New Freedom’s emphasis on trust-busting as a reactionary
dogma that  would prevent an  organic  approach to  directing the  economy.  .  .  .  The
enormously influential studies of  Berle  [himself a  member of  the  Brain  Trust]  and
Gardiner C.  Means reinforced these views. They concluded that monopoly and oligopoly
had become not the exception but the rule; that the market no longer performed its classic
function of maintaining an equilibrium between supply and demand; and that, in the new
“administered market,” the two thousand men who controlled American economic life
manipulated prices and production.
## [182]
Indeed, in  addition to  Berle  and  Means, another prophet  of  the
managerial revolution, Thorstein Veblen, “had a special place: his emphasis

on the hostility between technology and finance, his skepticism about an
apocalyptic struggle  ending in  a  dictatorship of  the  proletariat, and  his
advocacy of an elite of social engineers attracted men like Tugwell, Jerome
Frank, and Isador Lubin.”
## [183]
Roosevelt’s  administration moved away  from  the  New  Nationalist
orientation in the late 1930s, but with the maturation of the managerial
regime in the Roosevelt-Truman era and during and after World War II,
American liberalism formulated its basic vision of the fused state-corporate
order in the later work of A. A.   Berle, John Kenneth Galbraith, and other
economists. What New Left historians in the 1960s began to call “corporate
liberalism,” “liberals in  service to  the  large  business corporations,”
developed systematically in liberal thought and policy in the 1950s and
## 1960s.
Intellectual liberals unashamedly asserted the  benevolence of  large
corporations and defended the existing distribution of wealth and power in
America. Political  liberals assumed corporate hegemony and  pursued
policies to  strengthen it.  The  quintessential corporate liberal  was  John
F.  Kennedy, who never pretended to be otherwise and for whom the good
opinion of big business was the highest political priority.
## [184]
Soon after his inauguration, President Kennedy formulated his creed to
an audience of corporate leaders: “far from being natural enemies,” said the
President, “government and business are necessary allies.”
## [185]
It was logical that Keynesian economic theory, with its advocacy of
manipulating aggregate demand through monetary and fiscal policy and its
defense of deficit financing (which itself challenged traditional bourgeois
notions of  frugality and  contributed  to  the  popularization of hedonism)

should become the  operative economic ideology of  liberalism from  the
Depression through the 1970s. Keynesian ideas justified the integration of
mass  corporations  with  the  mass  state  and  the  development of  a  large,
socially and  economically active  government spending public funds  for
welfare programs that would provide a “floor” for mass consumption by the
underclass at  the  expense of  the  middle classes and  the  bourgeoisie.
Keynesian theory  also  justified the  further expansion of  the  executive
branch and the political uses of the managerial executive.
The  Keynesian instrumentalities of  government were  an  intelligent response to  public
necessity. But they were instrumentalities designed for executive use. . . . [I]f the President
could control employment and investment through the manipulation of the budget, he
could do this for the benefit of the industries and regions that gave him steadiest support.
## [186]
The support of managerial corporations and their elite for liberal and
Keynesian policies and  ideology was  encouraged by  Paul  Hoffman  and
Beardsley Ruml,  a  businessman and  academic whom Robert Maynard
Hutchins had called “the founder of social sciences in America,” and who
played an instrumental role in persuading both Franklin Roosevelt and his
advisers as well as representatives of the business establishment of the ideas
of  Keynesianism and  the  role  of  the  national government in economic
planning. These ideas  were  incorporated in  Hoffman’s Committee for
Economic Development, founded in 1942, which supported the basic ideas
of the New Deal and which expressed the “social responsibilities creed of
the  Progressive Era.”
## [187]
Although businessmen and  corporate managers
continued to express faith in the principles of entrepreneurial capitalism,
they gradually accepted the fusion of state and economy that was evolving.
In 1964, given a clear choice between the epitome of managerial liberalism
in  the  administration of  Lyndon  Johnson and  the  quaintly bourgeois
candidacy of Barry Goldwater,

The nation’s corporate elite, abandoning its traditional preference for the GOP, voted for
the  party  that  had  stimulated sales,  fueled profits, and  lowered corporate taxes.  An
estimated 60 percent or more of the Business Council—the semi-official link between the
corporations and the government—favored LBJ. The lion’s share of the big contributions
flowed into his campaign coffers.
## [188]
There is therefore a close relationship between the ideas and policies of
20th-century American liberalism and  the  growth of  mass  corporations
managed by professional technicians and integrated with the mass state; the
relationship is at least as close as that between liberalism and the rise of the
mass state itself. Similarly, liberalism has rationalized the enlargement in
mass and scale of the organizations of culture and communication, their
control by a professional technical elite of managers, and their integration
with  the  fused  political-economic apparatus of  the  managerial regime.
Indeed, liberalism has been the principal ideology to which the intellectual
and verbalist professions, which constitute the managerial elite in the mass
media organizations, has subscribed.
Like the enlargement of mass corporate and governmental structures in
the 20th century, the enlargement of the mass organizations of culture and
communication—mass education and mass, secularized religion as well as
the communications industries and professions themselves in advertising,
entertainment, publishing, journalism, broadcasting, and  film—was the
result of economic, technological, and organizational developments in the
late  19th  and  early  20th  centuries. The  elite  that  emerged  in  these
organizations, the  intellectual and  verbalist class or  managerial
intelligentsia, operates  and  directs them  through its  managerial skills  in
performing technical, administrative, and  communicational functions.
Liberalism serves to  rationalize, identify,  and  communicate the  group
interests of  the  intellectual and  verbalist class,  and  adherence to  liberal
ideology by  the  members of  this  class  is  perhaps due  less  to  their

commitment to  the  formal goals  and  values of  liberalism than  to  a
consciousness of  their  social  interests and  needs  and  of  the  role  liberal
ideology plays in legitimizing these interests and needs.
The ideology of liberalism corresponds to the group interests, values,
and aspirations of the intellectual and verbalist class in several ways. First,
the  formal doctrines of  liberalism articulate ideals of  expansive civil
liberties, freedom of  expression, intellectual pluralism, and  the  “open
society,”  and  these  ideals rationalize and  are  consistent with  the
professional needs and interests of intellectuals and verbalists, who make
their living and gain social rewards by communicating—writing, speaking,
performing, designing, creating,  editing, teaching, discussing,  debating.
Intellectuals and verbalists thus possess a group interest in perpetuating and
expanding intellectual pluralism.
Secondly,  liberalism is  supportive of  ideas of  social change,
amelioration, innovation, and  progress that  attract intellectuals and
rationalize both their group interests in designing and implementing social
change as  well  as  their  resentments against a  society they  perceive as
hostile, repressive,  anti-intellectual,  and  philistine. Richard Hofstadter
pointed to the sense of resentment against the bourgeois plutocracy among
American academics as a source of their Progressivist orientation at the end
of the 19th century, and Daniel Bell has noted the rejection of bourgeois
social and moral codes by intellectuals in the same period in the form of
“bohemianism,” a rejection that led to increasingly radical and eccentric
ideas and life-styles.
## [189]
Thirdly, the formal content of liberalism is supportive of rationality and
the role of reason and intelligence in social and political affairs, and it
challenges the allocation of social rewards on the basis of such non-rational

attributes as  inherited status, adherence to  moral values, and  class,
ideological, religious, racial, and sexual identities that are unconnected to
“merit.”  The  formal ideas  of  liberalism are  thus  consistent with  a
characteristic function of  the  intellectual and  verbalist profession—its
adherence to rationality in its intellectual and communicational role—and
its  aspiration to  apply  rationality to  social and  political arrangements.
Liberal defense of rationality and intelligence against the claims of non-
rational status also corresponds to the personal ideals, values, self-images,
and egos of intellectuals and verbalists and is in part a reflection of the non-
rational psychological impulses  of  the  intellectual class.  In  addition to
legitimizing the group interests of the intellectual and verbalist class by
rationalizing the  role  of  intellectuals and  verbalists in  designing and
managing social  change, then,  liberalism also  serves the  social and
psychological needs of this class by enhancing its status and self-esteem.
The  interests of  the  intellectual  and  verbalist profession parallel and
correspond to the functional imperatives of the managerial regime, and the
formal doctrines of liberalism provide rationalizations for these imperatives
as well as for the interests and needs of the intelligentsia. Liberalism thus
serves to integrate the intelligentsia within the regime and to rationalize its
attachment to the managerial apparatus of power. The functioning of the
regime depends  upon  merit, defined as  proficiency in  managerial and
technical skills and their applications to political, economic, and cultural
arrangements, and the rationalization of the role of reason and intelligence
in  social  and  political affairs  that  liberalism offers  corresponds  to  this
dependence. The identification of “merit” with managerial proficiency is
clear in Michael Young’s satirical portrait of “meritocracy” in the fictional
future of 2034:
Today we have an élite selected according to brains and educated according to deserts,

with a grounding in philosophy and administration as well as in the two S’s of science and
sociology. . . . Today we frankly recognize that democracy can be no more than aspiration,
and have rule not so much by the people as by the cleverest people; not an aristocracy of
birth, not a plutocracy of wealth, but a true meritocracy of talent.
## [190]
The regime also depends on a continuous process of social change and
innovation that not only enhances the dominance and rewards of those elites
that  manage  and  manipulate change but  also  challenges and  weakens
bourgeois  institutions and  values. The  support that  liberalism offers  for
continuous social  progress and  amelioration, designed and  managed by
elites, corresponds to  and  rationalizes this  dependence on  managed
innovation. Moreover,  because of  its  imperative of  continuous managed
innovation, the functioning of the regime also depends on the continuous
production, dissemination, and evaluation of new ideas, values, policies,
and  techniques that  instigate innovation; the  intellectual pluralism, civil
liberties, and  open  society that  liberal ideology supports provide
rationalizations for this imperative.
In the managerial regime, however, as in any regime, not all issues and
values are equally open to debate. The “open society” of the managers is
“open” mainly to anti-bourgeois discussion, to ideas and values that serve to
criticize and discredit the institutions and power of the bourgeois order. It is
considerably less receptive to anti-managerial and pro-bourgeois ideas and
values that resist or challenge the premises and structures of the managerial
regime itself. Thus, the  tolerance, libertarianism, and  openness of
managerial society are limited and selective, and this selectivity reflects the
tendency of Progressivist liberalism, pointed out by Eric Goldman, to apply
its relativist critiques only to anti-liberal ideas and values. The limitations
and  selectivity of  managerial  liberalism represent no  threat to  the
intellectual and verbalist professions of the managerial regime, however,
since these groups have little inclination to adopt anti-managerial ideas and

no  interests  in  transgressing these  limits. Their  adherence to  ideas  and
values that  are  consistent with  the  functional imperatives of  the  regime
rationalizes their  own  functions and  rewards within the  regime. Their
dissidence and  criticism are  largely  confined to  challenging persistent
bourgeois elements, and much of what the managerial intelligentsia boasts
of as courageous dissent and radicalism often in fact accrues to its own
benefit as well as to the advantage of the managerial apparatus of power.
The principal location of the managerial intelligentsia lies in the mass
educational and research institutions, which constitute the apex of the mass
organizations of culture and communication and the core institutions for the
production and dissemination of new ideas and knowledge for application
to  the  goals  of  social  reconstruction, as  well  as  for  the  discussion and
evaluation of  these  ideas,  the  formulation of  the  critiques of  bourgeois
institutions and  values, and  the  articulation of  managerial ideology. As
Hofstadter suggested, however,  the  managerial state  and  other  mass
organizations of culture and communication besides the educational and
research organizations also exhibit a need for and offer significant material
and political rewards to the intellectual and verbalist class as the agents of
the design and implementation of social reconstruction:
The  development of  regulative and  humane legislation required the
skills of lawyers and economists, sociologists and political scientists, in the
writing of laws and in the staffing of administrative and regulative bodies.
Controversy over  such  issues created a  new  market for  the  books and
magazine articles of the experts and engendered a new respect for their
specialized knowledge. Reform brought with it the brain trust.
## [191]
In  short,  the revolution of  mass  and  scale  and  the  evolution of  the
managerial state  (as  well  as  the  managerial corporations and  the  mass

organizations of  culture and  communication themselves) provide
considerable rewards in salaries, royalties, celebrity, status, and power for
the intelligentsia. Liberalism offers a rationalization for the functions the
intelligentsia performs in the managerial regime and legitimizes the social
rewards it receives. The adoption of liberalism as the characteristic ideology
of the managerial intelligentsia means that the intellectuals and verbalists in
the  mass  organizations of  culture and  communication infuse liberal
ideology throughout the  apparatus of  mass communications, and  this
apparatus disseminates the ideas, values, images, and symbols of liberal
ideology throughout the  mass  population. In  this  way,  the  managerial
organizations of culture and communication—in education, religion, and
the  mass  communications industries and  professions—seek to  inculcate
liberalism as the public orthodoxy of managerial society and to discipline
and  integrate the  mass  population through the  legitimization and
popularization of liberal formulas and symbols.
Liberal doctrine concerning the  rights and  value of  intellectual
expression interact with its environmentalist premises and its advocacy of
mass organizations in state and economy to provide rationalizations for the
enlargement of the organizations of culture and communication, their fusion
with those of the state and economy, and the dominance of managerial elites
within them.  Liberalism has  played a  central role  in  rationalizing the
development of mass education, its evolution as instruction in practical and
utilitarian skills  and  knowledge that  are  vital  to  the  functions  of  the
managerial elite,  its  fusion with  the  managerial state  and  economy,  its
direction by  specially trained managers of  education, and  its  uses  as  a
vehicle for the delegitimization of bourgeois codes and the inculcation of
the codes of managerial liberalism in the pupils and students of the mass
educational system. These new  educational functions reflect the

transformation of education by the revolution of mass and scale of the late
19th century, and the ideas that justify them represent an effort to adapt
educational institutions and  methods to  the  new  mass  society that  was
emerging.  Progressive education,  which  “began  as  Progressivism in
education,” meant
broadening the program and function of the school to include direct concern for health,
vocation, and the quality of family and community life . . . applying in the classroom the
pedagogical principles derived from new scientific research in psychology and the social
sciences . . . [and] tailoring instruction more and more to the different kinds and classes of
children who  were  being  brought within the  purview of  the  school. .  .  .  Finally,
Progressivism implied the radical faith that culture could be democratized without being
vulgarized, the faith that everyone could share not only in the benefits of the new sciences
but in the pursuit of the arts as well.
## [192]
The justification of these functions of education are clear in the ideas of
Lester Frank Ward  and  John  Dewey,  among the  principal theoretical
architects of mass education. To Ward, “fundamentally an environmentalist”
who  with Albion Small  reformulated “the  harsh  Spencerian doctrine of
social Darwinism into a full-fledged philosophy of meliorism,”
## [193]
and a
leader of  Progressive thought at  the  end  of  the  19th  century,  “social
salvation lay  in  a  vast  diffusion  of  information, especially scientific
information, among the citizenry at large. . . . Education that was scientific,
popular, and universal could be the ‘mainspring of progress’.”
## [194]
## Formal
education was  “a  systematic process for  the  manufacture of  correct
opinions” and should be under the exclusive control of the government to
prevent the intrusion of undesirable elements; “the result desired by the
state is a wholly different one from that desired by parents, guardians, and
pupils.”
## [195]
Ward’s  ideas  acquired influence through the  work  of  his  principal
disciple, Albion Small, and Small’s younger colleague, John Dewey, who
rejected the  restriction of  the  school curriculum to  subjects useful to

traditional elites and advocated the incorporation of vocational, scientific,
and industrial subjects as relevant to the needs of an industrial society and
who viewed education as “a regulation of the process of coming to share in
the social consciousness . . . the adjustment of individual activity on the
basis  of  this  social  consciousness is  the  only  sure  method  of  social
reconstruction.”
## [196]
The  extension of  educational functions to  health,
vocation, family,  and  community  relations, the  reduction of  the  role  of
parents and  community in  education, and  the  Progressive concern with
education as an instrument of “social reconstruction” offered an opportunity
for  the  emerging  managerial elites  in  mass  educational organizations to
direct and control the socialization of the mass population at an early age, to
challenge the primacy of bourgeois and traditional institutions and values,
and to carry out the social engineering, therapeutic, and utopian goals of the
managerial state.  The  advocacy of  vocational, technical, and  industrial
curricula corresponded to  increasing demands of  businessmen for
instruction in such studies as a means of achieving industrial efficiency.
## [197]

The  beginnings  of  the  fusion of  mass  education with  the  mass  state
developed under  the  administration of  the  Smith-Hughes Act  of  1917,
which provided limited federal aid for education, by the U.S.    Office of
Education, which “became a prime propagator of progressivism.” The trend
toward centralization and uniformity in mass education was promoted by
the  National Education Association, which “became an  influential
proponent of reform” and used its power in the cause of progressivism.
At  the  state  level  newly professionalized departments of  education
sponsored a plethora of publications . . . as well as conferences, institutes,
and seminars designed to put hitherto isolated teachers and administrators
in touch with the latest pedagogical thought. Needless to say, progressive
ideas and practices were widely disseminated, with state aid and favor as

the reward for interested localities.
## [198]
Liberalism also offered a means of rationalizing and encouraging the
expansion of  university functions  and  the  influence of  their  faculties.
Although university faculties in  19th-century America had  been  largely
conservative and supportive of the bourgeois order, the spread of liberalism
as the operative ideology of American academics took place in tandem with
the expansion of universities at the end of the century, an expansion that
represents the revolution of mass and scale in the institutions of higher
education.
The sudden emergence of the modern university, however, transformed
American scholarship during the last three decades of the century. Where
there had been only a number of denominational colleges, there were now
large universities with adequate libraries, laboratories, huge endowments,
graduate schools,  professional schools, and  advancing salaries. The
professoriat was growing immensely in numbers, improving in professional
standards, gaining in compensation and security, and acquiring a measure of
influence and prestige in and out of the classroom that their predecessors of
the old college era would never have dreamed of.
## [199]
Faculties in this era still tended to be conservative, but there was “a
large creative minority that set itself up as a sort of informal brain trust to
the  Progressive movement.”
## [200]
The  tensions  within the  American
university between the bourgeois trustees and the conservative faculties, on
the one hand, and the new managerial intelligentsia within the universities
on the other were reflected in the struggle for “academic freedom” (i.e., the
control of the university by liberal managerial elements rather than by the
trustees or local, bourgeois-dominated governments and communities), a
struggle in  which the American Association of  University Professors

(AAUP), founded in 1915 as a vehicle for the new academic profession,
played a  major role.  By  the  post-World  War  II  era,  the  American
intelligentsia had almost uniformly adopted liberalism as its professional
ideology and had come to constitute an elite in itself.
The  liberal  mood  of  1960  was  largely  defined by  elite  intellectuals
residing on the East Coast, principally in New York City and Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Constituting an  intense subculture at  the  center of  the
nation’s  communication network,  these  intellectuals—nearly all  of  them
liberals—shared a  world view  that  profoundly influenced the  political
climate in this election year.
## [201]
Liberal advocacy of  increased federal subsidization of  universities,
science, scholarship, and students and of progressive education in business
and public administration rationalizes the fusion of the managerial academy
with the state and corporations.
The New Deal itself also vastly expanded federal educational programs
through its relief agencies and, despite the demise of these agencies after
World War II, encouraged the creation and the aspirations of an educational
elite that possessed a vested interest, and an ideology to rationalize it, in
federal assistance to  education. Liberal support for  federal educational
programs also appeared in President Kennedy’s proposal to provide $2.3
billion over three years to local school districts in 1961, a plan the Congress
rejected.
## [202]
The mass educational and research organizations are core institutions of
the managerial regime that provide the technical skills on which managerial
elites in the state, economy, and culture depend and also are the institutional
sources for the formulation of the most sophisticated versions of managerial

liberalism. Yet the mass communications industries and secularized, mass
religion are also central to the managerial regime through their function of
disseminating popular versions of managerial liberalism that legitimize and
integrate the mass population within the regime. Thus, Kevin P.  Phillips
argues that by the 1960s
The fashionable media substantially interacted with other involved and growing segments
of  the  knowledge industry: universities, think-tanks, foundations, social and  welfare
workers, urban planners, and so forth. The New York-Washington media axis became
closely linked, in succession, to the liberal integration, anti-poverty, anti-hunger, anti-war,
and ecology causes. . . . While the media in Chillicothe or Peoria might be spokesmen for
local  families,  banks,  or  industries, the  New  York-and-Washington-based media were
emerging as pre-eminent spokesmen for the causes of interest-group liberalism.
## [203]
Liberalism has served the mass media of the communications industries
through its defense of civil liberties, opposition to libel litigation, and broad
interpretations of the First Amendment and their application against state
and local censorship statutes and practices. Some of the more important
decisions of  the  U.S.    Supreme  Court  against libel  litigation involved
judgments in favor of large media and against individuals associated with
bourgeois or anti-managerial forces, and decisions against local censorship
of books, films, newspapers, and periodicals typically involved judgments
in favor of the media and against local authorities. The American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU), by far the most important and influential liberal
group working for the extension of civil liberties, did so as a means of
challenging bourgeois economic institutions, social codes, legal principles,
and  local  political  structures.
## [204]
Granted virtual immunity to  local
bourgeois interference through broad interpretations of  the  First
Amendment, the mass communications industries and the intellectual and
verbalist professions as a whole have acquired a privileged position that
essentially fuses them with the managerial state and allows them to function
as organs or agents of investigation and intelligence-gathering, propaganda,

and  the  manipulation of  images, symbols, and  language  for  the
legitimization of  the  managerial regime and  the  delegitimization of  its
critics and anti-managerial institutions and ideologies.
Similarly, liberalism has offered rationalizations for the secularization of
religion and  the  expansion of  church functions and  services, and
secularized, liberal religious thought has offered a moral and intellectual
defense of the evolution and structure of the managerial state. The Social
Gospel movement of the late 19th and 20th centuries, the “central idea” of
which “is  that  the  redemption or  salvation of  mankind collectively,  the
regeneration of the social order, is the ultimate goal of religion,” served to
alter the focus of traditional bourgeois religion from the spiritual concerns
of the individual to the secular functions of mass society, and it represents
“the most far-reaching and apparently permanent moral reconstruction in
American religion.”
## [205]
The principal theorists of the Social Gospel sought
“to reorient the historic faith of America to an industrial society,” developed
a moral and religious critique of laissez-faire capitalism, the neutralist state,
and bourgeois individualism, and articulated a theological defense of the
expansion of the functions and services of the state as well as those of the
churches as a response to the social breakdown and crises of the revolution
of  mass  and  scale.
## [206]
The  same  ideas  appear in  the  more  recent
involvement of  religious leaders and  groups in  pacifism, social  reform
movements, and  liberation theology.  The  elites  of  the  mass  religious
organizations and movements in managerial society thus find liberalism a
convenient body of ideas for the rationalization of their secular functions,
the encouragement of the expansion of mass religion and the mass state,
and their replacement of the traditional concerns of religion and its leaders
with their own concerns and leadership; and secularized liberal religious
ideas  and  their  mass  dissemination  through the  churches and  religious

media and organizations assist the legitimization of the managerial regime
and its discipline of mass society.
From its origins in the Progressivist thought and political movements of
the late 19th and early 20th centuries, liberalism has served as an ideology
of an emergent managerial elite. Like Mosca’s “political formulas,” liberal
ideology has provided “a moral and legal basis,” as well as a scientific and
philosophical authority, for the power of the elite and its struggle against its
bourgeois  rival.  Liberalism offered  rationalizations for  the  interests and
aspirations of  managerial forces  and  challenged the legitimacy of  the
ideological defenses of the bourgeois elite. It identified and communicated
these interests by encoding them as its values and ideals, and it sought to
integrate the  subordinate population of  managerial society into  the
managerial regime by disseminating and inculcating these values and ideals
through the mass educational and religious cultural organizations and the
media of mass communication.
Through its  incorporation of  the  environmentalist and  optimistic
premises of Progressivist thought, liberalism provided rationalizations for
the scientism, meliorism and utopianism, hedonism, and cosmopolitanism
that reflect the functional imperatives of the soft managerial regime and
legitimized the enlargement of mass organizations in the state, economy,
and  culture.  The  support of  liberalism for  expanded civil  liberties and
freedom of expression guaranteed by the managerial state and for the role
of  rationality,  intelligence, and  knowledge in  the  ameliorative
reconstruction of  society provided rationalizations for  the  interests and
aspirations of the managerial intelligentsia. The intellectual architects of
Progressivist thought worked with and supported the emergent elites of the
managerial state and the managerial economy in the construction of the

mass  organizations  of  the  regime and  their  fusion into  an  enduring
apparatus of power.
Liberalism, it may be granted, is not a highly systematic or rigorous
ideology, and it is logically possible to accept some parts of its doctrine and
reject or neglect other parts. Some exponents of liberal ideas developed
different and conflicting vehicles for their justification, and some groups in
society emphasized different elements of liberal thought at the expense of
others. Early exponents of the New Nationalism, including Herbert Croly,
expressed skepticism toward the relativism implicit in the environmentalist
premises of liberal thought, yet these premises and the utopian and relativist
ideas associated with them have persisted in the liberal mind. “The New
Dealers,” writes William Leuchtenburg, “shared John Dewey’s conviction
that organized social intelligence could shape society, and some, like Berle,
reflected the hope of the Social Gospel of creating a Kingdom of God on
earth.”
## [207]
Environmentalist theory was basic to Gunnar Myrdal’s study of
race in America, which was heavily influenced by Boasian anthropologists,
and to liberal support for the civil rights movement, and environmentalist
premises also underlay the War on Poverty in the 1960s. In the 1960s and
1970s, the exponents of liberalism extended environmentalist theory from
its application to racial and economic issues to feminism, education, sexual
mores and behavior, the family, and social issues generally.
Liberalism, then,  has  retained  its  scientistic and  environmentalist
premises and what were taken to be their melioristic or utopian, hedonistic,
and cosmopolitan implications as well as its faith in the mass state, the mass
corporation, and the mass organizations of culture and communication as
the instruments of the continuing amelioration of the human condition. The
emphasis that liberalism has placed on the different elements of its doctrine

has  varied with  the  inclinations of  its  chief  exponents, the  political
constraints on them, and the particular challenges they sought to meet,    but
the emphasis has varied also with the fluctuations of the interests of the
managerial forces  in  society.  The  adaptations of  the  formal content of
liberalism to these fluctuations reveals the further ideological value of its
doctrines in providing rationalizations for the interests and needs of the
managerial apparatus of  power and  those  groups that  gain  power and
rewards from the apparatus.

The Adaptations of Liberalism in the
## Managerial Regime
By the end of World War II, the managerial elite had essentially won its
conflict with the bourgeois order, had begun to construct a managerial state
in which it was the dominant element, had secured control of the mass
corporations and the mass organizations of culture and communication, and
had made considerable progress in fusing the three sectors and establishing
its  national (and  even  global) dominance. The  relationship between the
managerial and bourgeois forces was now reversed; the managers became
the  dominant minority in  the  United States, and  the  bourgeoisie was
demoted to the subordinate status of a sub-elite. The principal need of the
managerial elite in the period after it had acquired dominance therefore was
not  to  challenge bourgeois  ideology and  institutions but  to  legitimize,
stabilize, and consolidate its own regime. Changes in the formal ideas and
values expressed by exponents of liberal ideology reflected this change in
the  circumstances and  position of  managerial forces and  provided new
formulas of rationalizations for the new interests and needs generated by the
different circumstances of dominance as an incumbent elite.
What came to be known as “consensus” liberalism in the 1950s and
early 1960s was the principal ideological formulation that reflected the new
circumstances of  managerial dominance. The  expression of  scientistic,
hedonistic, meliorist  or  utopian, and  cosmopolitan ideas  and  values and
their  environmentalist and  relativist premises, which had  served to
challenge and  discredit bourgeois ideology and  institutions and  to
rationalize the construction of the social engineering state, mass economic

organizations, and mass organizations of culture and communication, was
muted (but  not  abandoned) in  liberal thought. Liberal criticism of  the
“affluent society” suggested a  modification of hedonism, and  liberals
articulated a tepid nationalism that defended loyalty programs and an anti-
communist foreign policy (to be implemented largely by the managerial
reconstruction of  “underdeveloped”—i.e., non-managerial—societies and
the transmission of managerial skills and ideologies to their elites). Arthur
M. Schlesinger,  Jr.  in The Vital  Center  (1949)  and  Reinhold Niebuhr
expressed a  moderate pessimism  about  human nature that  qualified the
optimistic, environmentalist, and utopian premises of liberal doctrine. Post-
war  liberalism emphasized “consensus,” the  “end  of  ideology,”  and  a
pluralism that included mainly managerial forces but excluded and scorned
challenges to  the  managerial regime and  its  ideological consensus from
either the right or the left.
Yet the managerial regime could not completely abandon its need to
design and implement social reconstruction, partly because bourgeois and
anti-managerial forces retained enough power to resist and challenge the
managerial apparatus and  its  policies and  partly  because the  skills  and
functions that  the  managerial elite  performs necessarily involve their
application to  social institutions and  relationships and  therefore a
continuing process of  social innovation and  reconstruction. As Kevin
Phillips has noted in regard to the “managers and theoreticians who deal in
ideas  and  methods” and  who  increasingly dominate the  economy and
political apparatus of mass society,
They approach society from a new vantage point. Their capital is movable, not fixed. . . .
Change does not threaten the affluent intelligentsia of the Post-Industrial Society the way it
threatened the landowners and industrialists of the New Deal. On the contrary, change is as
essential to the knowledge sector as inventory turnover is to a merchant or manufacturer.
Change keeps up demand for the product (research, news, theory, and technology). Post-
Industrialism, a knowledge elite, and accelerated social change appear to go hand in hand.

## [208]
The  managerial elite therefore could not  entirely reject
environmentalism and  relativism, or  their  embodiment in scientism,
melioristic and utopian formulas, and a hedonistic and cosmopolitan ethic,
because these ideas offered  rationalizations for  continuing  social
engineering implemented by mass organizations and their managerial elites,
and  for  the  power and  rewards that  these  elites  acquired through these
functions.
The  consensus version of  managerial liberalism therefore did  not
actually abandon or reject the premises and implications of progressivist
liberalism but  simply submerged  them. It  tacitly incorporated these
premises and values into the “consensus” that it identified as the public
orthodoxy of American society, dissent from which constituted “extremism”
of the left or right, and this consensus legitimized the implementation of
social reconstruction by an incumbent managerial elite rather in opposition
to bourgeois incumbents. Thus Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., though he sought to
dissociate liberal thought from  unwarranted optimism and  faith  in
perfectibility, nevertheless reaffirmed the need for continuing social change.
“The reform of institutions becomes an indispensable part of the enterprise
of democracy,” he wrote, and
Given human imperfection, society will continue imperfect. Problems will always torment
us, because all important problems are insoluble; that is why they are important. The good
comes from the continuing struggle to try and solve them, not from the vain hope of their
solution.
## [209]
Despite its  disclaimers of  “a  picture of  man  as  perfectible,”
Schlesinger’s The Vital Center, which has been called the “manifesto of
postwar liberalism,”
## [210]
nevertheless expressed the author’s certainty “that
history has equipped modern American liberalism with the ideas and the

knowledge to  construct a  society where men  will  be  both  happy and
free.”
## [211]
In an introduction to a 1962 edition, Schlesinger again juxtaposed
his denial of liberal utopianism and environmentalism with affirmation of a
faith in something approaching them:
No one would argue that steering more resources into the public sector would cure the
spiritual ailments of  the  affluent society; but  it  seems possible that  the  resulting
improvements in  opportunities in  education,  medical care,  social  welfare, community
planning, culture and the arts will improve the chances for the individual to win his own
spiritual fulfillment.
## [212]
Indeed, Schlesinger’s advocacy of “an impending shift from quantitative
to  qualitative liberalism”
## [213]
anticipated  and  laid  the  ideological
groundwork for managerial design and reconstruction of the social order in
addition to the economy that characterized the liberalism of the 1960s and
## 1970s.
Consensus liberalism, then,  despite its  qualification of  progressivist
beliefs, nevertheless provided a ground for continuing social reconstruction
(“the  continuing  struggle”) and  the  design of  social change by  the
managerial elite, and, in declining to define a final goal or standard of social
amelioration, it provided grounds for an endless process of reconstruction.
It legitimized the managerial regime by evolving as a test of legitimacy the
extent to which the regime continued to be committed to and involved in
encouraging, designing, and managing social change. It therefore was able
to  retain  as  articles of  faith  or  unquestioned and  usually unspoken
assumptions its radical premises but also to legitimize and stabilize the elite
and its regime, which, on the basis of this ideology, was able to consolidate
its power and at the same time continue the process of social reconstruction
that  its  interests also  demanded.  Consensus liberalism thus  allowed the
ideals and the process of social reconstruction to be institutionalized or
assimilated into the very structure of the managerial regime. The exponents

of liberal ideology, without emphasizing these ideals and values or their
premises, could  revive them when the  establishment  required
rationalizations for the acceleration of change, as it did in the 1960s with
the War on Poverty, the attack on racial discrimination, and the rise of the
## New Left.
The resurgence of liberal and left-wing ideologies in the 1960s was in
reality an effort to resume and carry forward the imperatives of the regime
for the acceleration of change and social reconstruction, and not, despite a
certain amount of anti-managerial rhetoric, a revolt against the regime. In
the ideology of the “New Left,” all the environmentalist premises of the
liberal thought of the early part of the century were revived, especially in
regard to racial, sexual, economic, and social issues, and incorporated in
Marxist  or  semi-Marxist  ideological vehicles. The  New  Left  and  the
counter-culture did not seriously threaten the managerial regime and in fact
were soon absorbed by it. Counter-cultural and “Dionysian” encouragement
of hedonism merely reflected the dynamics of managerial capitalism, which
assimilated, profited from, and domesticated the counter-culture in the form
of new (and expensive) fashions and forms of leisure and entertainment.
New Left criticism of the Vietnam War and anti-communist policies of the
Cold War corresponded to corporate objections to economic dislocations
caused by  the  war  and  to  corporate interests in  converging  toward and
expanding trade with the Soviet, East European, and Chinese markets.
## [214]

Liberal and  radical opposition to  racial  discrimination in  the  South  and
elsewhere corresponded to the political needs of the managerial state to
eliminate resistance from  anti-managerial power centers and  movements
and to secure in the newly enfranchised black electorate a mass political
base for the revived Caesarist presidency of John Kennedy and Lyndon
Johnson. The revival of hedonistic and cosmopolitan themes and values

corresponded to the needs of the mass organizations in the state, economy,
and  culture  and  communication to  homogenize and  discipline  the  mass
population through uniform mass communications and entertainment, the
stimulation of  mass  consumption,  and  the  political goals  of  social
reconstruction.
The  resurgence of  radical progressivist ideology in  the  1960s thus
represented a further adaptation of liberalism to the changing needs and
interests of the managerial regime, which was impelled by the appearance
of new technological, economic, organizational, political, and demographic
forces to abandon the ideology of consensus that had served as its principal
support since the end of World War II, to accelerate its management of
social innovation, and  to  adopt more  aggressive and  confrontational
formulas that  could  accommodate  the  new  forces and  a  resumption of
acceleration. New Left ideology and its critique of consensus or corporate
liberalism offered a source for the adaptation, and its critique of consensus
liberalism was compatible with the needs of the managerial regime. The
adherents of  the  New  Left  and  the  counter-culture were  not,  of  course,
conscious agents of  the  managerial regime, but  many  of  their  principal
ideas and values were congruent with advancing the interests and functions
of the regime and constituted no threat to it. Those ideas that were threats or
were not congruent with managerial interests were eventually ignored or
were reformulated into forms of expression compatible with the regime and
were assimilated into it.
The adaptation of 20th-century liberalism to the needs and interests of
the managerial elite in state, economy, and culture was not, for the most
part, the result of a design on the part of the exponents of liberal thought in
the early part of the century. Indeed, in its original goals and purposes, what

became managerial liberalism was often concerned to limit the scale and
power of business enterprise, to make government more responsible and
more honest, and in general to assert and restore Jeffersonian and bourgeois
values and institutions. The Progressive movement exerted an appeal to the
small  businessmen  and  small  farmers, the  middle classes of  American
society,  who  perceived and  reacted  against the  corruption, power,  and
decadence presented by the immense business conglomerates and political
machines of the late bourgeois era. The excesses of the era were the result
in part of the successes of entrepreneurial capitalism and in part of the
natural greed and ambition of its elite, but they also were partially an effort
by the bourgeois elite to control and discipline the revolution of mass and
scale by traditional bourgeois methods. The Robber Barons and bosses of
the Gilded Era were not modern managers; they had no special technical
training or  knowledge, and  they  controlled their  business and  financial
empires and their political apparatuses through their own personal skill and
efforts and through personal, community, ethnic, or kinship bonds among
their  associates and  followers.  These methods could  not  work,  if  only
because the personal skills involved could not be transmitted to successors
and were in any case too clumsy when applied to huge masses of voters,
workers, business subordinates, customers, and politicians. Nor were the
corrupting and degrading results of the methods palatable or acceptable to
the mainstream of the bourgeois order.
That this effort to accommodate the revolution of mass and scale by
traditional bourgeois methods did not succeed and that it only aggravated
the social pathology of the era was the insight of the proto-liberalism of the
Populists and early Progressives. That the new masses and the new scale of
human activities could  not  be  disciplined by  bourgeois  institutions and
ideologies and could be controlled only by new organizations, a new elite,

and a new ideology that rejected bourgeois values and ideas—and that this
system of control involved a new vision of man, society, and the universe—
were  the  claims and  insights articulated by  the  academics, journalists,
philosophers, social scientists, and  business and  political leaders who
formulated and  developed managerial liberalism. In  the  process of  its
formulation and development, managerial liberalism came to express and
rationalize the social, economic, and political interests of the new elites that
emerged. The emphasis that Progressive “New Nationalists” such as Croly,
Theodore Roosevelt, and later Berle and Means and the New Deal Brain
Trust placed on the integration of the mass corporation and the mass state
became the heart of managerial liberalism. Fusion of state and economy
provided rewards for managerial corporations and their elites by allowing
them  competitive advantages over  smaller entrepreneurial firms  and
permitting the  regulation of  the  economy in  their  interests. The
environmentalist premises of liberal theory challenged bourgeois values and
institutions and rationalized the social and economic engineering managed
and enforced by the central government and designed by the managerial
intelligentsia in  the  mass  organizations of  culture and  communication.
Environmentalism and  relativism also  served to  unify  these  needs  and
interests in  a  reasonably coherent but  also  conveniently vague and
adaptable theoretical framework. Liberalism could accommodate itself to
the  changing needs  of  the  managerial regime by  emphasizing  some
elements of its formal ideology and neglecting other elements, and any part
of liberal doctrine could be resuscitated to defend managerial interests when
necessary. While the exponents of liberalism often dissented from specific
functions and policies of the managerial regime, the mainstream of 20th-
century liberalism has generally proved a valuable ideological defense for
the  interests of  the  managerial elite  and  the  regime of  fused  mass

organizations it  has  constructed. The  conscription and  adaptation of  the
formal content of liberal ideology to the interests and needs of the regime
was the result not of the purposes or the designs of those intellectuals who
formulated this content but rather of a process of evolution in response to
the needs of those groups that gained power and social rewards from the
structures and functions with which liberal thought was congruent.

The Ideological Functions of Managerial
## Liberalism
Liberalism in the 20th century has functioned as a species of managerial
humanism and in one version or another is the dominant and most common
managerial ideology in the United States and in the other soft managerial
regimes of the Western world. It has successfully performed most of the
functions associated with the ideologies of elites. It has rationalized the
interests of the managerial elite in terms of ideals (progress, scientific truth,
social justice, liberation, equality) that effectively disguise the interests that
are  protected. It  has  also  identified these  interests in  the  form  of  an
ideological code that accepts the enlargement of mass organizations and the
fulfillment of their functional imperatives in state, economy, and culture as
inevitable or  desirable for  social progress, and  it  communicates these
interests by means of its codes to members of the elites that manage these
organizations and  thereby tends  to  unify  them  by  imparting a  common
consciousness of  their  shared interests. Finally,  liberalism seeks to
legitimize the  regime and  integrate mass  society within it  by  providing
moral and emotional values, images, symbols, rhetoric, martyrs, and heroes
that  attempt to  manipulate the  sentiments of  the  subordinate mass
population outside the elite and to wed them to the regime.
Liberalism, however,  does  not  perform this  integrative function as
effectively as  it  does  its  other  ideological services. Although  the  mass
organizations of culture and communication are fused with the mass state
and  the  corporations,  the  managerial intelligentsia has  not  been  able  to
eradicate or completely discredit rival ideologies, particularly the persistent

bourgeois intellectual and moral codes. It has not been able to do so mainly
because the soft managerial regime that it rationalizes is unable to use force
effectively to suppress resistance, challenges, and rival ideas and values or
to  formulate rationalizations for  an  enduring consolidation of  the
subordinate strata  in  a  common social and  political identity that  is
ideologically compatible with liberal cosmopolitan and hedonistic ideas and
values. The use of force and the assertion and enforcement of a public
orthodoxy by  the  managerial regime contradicts the  relativist and
environmentalist premises of liberalism, the hedonistic and cosmopolitan
values and modes of behavior that the regime seeks to promote, and the
tolerance, pluralism, and “open society” on which it depends; and reliance
on force to any great extent to integrate mass society would contradict and
threaten the whole structure and functioning of the mass economy, mass
political system, and mass cultural apparatus. Moreover, the psychological
type or personality that is dominant in the managerial elite recoils from the
use  of  force  and  is  unable to  make  prolonged or  consistent  use  of  it
effectively.
The soft managerial regime depends upon manipulation of the masses to
undermine the bourgeois  order  and  to  acquire and  retain  power.  The
disciplines it uses are not those of force and the ideological, emotional, and
moral correlates of  force  but  the  manipulative disciplines  of  mass
consumption, mass  politics, and  the  mass  mythology of hedonism and
cosmopolitanism  and  their  relativist premises generated by  the
organizations of culture and communication. While the encouragement of
consumption and  indulgence, the  pursuit of  pleasure, the  avoidance of
sacrifice, the myth of a sensual utopia, and the dispersion of group loyalties
and identities function as disciplines in the soft managerial regime, they are
disciplines that have inherent limitations and inefficiencies. Thus, just as

there are limits to the openness and pluralism of the soft managerial regime,
so there is a limit to the adaptability of its ideological system and to the
modifications of the manipulative techniques and style of dominance on
which the regime depends. Their limitations are reflected in the ideology
that rationalizes the soft regime. Eric Goldman noted the tensions, if not the
outright contradiction, that arose from the relativism that thinkers like Boas,
the pragmatists William James and John Dewey, the “Reform Darwinists,”
and others associated with the new liberalism articulated:
Relativism encourages  the  most  blatant kind  of  self-aggrandizing politics; if  all  ideas
reflect economic interests, why not advocate the program that most directly serves yourself
or your group? [ . . . ] A special feature of Reform Darwinian relativism produced its own
special danger. By heavily emphasizing environment as the factor that makes men what
they are, Reform Darwinism opened the way to using the environment as an excuse for
any  failure  of  ability or  will  power.  Eat,  drink,  and  be  anti-social, for  tomorrow the
environment explains us.
## [215]
While relativism is useful for the rationalization of the hedonistic and
cosmopolitan ethic necessary for the stimulation of mass consumption, the
homogenization of mass society, and the dispersion of bourgeois loyalties
and values, the incorporation of relativist premises in the ideology of the
regime and the painless and comfortable disciplines that the regime uses to
maintain its power prevent the managerial elite from making extensive use
of force and from appealing to ideas, emotions, and moral values that would
rationalize force and its consequences—loyalty to and solidarity with the
group, the endurance of pain and suffering, the acceptance of sacrifice, and
the postponement of gratification. Nor is the dependence of the soft regime
on  continuous manipulative social  innovation and  reconstruction or  the
cosmopolitan and hedonistic values that legitimize this function compatible
with the articulation of ideologies that rationalize a firm collective identity
and solidarity. To the extent that the managerial elite believes in and is
influenced by its own ideology, its premises and ethic offer rationalizations

for irresolution, the avoidance of force and its correlates, and the dispersion
of the social and ideological basis of a collective solidarity. The disciplines
of the soft managerial regime thus tend to undermine themselves, and they
introduce a long-term vulnerability into the regime that it cannot easily
overcome and becomes blatant when societal emergencies and breakdowns
such as war, terrorism, crime, riots, economic crises, and internal violent
and  coercive challenges to  the  regime necessitate the  suspension or
modification of the hedonistic and cosmopolitan ethic and the assertion of
collective solidarity, the acceptance of sacrifice, the rationing of resources,
the use of lethal force, and the marshaling of will, loyalty, and endurance. It
may  be  that  this  vulnerability  will  eventually incapacitate and  destroy
managerial society, which will be unable to command the sacrifices and
loyalties necessary to meet such challenges, or it may be that more severe
disciplines will  replace soft  ones,  and  the  soft  managerial regimes will
evolve into hard regimes. In its present form, however, the soft managerial
regime is unable to use coercion to integrate mass society fully under its
power or to articulate formulas that rationalize, reinforce, and correspond to
the sentiments of collective solidarity and identity in the subordinate mass
population, and  the  manipulative disciplines on  which it  depends are
insufficient to eliminate completely these sentiments or the anti-managerial
forces and ideologies that incorporate them.
The limitations and vulnerabilities of the soft managerial regime thus
generate problems in imposing its ideology on mass society and integrating
its  power over  the  mass  population. The  regime must  use  non-coercive
forms of  discipline to  impose  its  ideology,  and  it  does  so  through
manipulative techniques, material inducement by the state and economy,
propaganda, and  reliance on  the  technical, administrative, and
communicational skills  that  characterize its  elite.  Although the  mass

population often shares loyalties to and sometimes venerates the symbols
offered  by  liberalism, even  the  material rewards conferred  by  the
managerial economy and state, the control of the mass organizations of
culture and communication, and the full employment of all the technical
and verbal skills of the elite have not eliminated anti-managerial and anti-
liberal impulses. The resurgence of such impulses in the interstices of the
managerial regime, particularly their adoption of force themselves, is the
most profound fear of, and the most important threat to, the elite and its
apparatus of power.

## THE DYNAMICS OF THE
## MANAGERIAL REGIME: SOFT
## AND HARD MANAGERIALISM
OceanofPDF.com

The Dynamics of Ruling Elites
Ruling elites come into being when certain groups in society are able to
control social forces—sources of wealth, technologies, weapons systems,
myths that  command mass  loyalties, bodies of  knowledge, or  forms  of
political, economic, and social organization, for example—that yield power,
the ability to elicit obedience from the mass population and to make the
interests of the elite prevail over the interests of other groups. The social
forces that constitute the basis of an elite determine its dynamics, the ways
in which the elite pursues its interests, acquires and maintains its power, and
responds to challenges to its dominance. An elite that rests on the control of
certain kinds  of  weaponry—iron  weapons, the  longbow,  or  artillery,  for
example—will differ in its dynamics from one that rests on the control of
sources of wealth—agriculture, oceanic commerce, or industrial production.
Although most elites rely on one social force as the principal source of their
power, few elites rest exclusively on the control of a single social force, and
usually an elite combines its control of several different social forces in an
institutional apparatus that constitutes its regime, its system of power. A
variety of social forces in an elite often creates conflicts between groups
that particularly depend on some of them more than on others, and such
conflict tends  to  bring  into  the  elite  a  multiplicity of  resources, ideas,
values, skills,  and  talents that  balance and  complement each  other  and
contribute to the ability of the elite as a whole to consolidate power and
respond successfully to challenges—internal as well as external, material as
well as non-material. In some cases a single social force, and those groups
attached to it, will become so powerful and pervasive that it is able to
exclude others from the elite and to monopolize power and its rewards.
Internal conflicts  are  then  severely reduced or  eliminated, and  the  elite

displays little versatility in responding to challenges. Such contraction or
narrowing of  the  elite  ultimately jeopardizes its  ability to  maintain its
power, since forces eventually arise that are able to challenge the elite in
ways to which it is not prepared to respond because of the narrow range of
resources and skills at its disposal.
The managerial elites that emerged in the course of the revolution of
mass  and  scale  formed themselves around the  social force  of  mass
organizations and the new science and techniques of management by which
mass organizations are controlled. The interests of the new elites involved
expanding the need for and the rewards of their skills and functions and
therefore the  continuing expansion of  mass  organizations. Since the
bourgeois order, from which mass organizations and their elites emerged,
was  based  on  smaller,  simpler organizations that  had  little  need  for
managerial skills, the interests of the new elites brought them into conflict
with bourgeois society and the elites that ruled it, and this conflict took the
form of efforts by the managerial class to replace the economic and political
organizations and the intellectual and moral beliefs of the bourgeois order
with its own organizations and ideologies.
Two  kinds  of  managerial regime emerged  in  the  course of  the  20th
century. Although the elites of both types of regime are managerial, in that
they both depend upon the performance of managerial functions in mass
organizations, and both are opposed to bourgeois society and its ideologies
and institutions, there are important differences between the elites of these
regimes that result in important differences in the ideologies and patterns of
behavior that are associated with them. In the one type—the soft managerial
regime that prevails in the Western world—the elite depends mainly upon
manipulation of the mass population by means of managerial skills to retain

power. The ideologies of the soft managerial regimes reflect this reliance on
manipulation in their emphasis on hedonistic and cosmopolitan values and
ideas, the promotion of which enable the elite to homogenize the tastes and
values of the mass population and to discipline it with mass consumption,
leisure, and  entertainment—managerial or  “post-industrial” versions of
panem et circenses. The behavior and policies of the soft managerial elites
incline toward resolving problems and  challenges by  means of
manipulation, recognizing only those problems and challenges that can be
resolved through manipulation, re-defining problems and  challenges in
terms  that  are  susceptible to  manipulation, and  ignoring or  failing to
recognize problems and  challenges that  cannot be  resolved by
manipulation. Because the elite depends so much on manipulation, the mass
organizations of  culture and  communication, which perform  their
disciplinary and  integrative functions principally through verbal and
psychic manipulation, become unusually important instruments of power in
the soft managerial regime.
In the other type, the hard managerial regime, which has prevailed in the
Soviet Union and  until  recently the  other  communist states  of  Eastern
Europe and once prevailed in Germany under National Socialism, the elite
depends mainly upon force or coercion of the mass population by means of
managerial skills applied to the instruments of force (principally the armed
services and police forces).
## [216]
Their ideologies reflect their reliance on
force  in  their  emphasis on  ascetic values or  a  “sacrifice ethic”  and  on
“solidarism”—ideas and values that emphasize group solidarity. They avoid
and  condemn hedonism and cosmopolitanism. Through the  emphasis of
their  ideologies,  the  hard  managerial elites  seek  to  discipline the  mass
population by inducing it to accept and take part in the use of force and to
accept sacrifice and postponement of gratification for the sake of the group

—the party, Volk, or “Fatherland.” In their behavior and policies, the hard
managerial elites  tend  toward resolving all  problems and  challenges by
means of force, recognizing only those problems and challenges that can be
resolved through force, re-defining problems and challenges in terms that
are susceptible to solution by force, and ignoring or failing to recognize
problems and challenges that cannot be so resolved. Although the mass
organizations of culture and communication are important instruments of
power in all mass societies, they are less important in the hard managerial
regimes than the instruments of force and also less important than in the
soft managerial regimes.
The tendency in both the hard and soft managerial regimes has been for
managerial forces to pervade all areas of political, economic, social, and
intellectual life,  to  exclude non-managerial forces from  power,  and  to
monopolize power and its rewards. In the hard managerial regimes this
tendency triumphed almost completely, and non- or anti-managerial forces
were ruthlessly and coercively suppressed. In the soft managerial regimes
the  managerial elites  were  unable to  eliminate anti-managerial forces
completely from the elite. Anti-managerial (principally bourgeois) forces
retained sufficient influence, wealth, status, and ideological credibility to
resist managerial power, but not enough to constitute an elite in their own
right or to displace the managerial elite. Ultimately the monopolizing and
exclusionary tendencies of  managerial society,  its  proclivity to  rely
exclusively on either coercion or manipulation, may constitute a serious
vulnerability of the managerial regime, whether it is hard or soft, since the
result of these tendencies is to narrow the range of resources available to the
elite for meeting societal challenges.
Both the hard and soft managerial elites are formed around the social

forces of  mass  organizations and  the  science and  techniques of
management, and  they  share  a  common interest in  preserving and
expanding mass  organizations, in  increasing the  rewards and  power
available to those who perform managerial functions, and in challenging
and overcoming older established elites and their social orders. It is not
immediately apparent why  elites  that  are  formed around essentially the
same social forces and share many of the same interests should tend to rely
on quite different methods of pursuing their interests and exhibit different
characteristic ideologies and patterns of behavior. However, the reliance on
coercion or manipulation not only as political tactics and methods but also
as ideological themes and indeed their appearance in the general patterns of
behavior and even in the processes of thought that distinguish the two kinds
of elites suggest that psychological or subrational factors may ultimately
account for  the  tendencies of  the  two  kinds  of  elites  to  use  force  or
manipulation respectively.  The  different  circumstances under  which the
hard  and  soft  elites  emerged  may  have  tended to  select  a  certain
psychological type, or cluster of psychological traits, as prevalent in the
hard managerial elite and another psychological type as prevalent in the soft
elite. Such psychological types must be counted as additional social forces
that distinguish the composition of the two different kinds of managerial
elites and  contribute to  determining their  different dynamics. The
correlation of psychological or subrational factors with different kinds of
ruling elites was the central part of the sociology of Vilfredo Pareto, who,
with Gaetano Mosca, formulated the classical theory of elites in the late
19th and early 20th centuries.
OceanofPDF.com

Pareto’s Psychology of Elites
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, while the revolution of mass
and scale was underway, the Italian sociologist Vilfredo Pareto developed a
general theory of elites and the psychological traits associated with them
that seems to apply to the differences in behavior and mentality between the
two  different kinds  of  managerial elite  and  also  to  the  behavior and
mentality of the elites of the bourgeois and prescriptive orders that preceded
managerial society. While Pareto’s theory leaves much to be desired from
the  standpoint of  modern social science in  methodology,  empirical
verification, and  conceptual rigor,  more recent psychological and
sociological theories resemble some of Pareto’s ideas. Despite the problems
of Pareto’s theory, it remains useful in its application to the behavioral and
mental patterns of the managerial elite, and, if it cannot be applied too
rigorously to social and historical phenomena, its general conclusions serve
to explain and clarify the psychological types that prevail in the managerial
elites of modern mass society.
Pareto held that the variations of human behavior throughout history
could be analyzed in terms of underlying mental and behavioral instincts or
uniformities that he called “residues”—that is, what is left over or what
remains after the variations have been stripped away. He distinguished six
kinds or classes of residues, though he elaborated his theory of elites largely
in  terms  of  only  two  of  them. Although all  human beings possess and
display all six classes of residues to some degree, some classes are more
concentrated or predominant in some human beings than in others. Thus,
human beings and their behavior—social, economic, and political as well as

intellectual and verbal behavior—may be categorized as different types in
which a particular class of residue is more influential than the other classes.
The two classes of residues that Pareto emphasized are what he called
Class I, the “instinct for combinations,” and Class II, the instinct for “group
persistence” or “the persistence of aggregates.” These two kinds of residues
give  rise  to  distinctive behavioral and  mental patterns that  appear to
conform to the types that are predominant in the two types of managerial
elite and in prescriptive and bourgeois elites as well, although it is probable
that  the  bourgeois  elite  displayed  a  mixture of  the  two  classes. Pareto
perceived and discussed the early stages of the revolution of mass and scale
and some aspects of the social and political transformation that it involved,
though he  did  not  perceive it  in  terms  of  the  theory of  the  managerial
revolution or as a conflict between the managerial and bourgeois elites.
The residues of Class I, the “instinct for combinations,” constitute “an
inclination to combine certain things with certain other things,”
## [217]
or, as
S.E.   Finer has described it, “the propensity to take disparate elements out of
their familiar contexts and unite them together in new combinations.”
## [218]
This inclination or propensity may take logical and experimental forms, as
in science, which combines different phenomena according to the rules of
scientific method, or it may manifest itself in non-rational behavior such as
magic, superstition, and folklore, which irrationally or arbitrarily combine
different phenomena. Those persons in whom the instinct for combinations
is prevalent will tend to be innovative and to seek new ways of combining,
synthesizing, and  relating different phenomena in  their  thought and
activities. In social and economic behavior, persons with a high degree of
Class I residues “are in general . . . adventurous souls, hungry for novelty in
the economic as well as in the social field, and not at all alarmed at change,

expecting as they do to take advantage of it.”
## [219]
Intellectually, persons with
a high concentration of Class I residues tend toward skepticism and other
ideologies that have the effect of “undermining the edifice of ‘prejudice’.”
In the mid 19th century, according to Pareto, positivism, free-thinking, and
“the ensign of the goddess Science” were dominant intellectual trends that
revealed the prevalence of Class I residues in the intellectual elites of that
era, and he believed that “if we consider modern life as a whole, we may
safely conclude  that  Class  I  residues and  the  conclusions of  logico-
experimental science have enlarged the field of their dominion.”
## [220]
Class  I  residues have  very  significant manifestations in  the  political
behavior of the individuals in whom they prevail and in the elites that such
individuals form. These persons tend to be averse to the use of force and to
rely on various forms of intelligence and cunning (deception, persuasion,
manipulation) in the pursuit and retention of power,
for the combination-residues supply, precisely, the artistry and resourcefulness required for
evolving ingenious expedients as  substitutes for  open  resistance. .  .  .  Policies of  the
governing class [of Class I residues] are not planned too far ahead in time. Predominance
of the combination instincts . . . result[s] in making the governing class more satisfied with
the present and less thoughtful of the future. The individual comes to prevail, and by far,
over family, community, nation. Material interests and interests of the present or a near
future come to prevail over the ideal interests of community or nation and interests of the
distant future. The  impulse is  to  enjoy  the  present without too  much  thought for  the
morrow.
## [221]
In  general,  then,  the  mental and  behavioral patterns that  the  Class  I
residues manifest tend to be those that display an affinity for synthesizing or
organizing disparate ideas, values, and experiences, that are comfortable
with  and  contribute to  social and  intellectual innovation, that  tend  to
suspend or  avoid  firm  moral  judgments and  prejudices and  lack  strong
feelings toward moral and social bonds, that have an aversion to the use of
force,  violence, and  physical conflict and  a  preference for  reliance on

intelligence and cunning in the resolution of conflicts and problems.
The residues of Class II, the instinct for “group persistence” or “the
persistence of aggregates,” are reflected in behavioral and mental patterns
quite  different  from  those  of  Class  I  residues. Once  a  combination of
disparate elements has been formed under the influence of the instinct for
combinations, “an  instinct very  often  comes into  play  that  tends  with
varying energy to prevent the things so combined from being disjoined. . . .
This instinct may be compared roughly to mechanical inertia: it tends to
resist the movement imparted by other instincts.”
## [222]
If Class I residues tend
to  promote  innovative behavior,  those  of  Class  II  generally tend  to
encourage a conservative behavior and mentality. Persons in whom Class II
residues are dominant form enduring relationships with and attachments to
other individuals, family, community, place, class, and nation. In economic
behavior Class II residues lead to caution and reliance on safe investments
rather than adventure and risk-taking. Persons who live on their savings and
interest from  property (rentiers  in  Pareto’s  terminology,  as  opposed to
speculators, in whose economic behavior Class I residues are dominant)
exhibit a high concentration of Class II residues. They “are often quiet,
timorous souls sitting at all times with their ears cocked in apprehension,
like rabbits, and hoping little and fearing much from any change, for well
they know of bitter experience that they will be called upon to foot the bill
for it.”
## [223]
Intellectually, those in whom Class II residues are prevalent tend
to espouse ideas that emphasize faith, endurance, acceptance of traditional
beliefs and  prejudices, and  group solidarity.  Pareto saw  traditional
Catholicism, nationalism, and  imperialism as  such  “derivations” of  the
Class II residues, but also socialism in so far as it emphasized the solidarity
of the working class and its struggle against other classes.

Although, in Pareto’s  view,  Class  II  residues  are  almost always
dominant in any mass or subject population, those in whom they prevail can
also form an elite. In the governments established by those in whom Class
II residues prevail,
Class-circulation is generally slow. They are not expensive governments. On the other
hand they fail to stimulate economic production, whether because they are conservative by
temperament, recoiling from new enterprise, or because they put no premiums in class-
circulation on individuals distinguished by instincts for economic combinations. . . . [T]he
ideal of governments of that type is a nation that is crystallized in its institutions. [ . . . ]
They may grow wealthy through conquest . . . but since no new wealth is produced in that
manner, the prosperity is increasingly precarious. . . . Furthermore, in times past, such
regimes have  tended to  degenerate into  government by  armed mobs  (praetorians,
janissaries), which can do nothing but squander wealth.
## [224]
Elites in which Class II residues are concentrated tend to rely on force
rather  than  on  intelligence and  cunning. These  residues, in  S.E.   Finer’s
words, “resist innovation, and seek to preserve old forms and traditions.”
They are aggressive, authoritarian, reliant on force and threats of force, and contemptuous
of manoeuvre, persuasion and compromise. They give rise to ideals, and are embodied in
religions whether supernatural or  secular,  among the  last  being  such  religions as
nationalism, socialism, imperialism. The goals are set for a distant future. Self-sacrifice for
the community and the future, the subordination of the individual’s interest to both of
these, courage and persistence in striving for them—these also are the characteristics of the
Class II residues.
## [225]
Class I and Class II residues are therefore radically different in the kinds
of behavior that they instigate. Because of these differences, and because
both  classes of  residues and  their  associated behavioral patterns exhibit
vulnerabilities that  weaken the  rule  of  the  elites  in  which they  are
concentrated, there is throughout history a cycle of elites and the residues
that prevail in them. Elites in which Class I residues are concentrated seek
to avoid the use of force by relying on intelligence and cunning. The more
they do so, however, the more they tend to exclude Class II residues from
the elite, and the latter begin to accumulate in the subject classes of the
population:

To prevent or resist violence, the governing class resorts to “diplomacy,” fraud, corruption
—governmental authority passes, in a word, from the lions to the foxes. The governing
class bows its head under the threat of violence, but it surrenders only in appearances,
trying to turn the flank of the obstacle it cannot demolish in frontal attack. In the long run
that sort of procedure comes to exercise a far-reaching influence on the selection of the
governing class,  which is  now  recruited  only  from  the  foxes, while  the  lions  are
blackballed.
## [226]
The exclusion of the “lions” or Class II residues from the elite and the
increasing predominance of “foxes” or Class I residues create an imbalance
that ultimately destabilizes the rule of the elite.
[I]n  the  long  run  the  differences in  temperament become gradually accentuated,  the
combination instincts tending to predominate in the ruling class, and instincts of group-
persistence in  the  subject class.  When  that  difference becomes sufficiently great,
revolution occurs. . . . Revolution often transfers power to a new governing class, which
exhibits a reinforcement in its instincts of group-persistence and so adds to its designs of
present enjoyments aspirations towards ideal enjoyments presumably attainable at some
future time—scepticism in part gives way to faith.
## [227]
Human history,  for  Pareto, is  “a  graveyard of  aristocracies”
## [228]
and
oscillates between the rule of elites in which Class I residues prevail and the
rule  of  those  in  which Class  II  residues predominate. Because of  the
differing  residues concentrated in  different  elites  and  the  differences in
behavior and thought that the residues cause, the continuing circulation of
elites throughout history is a process that gives rise to different patterns of
political, social, and economic behavior on the part of different elites and to
different ideas, values, and institutions that the elites formulate and try to
impose.
## [229]
The circulation of elites, then, in Pareto’s theory, is in fact a
process of civilizational revolution.
The  scientific grounds of  Pareto’s  typology are  not  very  clear.  He
conducted no systematic or empirical research to verify the existence of
“residues” or of the various classes into which he categorized them, and his
use of the terms and concepts of his theory are often vague or contradictory.
It would be a mistake to carry his psychological types too far or to apply

them too literally. Yet the recognition of two distinct psychological types—
one  that  is  innovative, cunning, and  sometimes treacherous; the  other,
stolid, forceful or violent, usually loyal, and sometimes brutal—is a theme
in world mythology and is frequently accepted by many people as a matter
of  common sense. S.E.   Finer  suggests that  a  better  term  for  “Class I
residues” might be “the Ulysses complex,” and “trickster” figures (Coyote
in Amerindian folklore, Loki, Till Eulenspiegel, Hermes, Br’er Rabbit) are
common in many mythologies, as are Class II-type figures (Heracles or
Samson, for example). It is not uncommon in mythology for the Class II
figures to meet their doom from the trickery of Class I types, a theme that is
suggestive of  Pareto’s  model of  the  circulation of  elites.  Whatever the
scientific value  of  his  theory of  residues, then,  Pareto seems to  have
perceived an important truth about human psychology and its relationship
to power, a truth also noted by Niccolò Machiavelli, from whom Pareto
derived the distinction between lions and foxes.
Some rulers, whether individual leaders or elites, tend to rely on force
and the institutions, ideas, values, and emotions associated with force, while
others tend  to  rely  on  what  may  generally be  called “manipulation”
(persuasion, deception, compromise, bargaining, negotiations,  bribery,
corruption, assimilation, co-option, etc.)    and  which typically involves a
high  degree of  intelligence or  cunning.
## [230]
The  perfect ruler,  in
Machiavelli’s view, would be the one who is able to use both force and
manipulation, to be both a lion and a fox, as necessary; but Machiavelli
recognized that the ability to do so was rare, that rulers generally depend on
one or the other too much, and that such an unbalanced dependence on
either force or manipulation represents a serious weakness of their rule.
Dependence on force or on manipulation may be a result in part of the
material resources at the disposal of a ruler or of circumstances that cannot

be entirely avoided or controlled, but, though Machiavelli did not formulate
a  psychological theory,  he  saw  that  dependence on  either force  or
manipulation was also often a result of the mental habits of a ruler, of his
psychological type or character. Pareto’s own psychological theory of elites
is,  in  many  respects, merely a  more  complicated effort  to  generalize
Machiavelli’s perception and to extend the idea of lions and foxes among
human beings from individual rulers to elites in society.
Despite the  deficiencies of  Pareto’s  theory of  residues, there  are
similarities between the Class I and Class II types of his theory and the
character structure described by some modern sociologists. Class II types
are strongly reminiscent of David Riesman’s “tradition directed” character,
who “learns to understand and appreciate patterns which have endured for
centuries,” and  whose activity “is  determined by  characterologically
grounded obedience to  tradition.”
## [231]
Class  I  types,  on  the  other  hand,
resemble Riesman’s  “other-directed” people, for  whom “their
contemporaries are the source of direction for the individual. . . . The goals
toward which the other-directed person strives shift . . . [I]t is only the
process of striving itself and the process of paying close attention to the
signals from others that remain unaltered throughout life.”
## [232]
The other-
directed character, like Pareto’s Class I type, must possess an affinity for
making combinations, “an inclination to combine certain things with certain
other  things” (Pareto), in  order  to  sort  out,  internalize, and  pay  close
attention to the many different signals that he receives from contemporaries
in peer groups and the mass media and by which he orients himself, his
ideas, and his behavior. It is significant that Riesman suggested that fifth-
century Athens exhibited “the rise of social forms that seem to indicate the
presence of the other-directed mode of conformity,” and that Pareto saw in
Athens “from the war with the Medes [490 B.C.] down to the battle of

Chaeronea [338 B.C.] . . . a period in which . . . the ruling class shows a
great abundance of Class I residues.”
## [233]
Riesman also noted,
If we wanted to cast our social character types into social class molds, we could say that
inner-direction is  the  typical character of  the  “old”  middle class—the banker,  the
tradesman, the small entrepreneur, the technically oriented engineer, etc.—while other-
direction is becoming the typical character of the “new” middle class—the bureaucrat, the
salaried employee in business, etc. Many of the economic factors associated with the
recent growth of the “new” middle class are well known. They have been discussed by
James Burnham, Colin Clark, Peter Drucker, and others.
## [234]
Although Riesman’s “tradition-directed” and “other-directed” characters
are  not  identical to  Pareto’s  Class  II  and  Class  I  residues, and  though
Riesman’s social and psychological theory is quite different from that of
Pareto, there is clearly an overlap between the types delineated. Moreover,
Pareto’s Class II residues and Riesman’s tradition-direction both correlate
with the character or psychological type exhibited by the prescriptive elites
of many pre-bourgeois, tribal, medieval, and early modern societies, as well
as  with  those  of  the  hard  managerial regimes, while  Riesman’s  other-
directed character, corresponding to Pareto’s Class I residues, conforms to
the  psychological type  exhibited  by  the  soft  managerial elites  of  mass
society.
## [235]
Riesman’s “inner-directed” character does not correspond to a
type described by Pareto but conforms to the mixed psychological types
exhibited by the bourgeois elite of the 19th century.
The personality type identified by Christopher Lasch as “narcissistic”
also is rather similar to that of Pareto’s Class I. As Lasch describes “the new
narcissist,”
He  seeks  not  to  inflict his  own  certainties on  others but  to  find  a
meaning in life. Liberated from the superstitions of the past, he doubts even
the reality of his own existence. Superficially relaxed and tolerant, he finds
little use for dogmas of racial and ethnic purity but at the same time forfeits

the security of group loyalties and regards everyone as a rival for the favors
conferred by a paternalistic state. His sexual attitudes are permissive rather
than puritanical, even though his emancipation from ancient taboos brings
him no sexual peace. . . . Acquisitive in the sense that his cravings have no
limits, he does not accumulate goods and provisions against the future, in
the manner of the acquisitive individualist of nineteenth century political
economy,  but  demands immediate gratification and  lives  in  a  state  of
restless, perpetually unsatisfied desire.
## [236]
Another suggestive parallel between the types described by Pareto and
behavioral patterns described in more recent sociological literature derives
from the work of sociologist Beverly Nagel Lauwagie, who has extended
the ecological concepts of “K-strategists” and “r-strategists” to the behavior
of  human social (specifically,  ethnic) groups. Ecologists distinguish
between animal species that compete for the limited and life-supporting
resources of an environment by different “strategies” or behavior patterns.
“K-strategist” species seek to maximize K, a mathematical parameter that
represents the carrying capacity of an environment for the species, “the
maximum population of  a  species which a  given environment can
maintain.” As Lauwagie describes an analogous human population of K-
strategists,
an ethnic group or other social group subject to K-selection occupies a relatively stable and
predictable environment. In  maximizing K,  it  attempts to  seize  and  hold  some  set  of
resources and  extract the  energy  produced by  them  through its  organization and
technology, reinforced by cultural and normative systems. That is, it obtains and maintains
a competitive advantage in an environment through organizational properties instead of
genetic ones. These properties include military and political resources as well as other
organizational and/or technological resources  which allow  it  to  exploit the  available
resources more fully than its competitors or to prevent its competitors from exploiting
them.
## [237]
Lauwagie cites as an example of human K-strategists an ethnic group of

Pakistan “which succeeded in obtaining the resources and driving the other
group out of the region . . . by superior military strength. In modern states
such battles are more often carried out in the political arena of the nation-
state.”
## [238]
Human groups that consist of “r-strategists,” on the other hand, would
seek to maximize r, the intrinsic rate of increase of its population.
Like nonhuman r-strategists, these groups would need to discover ephemeral resources
quickly, expand to exploit them before competing groups could enter the region, and then
disperse rapidly.  Unlike K-strategists, who  maximize their  ability to  obtain and  hold
resources in the presence of competitors, r-strategists would maximize their ability to find
and  exploit  resources  fully  before other  competing groups could  enter  the  particular
environment. Their success would depend on the availability of environments subject to r-
selection and  on  their  ability to  perform the  requisite tasks.  .  .  .  the  temporary and
unpredictable environments exploited by r-strategists should be abundant in times of rapid
social change, such as periods of modernization.
## [239]
Lauwagie applies  the  concept of r-strategy to Gypsies, who  have
survived by  maximizing “their  ability to  (1)  discover new  sources of
income, (2) organize rapidly to exploit these resources, and (3) disperse
quickly in search of new resources as the old ones are exhausted or as they
themselves draw the hostility of gadje [i.e., non-Gypsies].”
## [240]
Although the  parallels are  not  exact, human K-strategists resemble
Pareto’s  Class  II  types  in  their  dependence on  stable  relationships and
environments (persistence of aggregates) and in an apparent tendency to use
force to acquire life-supporting resources. Human r-strategists, on the other
hand, resemble Pareto’s Class I types in their dependence on abilities to
make new  combinations, to  invent new  ways  of  exploiting such
combinations, and to disperse or abandon such combinations when they
cease to be useful or have become a threat.
It must be emphasized that none of the typologies of Pareto, Riesman,
and Lauwagie is rigorously grounded, and there is necessarily some amount

of ambiguity in the traits ascribed to each of the types. None of the types
described is  mutually exclusive with  traits  associated with  the  alternate
type; all human beings and all elites need and make use of persistence and
innovation, force and  manipulation; their  prevalence in  individual
organisms, species, human beings, ethnic or social groups, or elites is a
matter of emphasis and tendency. Regardless of the lack of rigor of these
concepts, however, they remain useful in that they do appear to describe
psychological or  behavioral types  that  are  commonly recognized in
mythology and popular wisdom, and it is remarkable that three different
students of behavior could, from the different perspectives of their separate
disciplines, develop typologies of behavior that display the similarities and
correspondences that those of Pareto, Riesman, Lasch, and Lauwagie do.
Such  similarities suggest that  at  least  two  basic  human character or
psychological types, corresponding roughly to the residues of Pareto’s Class
I (foxes, instinct for combinations) and Class II (lions, instinct for group
persistence or the persistence of aggregates) do exist and that they display
distinctively different behavior with regard to the pursuit and use of power
and resources associated with power.

The Soft Managerial Elite in the United
## States
The psychological types described by Pareto correspond to the patterns
of behavior associated with the prescriptive elites of pre-bourgeois society
and with the two kinds of managerial elite of post-bourgeois society. While,
as  a  very  broad  generalization,  the  aristocratic elites  of  the  agrarian,
hierarchical, traditionalist orders of  prescriptive societies as  well  as  the
managerial elites  of  the  hard  regimes exhibited a  high  concentration of
Class II residues and tended to rely on force and the psychic and ideological
correlates of force (self-sacrifice, endurance of suffering, postponement of
gratification, heroism, ideologies of faith and deference, the use of armed
forces, harsh  and  frequent physical punishment, torture, etc.),  the  soft
managerial elites  of  the  highly technological, mobile, depersonalized,
innovating mass society exhibit a high concentration of Class I residues and
tend to rely on manipulation and its correlates to meet challenges and solve
problems.
The bourgeois elite of the 19th century did not conform closely to either
Class  I  or  Class  II  types, however,  and  it  is  probable that  this  elite
represented a  mixture or  equilibrium of  the  two.  Class  I  types  in  the
bourgeois elite may have derived from entrepreneurial and economically
innovative elements that acquired wealth and leadership positions through
industry and commerce and gained political power in the local communities
and the legislative assemblies that exercised sovereignty in the bourgeois
state. Class II types in the bourgeois elite may have derived from persistent
aristocratic elements (e.g., Bismarck, Palmerston, R.E. Lee) or from non-

aristocratic elements that  gained entry  to  the  bourgeois  elite  through
military skill exercised in wars and imperial expansion (e.g., Ulysses S.
Grant) or from behavior associated with Class II residues in colonial and
frontier theaters. While the industrial, commercial, and financial economic
patterns and the parliamentary and constitutionalist political institutions of
bourgeois  society  promoted Class  I  residues, then,  the  persistence of
prescriptive elites  and  the  availability of  situations in  which Class  II
residues could be rewarded and promoted tended to bring these types into
the elites of the 19th century and to modify the tendencies toward behavior
typical of Class I residues. Moreover, the bourgeois ethic of socially and
morally rooted individualism also tended to moderate the concentration of
Class  I  types  and  behavior in  the  bourgeois  elite  by  retaining group
solidarity (the family, community, class, nationality) as a criterion for the
selection of elites.
As the revolution of mass and scale proceeded in the Western societies
of the late 19th century, Class II types tended to become more unusual in
the bourgeois elite and Class I types tended to prevail. Aristocratic elements
from the old prescriptive elites tended to fall out of the elite or defer to the
political and  economic elites  of  the bourgeois  order  and  the  emerging
managerial groups. Frontiers were closed, wars became less common or
changed in  the  types  that  led  and  took  part  in  them,  colonies  became
civilized, and  imperial expansion relied more on  economic and
organizational skills than on military talents and virtues. As this process
occurred, the bourgeois ethic itself underwent a transformation, changing
from socially and morally responsible individualism to a “rugged” or anti-
social individualism that denied social and moral responsibilities and was
more  consistent with  the  mentality of  the  Class  I  residues  that  were
becoming prominent in the bourgeois elite. Pareto himself noted this trend

toward a concentration of Class I types in the elites of the late 19th century
and saw in it the rise of what he called “pluto-democracy,” the alliance of a
financial capitalist elite  with  the  masses against the  older  military and
landed classes of the prescriptive order. In fact, what Pareto perceived was
the beginning of the managerial revolution and the emergence of the soft
managerial elites, the  elimination  of  the  mixed bourgeois  elite  and  its
replacement by an elite that relied on control of technical and managerial
skills and in which Class I residues were becoming predominant.
The  principal reason for  the  selection of  Class I  residues  and
manipulative skills in the emerging managerial elites in certain countries
was the role of the mass population in these societies in politics and the
economy during the course of the revolution of mass and scale and the need
of the new elites to design ways in which the masses could be disciplined
and used as a base of their power. “In the closing era of the late nineteenth
century,” wrote Carleton J.H.   Hayes, “the masses of mankind attained to a
self-consciousness and a social importance without previous parallel.” The
principal force behind the  emergence of  the  masses  was  the
“industrialization of the nineteenth century.”
By  prompting mass  migration  to  cities  and  factories for  the  mass
production of goods, it broke multitudes loose from local economy and
customary dependence on nobleman or country gentleman and herded them
in  big  metropolitan centers peculiarly favorable to  mass  suggestion and
mass action. Here they learned to pit against the self-interest and industrial
combinations of employers a self-interest of their own and the institutions
of trade unionism. Here, too, they had the incentive and opportunity to
agitate for democratic government, for popular education, for social reform.
Here,  finally,  they  provided abundant fertile  soil  for  the  propagation of

nationalism or Marxism.
## [242]
The masses thus provided a market for mass production, a constituency
for political forces, and an audience for mass media, and those who used
managerial skills to create, operate, and direct organizations that made use
of the masses acquired a scale of wealth, power, and cultural influence that
was  not  available to  the  smaller  and  simpler organizations  of  the
prescriptive and bourgeois elites.
Although mass society developed in America and Europe in the late
19th century, it was less developed in Germany and Russia (and in Eastern
and Southern Europe) than in the West. In Germany and Russia, traditional
elites tried to retain (and for a time succeeded in retaining) control of the
principal mass organizations in the state and economy and to use the skills
of  new  managerial elements outside  the  traditional elites  for  their  own
purposes and  interests. In  the West,  however,  the  bourgeois  elites  were
unable to  control mass  organizations, and  the  new  managerial elites
differentiated themselves from the bourgeois order, with different interests
and an increasingly different composition. In order to control and make use
of the mass population in the West, the new managerial elites relied on
manipulative disciplines and the ideologies associated with them rather than
on  force,  which was  not  as  effective or  as  profitable in  organizing the
masses. The  result  in  the  Western societies was  the  evolution of  a
managerial elite  that  depended  mainly on  the  manipulation of  mass
consumption, mass political participation in a managerial state involved in
continuous social  and  economic amelioration through the  application of
managerial skills to social arrangements, and homogenization of the mass
market, political base, and audience through the organizations of culture
and communication. The emerging elite selected its members on the basis

of their ability to make use of manipulative managerial skills, a selection
that tended to recruit Class I residues into the elite.
In the United States in the early 20th century, the high level of mass
participation in the political system, economy, and culture facilitated the
emergence  of  a  soft  managerial  regime and  an  elite  that  depended on
manipulative techniques of social and political control. The mainstream of
Progressivist liberal ideology reflected and rationalized the evolution of a
soft  regime through the  environmentalist and  relativist premises of
progressivist thought and their hedonistic and cosmopolitan implications. In
the  earliest stages of  managerial emergence, however,  some  ideological
formulas expressed the ideas and values of hard managerialism. Theodore
Roosevelt’s “New Nationalism” in the campaign of 1912 articulated ideals
of national solidarity and identity, and German social and political thought,
which often  expressed nationalist,  racialist, and  authoritarian  ideas,
influenced a number of American progressivist intellectuals, many of whom
had been educated in German universities. Perhaps the clearest exponent of
ideas  that  could  have  served as  a  rationalization of  a  hard  managerial
regime in the United States was Brooks Adams, who supported Roosevelt’s
New Nationalism and expressed ideas of national and racial solidarity, an
ascetic economic theory that approximated a kind of “national socialism,”
imperial expansion, military discipline, and  the  explicit rejection of
cosmopolitan and hedonistic values. By 1913, however, Adams had come to
believe that Roosevelt, “at the supreme moment of his life, [was] diverted
from his chosen path toward centralization of power, and projected into an
environment of, apparently, for the most part, philanthropists and women,
who could hardly conceivably form a party fit to aid him in establishing a
vigorous, consolidated, administrative system.”
## [243]
The  predominance of
Progressivist intellectuals and reformers who expressed cosmopolitan and

hedonistic themes  in  Progressivist thought and  political movements
excluded those  such  as  Adams who  sought the  construction  of  a  hard
managerialism. The Wilson administration, despite the failure of its efforts
to institutionalize cosmopolitan formulas in international affairs, embarked
the  emergent  managerial regime in  the  United States on  a  path  of
development as a soft regime from which it has not deviated since, and the
ideological defenses of the managerial regime in the United States have
generally reflected its soft character. Moreover, as Daniel Bell
## [244]
has noted,
changes in the American economy and culture in the 1920s undermined
bourgeois ascetic and particularist formulas and perpetuated the high levels
of  mass  consumption and  social  mobility that  make  mass  participation
possible and encourage the formation of a soft managerial regime.
The  prevalence  of  Class  I  residues in  the  soft  managerial elite,  its
consequent avoidance of the use of force, and its reliance on manipulation
have profound consequences for its behavior and policies and indeed for the
kind  of  society it  tries  to  construct. “Force,” as  Pareto noted, is  “the
foundation of all social organization,”
## [245]
but an elite composed largely of
Class I residues finds this principle difficult to understand and apply. The
tendency of the soft managerial elites has been to ignore force and the
ideas, institutions, emotions, and values associated with it, to try to replace
force in social and political relationships with manipulation—rehabilitation
in place of punishment, negotiations and diplomacy in place of war, social
reform in  place  of  coercive discipline for  the  mass  population, child
psychology in place of strict family discipline—and to managerialize the
instruments of force. The heroic and ascetic moral codes associated with
prescriptive elites  and  with  some  elements of  the  bourgeois  elite  are
replaced by the ideological formulas of hedonism and cosmopolitanism,
which, in the form of liberal humanitarianism, discard appeals to sacrifice

for the nation and other concrete or particularized identities and groups.
Traditional moral values themselves, emphasizing the moral responsibility
of the individual and reward and punishment as the proper responses to
individual conduct, are  replaced by  ideologies of  environmentalism and
relativism, which comport with the inclination of the managerial elite to
avoid moral judgments and  to  respond to crime and  violence with
managerial and manipulative solutions. The tendency of the soft elite to
perceive the  persistence of  traditional and  bourgeois  social  institutions,
ideas and values, and behavior as “pathologies” in need of manipulative
therapies administered by its technically skilled experts is consistent with
its  psychological type  and  its  ideological formulas and  also  reflects the
interests of  the  elite  in  challenging  traditional and  bourgeois  codes  and
institutions for the enhancement of its own power. The psychological type
that is dominant in the soft managerial elite thus correlates with its ideology
as well as with its material interests in the proliferation and expansion of
mass organizations and their reliance on managerial and technical skills.
The managerialization of the instruments of force is one of the most
important results of the predominance of Class I residues in the managerial
elite, for it means that when the managers do make use of force, they do so
in accordance with their prevalent psychic or instinctual inclinations and
that  their  use  of  force  is  often  inappropriate or  maladroit.  As  the
organizations that provide coercive functions in society—armed services
and police forces—expand in size, they, like other enlarged organizations,
tend to make increasing use of managerial and technical skills to perform
these  functions, and  this  tendency creates a  need  for  technically and
managerially skilled elites  within the  instruments of  force.  In  the  soft
managerial regimes, in which Class I residues prevail within the elites, the
same type tends to replace traditional Class II residues as the controlling

and  directing element within the  instruments of  force. This  tendency is
evident in  the  armed services, but  it  is  also  apparent in  the  large
metropolitan police forces, where court decisions, minority  hiring
programs, public relations, specialized training, forensic science,
rehabilitative penology, and social management and therapy have reduced,
restricted, circumscribed, or  replaced the  reliance on  force  by  law
enforcement agencies in the apprehension, interrogation, and punishment of
criminals. The same trend is evident in the national law enforcement and
intelligence agencies. The FBI currently tends to concentrate on forms of
crime and fraud that are generally non-violent rather than on bank robberies
and kidnappings, as in its legendary days. The CIA, which to a large degree
was established as a managerial bureau and has never had much room for
Class II types in its administrative hierarchy, since the 1960s has displayed
a tendency to rely on what Stewart Alsop called the “prudent professionals”
rather  than  the  “bold  Easterners” as  a  dominant elite,
## [246]
to  expand its
reliance on  “national technical  means” of  intelligence collection and  to
reduce or  eliminate “human intelligence” and  the  use  of  covert  action,
which may take violent forms.
In the armed forces, the tendency to managerialization is not new, and
its history can be traced back at least to the late 17th century. In that period,
noted historian John U. Nef,
As standing armies came into being, economic organization assumed in connection with
military life an importance that was novel in history. In France the earliest important
artillery school was established at Douai in 1679. For the first time the organization of
such special schools and of regular medical and religious corps, corps of engineers, and the
provision of academies for military exercise were regarded as a necessary part of the
preparations for warfare. The building and the operation of these schools and academies
added to the capital expended upon military preparations which required a knowledge of
economics and a gift for administration rather than military virtues on the field of battle.
The center of military responsibility tended to shift from the general to the administrator.
## [247]

And Nef quotes the 17th-century Anglo-Irish soldier, the Earl of Orerry,
as writing in 1677 that “we make War more like Foxes, than Lyons, and you
have twenty Sieges for one Battel.”
## [248]
Yet it was not until the late 19th century, with the technology of modern
warfare and  the  organizational  enlargement of  armies, navies, and  their
administrative staffs, that this trend toward the managerialization of war
became dominant. “Total war” involves not only the carrying of war to a
targeted civilian population as well as to hostile military forces but also the
mobilization of all dimensions of mass society in the war effort—economic,
psychological and  sociological, political, and  technological. The
development of  mass communications, electronics, cybernetics, nuclear,
biological, and  chemical weaponry,  and  of  business management and
organizational techniques and  their  application to  military institutions
encourages the  tendency to  the  managerialization of  force  and  the
prevalence of military leaders in whom Class I rather than Class II residues
are dominant. The transformation of the American military elite and the
American “way of war” is well illustrated by the replacement of leaders
strong in  Class  II  residues such  as Douglas MacArthur  and George
S.  Patton by the essentially Class I types of Dwight D. Eisenhower, William
Westmoreland, William  Crowe, and Colin  Powell, and  the  change was
brought nearly to completion by the “McNamara revolution” of the 1960s,
in which a concerted and deliberate effort to replace traditional military
training and education, conduct, values, institutions, and leaders was carried
out. The trend has been even more accelerated with the establishment of a
volunteer army and the integration of women and minorities into the armed
services, since  both  these  developments emphasize as  inducements to
enlistment the  acquisition of  managerial and  technical skills  that  are
compatible with Class I psychological impulses.

Although the managerialization of force has involved a massive increase
in the amount of destructive power at the disposal of a state, it also has had
the  effect  of  undermining the  capacity of  an  elite  to  use  this  power
effectively. Defense specialist Jeffrey Record has commented on this effect
in American military policy:
Confidence in technology as the arbiter of combat is natural on the part
of  a  historically  illiterate managerial technocracy that  for  years  has
confused leadership with management, effectiveness with efficiency, and
tactics with technology. For decades what has passed for the professional
warrior in the United States has all too often been a bureaucrat in uniform,
persuaded that virtually all problems on the battlefield are susceptible to
managerial or  technological resolution, and  whose professional standing
hinges on acquired technical expertise rather than a demonstrated capacity
to lead men in combat.
## [249]
Colonel Harry G.  Summers, Jr.  has also noted the effect of military
managerialism on the conduct of the Vietnam War:
Instead of concentrating attention on military strategy which has become unfashionable
after World War II (and to many, irrelevant in the nuclear era), there was an increased
emphasis on technical, managerial, and bureaucratic concerns. Instead of being experts in
the application of military force to achieve the political ends of the United States, we
became neophyte political scientists and  systems analysts and  were  outclassed by  the
civilian professionals who dominated national security policy under Secretary of Defense
Robert S.   McNamara  after  1961.  .  .  The  rationalistic economic approach dominated
military strategy formulation throughout the Vietnam war.
## [250]
Pareto himself noted the relationship between the “economic approach”
to warfare and the predominance of Class I residues in an elite. Under the
rule of an elite in which Class I residues prevail, he wrote, “Wars become
essentially economic. Efforts are made to avoid conflicts with the powerful
and the sword is rattled only before the weak. Wars are regarded more than
anything else as speculations.”
## [251]

James Burnham, then, was  partially in  error  when  he  predicted that
managerial elites would rely on war and display a high concentration of
Class II residues.
## [252]
Burnham correctly saw that preparation for war would
play an important role in the development of managerial society and in the
power of the managerial elite. What he did not fully appreciate, however,
was  that  war  itself  would become managerialized and  that  the  military
managers would display the same psychological type and the same patterns
of behavior and mentality that managers in the corporations, the mass state,
and the mass organizations of culture and communication would exhibit.
Preparations for war, not war itself, are indeed crucial to the soft managerial
regime as  means by  which the  managerial bureaucracy can  justify the
expansion of the state and its fusion with the economy and also for the
fusion of  research and  development institutions and  the  managerial
intelligentsia within them with the state and its managerialized instruments
of force. But the use of military preparations by the managerial elite does
not mean that it becomes bellicose and eager to engage in war. Indeed, the
opposite is  the  case.  The  massive military force  at  the  disposal of  the
managerial elite and its regime is seldom used—when it is used, it is often
against relatively  weak  opponents such  as  Vietnam, Grenada, Libya, or
Panama (the sword is rattled only before the weak)—and challenges are
generally met by manipulative (e.g., economic sanctions) rather than by
coercive means.
## [253]
The expansion of the managerial war machine simply
represents the revolution of mass and scale within military organizations
and  the  emergence  of  soft  managerial elites  within them  and  not  any
increased dependence on war, force, or the ideas, values, emotions, and
institutions that  traditionally accompany force.  Pareto was  aware  of  the
infusion of Class I residues into the elite that modern warfare produces. “As
regards modern times,” he wrote, “wars require not only men but also huge

expenditures in  money,  which can  be  met  only  by  intensive economic
production, so that if wars in themselves increase the warrior element in
governing classes, preparations for war reduce it, drawing industrial and
commercial elements into the seats of power.”
## [254]
Reliance on advanced
technological systems, bureaucratized mass organizations and procedures,
and  technical  and  managerial skills  in  the  preparations for  modern war
promotes Class I residues within the leadership of the military forces of the
soft managerial regimes and tends to exclude Class II residues.
The instruments of coercion, of course, are not the only or even the
principal institutions on which the managerial apparatus of power in the soft
regimes relies for its control of mass society. The managerial state relies
mainly on the bureaucratic elite of the state and the mass corporation for the
supervision of the fused economy and for the control of the processes of
socialization. Bureaucratic and administrative government, which involves
the  planned allocation of  resources  to  different  sectors of  society and
government and the design and implementation of policies, is consistent
with the manipulative skills and the psychological types prevalent in the
soft managerial elites and enables them to enhance their own power through
continuous manipulation of  social change and  ameliorative social
engineering by the application of managerial skills to social arrangements,
rationalized through  meliorist and  utopian ideological formulas. The
training of the managerial bureaucracy in manipulative techniques is thus a
critical priority for the full development of the soft managerial regime.
Bourgeois forces successfully resisted efforts to establish professional
governmental bureaucratic elites in the United States until the era of the
New  Deal,  when Felix  Frankfurter and Lucius Littauer,  an  industrialist,
helped to found the school of public administration at Harvard University.

Under Frankfurter’s influence, the school tended to abandon the traditional
distinction between the design of public policy (traditionally the business of
elected officials) and  the  efficient implementation of  policy by
administrators; and similar schools of public administration founded in the
same era across the United States also tended to abandon this distinction
and to emphasize training the bureaucracy in making policy decisions.
## [255]

Although this emphasis was not entirely victorious, the John F.  Kennedy
School of Government incorporated and expanded the Harvard school of
public administration and designed its educational program to aim “at the
intersection of policy and administration, that is, on the planning, execution,
and judging of public policy.”
## [256]
The  incorporation  of  policy planning and  decision making  in  the
bureaucracy of the mass state is vital to the creation and functioning of a
managerial state, which seeks to replace legislative institutions and their
control of policy and decisions by administrative institutions. Moreover,
government by  administration reflects the  manipulative mode  of  power
relations that characterizes the soft managerial elites. Administration makes
use of the manipulative intellectual and verbal skills associated with Class I
residues and tends to select into the elite those in whom these residues are
prevalent. The role of the Kennedy School (as well as its predecessors since
the New Deal era) in stimulating similar approaches to public policy at
Harvard and elsewhere has been considerable:
Relations with all the other professional schools, even Divinity, have
been  cultivated.  Any  issue  of  public concern from  waste  treatment to
professional ethics, is  considered fair  game  for  seminars, study  groups,
conferences, and colloquies.
A  considerable degree of  institutional imperialism is  at  work  here. A  number of  the
university’s other schools—the Graduate School of Design, the School of Public Health,

even the august Business School—have been forced, sometimes kicking and screaming, to
embrace the new orthodoxies of public policy study. . . . [S]imilar programs sprang up at
Duke, Berkeley, Michigan, Yale, the RAND Corporation, the Hubert Humphrey School in
Minnesota, and even the Lyndon Baines Johnson School in Texas.
## [257]
The reliance of the soft managerial elite on the manipulative mode of
power is  well  illustrated in  the  person of  one  of  the  most  successful
members of the elite, W.  Michael Blumenthal, a Ph.D.  in economics who
taught at  Princeton, former president and  chairman of  the  multinational
Bendix Corporation, Secretary of the Treasury under President Carter, and
currently president of the multinational Unisys Corporation. Blumenthal’s
career thus  encompasses all  three  sectors of  the  managerial regime and
reflects their fusion, and his rise to pre-eminence in the regime through his
use  of  economic  expertise and  managerial skills  illustrates the  role  of
managerial merit rather than status or conformity to bourgeois moral and
social  codes  as  a  path  of  success.  Interviewed by Michael Korda in  a
popular study of  power in  contemporary society,  Blumenthal was
remarkably frank in discussing his views of power. He acknowledged that,
“I don’t have a primary interest in money at all,” and, in Korda’s words,
“what motivates Blumenthal is ‘the exercise of power,’ the desire to go
beyond any imposed limitations.” He also reflects the lack of interest in
ownership and the preference for effective control that serves to distinguish
the corporate manager from the bourgeois entrepreneur:
In common with most modern executives, Blumenthal isn’t even slightly interested in
ownership. Asked if he would like to own Bendix [the predecessor of Unisys], he reacts
with great emphasis, speaking abruptly for the first time. “It’s not ownership that counts—
it’s control. And as chief executive that’s what I’ve got!    We have a shareholders’ meeting
next week, and I’ve got ninety-seven percent of the vote. I only own eight thousand shares.
Control is  what’s  important to  me.  .  .  .  To  have  control over  this  large  animal [i.e.,
presumably, the corporation] and to use it in a constructive way, that’s what I want, rather
than doing silly things that others want me to do.
## [258]
Defining himself as “an operator . . . a synthesizer, not an intellectual,”
Blumenthal perceives his  means  of  control as  “the  ability to  select  and

motivate people,” an ability that he specifically relates to manipulation:
“You also need an understanding of what motivates people in a positive
sense, and in a pejorative sense, you need manipulative skill.”
## [259]
The predominance of Class I residues in the managerial elite, including
the elite of the instruments of force, tends to eliminate Class II types from
the elite. The latter tend to concentrate in the sub-elites or lower strata of
managerial society and to ally with (if they are not already part of) the
remnants of  the  bourgeois  elite,  and  it  is  the  constant refrain of  the
bourgeois and Class II opposition to the managerial regime that the new
elite is “soft” on crime and criminals, cowardly or uncertain in the use of
military force against foreign threats, and in general decadent or effete. The
managers, for their part, tend to regard bourgeois and Class II types as
backward, volatile, aggressive, irresponsible, and even psychopathic in their
appeal to force and its use in political and social conflicts. Both groups,
however, exhibit the limitations of their psychological types. The bourgeois
and Class II types fail to appreciate the value of a fox-like reliance on
manipulation as a means of acquiring and preserving power and meeting
societal challenges; to  them  the  manipulative style  of  power relations
appears to be weak, degenerate, and incompetent. The managers also are
unable to appreciate the value of force in preserving social cohesion and
meeting hostile challenges, and they take what appears to be a “cynical”
view of heroism, patriotism, piety, and traditional morality and loyalties.
The  managers in  general regard such  emotional and  moral  appeals as
obsolete if not fraudulent and those who appeal to them as primitives or
hypocrites. In fact, as Machiavelli and Pareto both recognized, the qualities
of both the lion and the fox are necessary for the stabilization and survival
of elites and the societies they rule. If Pareto concentrated his criticism on
the  predominance  of  Class  I  types  in pluto-democracy,  his  remarks on

ancient Sparta, in which he believed Class II residues were dominant, are
similar to the criticisms of the Spartan constitution made by Aristotle:
The whole system of legislation is directed to fostering only one part or
element of goodness—goodness in war—because that sort of goodness is
useful for gaining power. The inevitable result has followed. The Spartans
remained secure as long as they were at war; but they collapsed as soon as
they acquired an empire. They did not know how to use the leisure which
peace brought; and they had never accustomed themselves to any discipline
other and better than that of war.
## [260]
Although Pareto in many respects admired Sparta and praised it on the
grounds that  “Humanitarianism,  which is  the  bane  of  decaying ruling
classes, never infected the Spartans, even when they had fallen away from
their ancient virtue,”
## [261]
like Aristotle, he also recognized the limitations of
the Spartan state:
[T]he Spartan aristocracy was handicapped by its lack of combination-instincts, even in its
one  special field  of  activity,  warfare; and  to  an  even  greater extent in  politics and
diplomacy. In that department the nimble frivolousness of the Athenians and the slow-
moving conservatism of  the  Spartans had  untoward consequences that  were  not  very
different.
## [262]
The over-development of either Class I or Class II types in an elite tends
to debilitate it in making use of the virtues and skills derived from the other
type.  Societies in  which the  elites  are  dominated by  lions  tend  to  be
belligerent, aggressive, and warlike in external policies and authoritarian or
repressive internally. They show little genius for innovation and reform, and
their leaders are often the victims of their own stolidity and are outwitted by
the cunning and manipulation displayed by those who challenge them with
Class I residues. On the other hand, societies in which Class I residues are
predominant tend  to  have  little  staying power. Their  leaders can  give  a

multiplicity of reasons for not using force and for showing why force would
be  inappropriate,  ineffective, too  dangerous, or  even  immoral, and  for
compromising and  negotiating with  criminal or  aggressive rivals. Such
societies tend  to  be  passive or  even  pacifistic in  external policies and
liberal, tolerant,  or  permissive internally. They  often  show  a  genius for
innovation in  political and  social  measures as  well  as  in  cultural
achievements (and  thus  are  praised by  artists  and  intellectuals as  being
“high cultures,” but they show little talent or interest in conserving basic
social relationships  and  loyalties or  in  summoning and  using the
ideas,values, institutions, and emotions that sustain the use of force and the
endurance of conflict and suffering. When a society dominated by Class I
types encounters challenges or threats from Class II types (which tend to
concentrate in the sub-elite or mass population as they are excluded from
the elite or which dominate other societies as elites), they can respond to
them only by means of manipulation. Often such manipulation succeeds,
but  sometimes Class  II  elements cannot be  manipulated. They  envelop
themselves in ideologies that motivate and discipline their adherents (Islam
and  militant Marxism and  nationalism, for  example) and  resist  the
propaganda, promises, and  material inducements offered  by  the  Class  I
elite, or they originate from cultures in which such offers mean little. If
such  challenges from  Class  II  types  have  the  material means at  their
disposal, they present an almost invincible threat to the Class I elite that is
unable to use its manipulative skills to advantage and is unable or unwilling
to use force to meet the challenge. If the challenge comes from outside the
society, the result is often conquest of the society and the destruction of the
elite of Class I types. If it comes from within the society, from elements in
the sub-elite or mass, the result is often a violent revolution and the coming
to power of a new elite in which Class II residues will come to predominate.

The hypertrophy or over-concentration of Class I residues in an elite
thus represents a serious vulnerability of its maintenance of power and a
danger to it and the society it rules. The soft managerial elites in the late
20th  century exhibit this  hypertrophy of  Class  I  residues and  of  the
mentality, ideology, and behavior associated with them. The first (and often
the only) inclination of the soft managerial elite in the face of a challenge is
to manipulate it by means of managerial skills, to buy it off or placate it, to
rehabilitate or  reform it,  to  persuade or  negotiate with  it,  to  co-opt or
assimilate it, and, if none of these techniques works, to tolerate and ignore it
and to manipulate public opinion so that the challenge is re-defined and
declared to  be  resolved or  overcome. The  soft  managerial regime has
developed the  skills  and  techniques  of  mass  manipulation to  their  most
sophisticated level in history, and it has immense material and technical
resources at its disposal for manipulation. Thus far, it has been successful in
its efforts to manipulate and postpone or avoid conflicts with most of its
challenges, and it may continue to do so for some time. It also has been
fortunate in  not  encountering as  yet  a  sufficiently powerful coercive
challenge that  it  has  not  been  able  to  manipulate successfully.  Yet,  if
Pareto’s theory of class circulation has any validity, the predominance of
Class I residues in the soft managerial elites must yield to the coercive
challenges presented by the concentration of Class II residues in the sub-
elite  and  mass  population or  to  similar elements that  predominate in
societies outside  the  soft  managerial regime. It  may  be  noted that
managerial undermining of bourgeois institutions and values weakens the
social constraints in the lower strata of society and indirectly encourages the
release of Class II residues in violence. The failure of the soft managerial
elite in the United States to integrate mass society under its ideology of
managerial liberalism and  the  persistence of  anti-managerial  elements

outside the elite suggest that such elements may be prepared to make use of
force  to  challenge the  managerial regime. In  the  perception of  such
elements, the  managerial elites  in  the  United States and  the  other  soft
managerial regimes have failed to legitimize themselves, and it is unlikely
that these elites will be able to develop adequate responses to internal or
external challenges that make use of force or violence, formulate or use
ideologies or  myths that  command a  mass  following, and  possess
significant material means so long as the Class I psychological type that
prevails within  the  elite  avoids the  use  of  force  and  relies  almost
exclusively on manipulation as a means of retaining power and meeting
societal challenges.

## The Hard Managerial Regimes
In The Managerial Revolution,  James Burnham argued  that Nazi
Germany “is today a managerial state in an early stage” and that “Russia is
the  nation which has,  in  structural aspects, advanced furthest along  the
managerial road.”
## [263]
Burnham did  not  recognize a  distinction between
“soft” and “hard” managerial regimes, and his account of the development
and the likely future of managerial society in the United States took the two
totalitarian regimes in Germany and Russia as models for what would occur
in  the  United States. His  application of  the  theory of  the  managerial
revolution to the National Socialist and Soviet regimes occasioned much
controversy at the time, as did the parallels that he drew between them and
the New Deal administration of Franklin Roosevelt.
It soon became evident that what was occurring in the United States was
quite different from what had developed in Russia and Germany, and today
it is clear that there are significant differences between these regimes and
the kind of society that has evolved in the United States. Yet Burnham’s
basic argument that the Nazi and Soviet regimes were managerial in nature
was  essentially correct. The  distinctive characteristics of  a  managerial
regime are the predominance of mass organizations, especially in state and
economy; the  operation and  direction of  the  mass  organizations by  a
managerially and technically trained elite; and an ideology that rationalizes
the power of the managerial elite and is hostile to traditional (prescriptive or
bourgeois) elites and their institutions and values. All these characteristics
were present in both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union,
## [264]
though the
evolution of the managerial regimes in these states was quite different from

that of the managerial regimes of the West. As a result of the differing
evolutionary paths, the  character  and  behavior of  the  Nazi  and  Soviet
managerial elites were radically different from those of Western managers.
The revolution of  mass  and  scale  took  place  in  the  economies and
governments of Germany and Russia well before the seizure of power by
the Nazis and the Marxists. By the end of the 19th century, write Bernadotte
E. Schmitt and Harold C. Vedeler,
[T]he  German Reich  was  borne  upward by  an  economic miracle to  the  position of
Europe’s chief industrial state. Germany’s industrial preeminence and constant economic
expansion rested on  unequaled technological virtuosity,  organizing powers, broad
scientific and technological training provided by its institutions of higher education, and
mass discipline of the workers.
## [265]
This industrial pre-eminence was paralleled by the rise of a managerial
elite in the German economy and its fusion with the bureaucracy of the
German state.
[I]ndividual owners-entrepreneurs rapidly gave way to a corps of professional managers
who  not  only  operated the  factories, firms,  cartels, and  banks  entrusted to  them  with
exemplary efficiency but also ordered the conditions of their own existence by creating a
managerial elite with a strong internal discipline and an esprit de corps quite different from
the individualistic and nakedly pecuniary ethos common among British businessmen of the
early nineteenth century. . . . [T]he industrial and governmental bureaucracies overlapped
extensively. Public servants managed railroads, mines, telegraph, and telephone services in
the German states. . . .
## [266]
Similarly, though Russia was by no means as industrialized as Germany
or Western Europe in 1914, it also developed a massive industrial plant
prior to the Bolshevik Revolution that also was closely linked to the czarist
state.
[L]ong before Marxian socialism was so much as dreamed of, the Russian state became
the largest landowner, the largest factory owner, the largest employer of labor, the largest
trader, the largest owner of capital, in Russia, or in the world. The needs of its huge armies
made it the largest customer for private industry as well. . . . What the Bolsheviks really
took over in 1917, even before they had nationalized a single industry on their own, was
the largest state economic machine in the world.
## [267]

In neither Germany nor Russia, however, did the new managerial strata
that  operated  the  mass  organizations in  state  and  economy displace the
traditional, largely prescriptive nobility and bureaucracy of the monarchical
state, and these traditional aristocratic and dynastic elites retained control of
the  new  mass  organizations and  relied  on  the  emerging  managerial and
technical elements as subordinate sub-elites that merely administered and
operated the  new  organizations. Nor  did  bourgeois  elites  develop to
challenge the  prescriptive order  or  to  resist  effectively the  rise  of
managerially operated mass  organizations. The  persistence  of  the
prescriptive elites and  the  absence of  bourgeois elites and  their
characteristic ideologies in  Germany and  Russia exerted a  profound
influence on the course of development of the revolution of mass and scale
in  these  two  countries that  significantly differentiated it  from  its
development in the soft managerial regimes.
In both Germany and Russia, then, the revolution of mass and scale in
state and economy took place in tandem and occurred prior to the political
revolutions of 1917 and 1933, and managerial strata emerged within the
mass  organizations but  remained subordinate to  traditional elites. The
political revolutions shattered the  dominance of  the  traditional elites,
however, and enabled the managerial sub-elites to seize power. Both the
Nazis and the Communists extended the size and role of mass organizations
and  consolidated the  power of  the  managerial elites  that  operated and
directed these organizations in their respective countries. This extension of
mass organization in the economy is evident, in the Soviet Union, in the
collectivization of agriculture under Stalin and in the Five Year Plans of the
Soviet economy, and, in Nazi Germany, in the growth of mass production,
national rearmament, massive public works projects, the  decline of
unemployment, and industrial re-organization in the 1930s. In both regimes,

fusion of state and economy was highly developed, formally recognized as
such in the Soviet system and less formally but no less effectively in the
National Socialist system.
In both systems, managerially trained elites exercised control over the
mass  organizations  of  state  and  economy (as  well  as  in  the  mass
organizations of  culture and  communication) and  over  the  regime as  a
whole. Carl J.  Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski, in their classic study of
totalitarianism (largely  based on  an  analysis of  the Nazi  and Soviet
regimes), describe six  traits  that  are  common to  what  they  call  the
“totalitarian syndrome”—an official ideology, a single party typically led by
one  man,  a  terroristic police, a communications monopoly,  a  weapons
monopoly, and a centrally directed economy—and they call attention to the
dependence of  totalitarian systems on  technology in  maintaining their
power.
This technological aspect of totalitarianism is, of course, particularly striking in the matter
of  weapons  and  communications, but  it  is  involved also  in  the  secret  police terror,
depending as it does upon technically enhanced possibilities of supervision and control of
the movement of persons. In addition, the centrally directed economy presupposes the
reporting, cataloging, and calculating devices provided by modern technology. In short,
four of the six traits are technologically conditioned. . . . With few exceptions, the trend of
technological advance implies the trend toward greater and greater size of organization. In
the perspective of these four traits, therefore, totalitarian societies appear to be merely
exaggerations, but nonetheless logical exaggerations, of the technological state of modern
society.
## [268]
Given the importance of technology in maintaining a totalitarian (Nazi
or Soviet) system, those who are able to control and direct technology and
the  mass  organizations that  are  implicit in  “the  trend  of  technological
advance” must constitute at least part of the elite in such regimes. In fact
both the elites of Nazi Germany and of the Soviet Union displayed a high
degree of technical skill. In a study of the elite of Nazi Germany Daniel
J.  Lerner and his colleagues found that there was a strong presence of what

they called the “middle income skill groups,” which they describe as
those who are members [of the middle-income population] by virtue of a distinctive skill
function. These are:    the  corporate entrepreneurs and  managers, skilled in  industrial
production and administration; the bureaucrats, skilled in organizing and administering
controls over social behavior; the lawyers, skilled in interpreting the codified rules of the
game  and  applying them  to  concrete situations; the  industrial engineers and  other
technologists, skilled in applying knowledge to specified social goals.
## [269]
The sample of the Nazi elite examined in this study established that
these middle-income skill groups, largely identical to what Burnham called
managers in a broad or functional sense, constituted 73.6 per cent of the
sample. In other words, in terms of function and profession, the Nazi elite
was  overwhelmingly a  managerial or  technically skilled elite.  Similarly,
Merle Fainsod, analyzing the Soviet elite, wrote,
As  the  dominating force  in  Soviet society,  the  [Communist] Party  can  discharge  its
governing responsibilities effectively only by assimilating the most highly trained and
educated representatives of the younger generations. In consolidating its position as a
governing elite, the Party needs to incorporate the rising stratum in Soviet society—the
engineers and technicians, the plant managers, the bureaucrats, and other representatives of
the new technical, administrative, and cultural intelligentsia.
## [270]
And David Granick found that “There can be no question that managers
comprise a  group  which is  both  highly differentiated from  the  general
Russian population and is recruited very unevenly from among the different
occupational levels of Soviet society,” but that Soviet managers are not
socially distinct from  full-time Communist Party  officials and  “are
frequently not  only  much  the  same  type  of  people, but  are  identical
individuals at different stages of their career.”
## [271]
The economic policies of the Nazi and Soviet regimes also reflected
their reliance on managerial functions, ideas, and interests. Thus, Soviet
historian Michael Voslensky has  called attention to  the  importance of
“Taylorism,” a system of industrial management that underlies much of the
American development of  managerial corporations, in  Lenin’s  post-

revolutionary writings and in contemporary Soviet “labor discipline.”

Daniel Bell, who describes Frederick W.  Taylor as “the founder of scientific
management” in American industry, quotes Lenin as writing in 1919:
The possibility of socialism will be determined by our successes in combining Soviet rule
and Soviet organization or management with the latest progressive measures of capitalism.
We must introduce in Russia the study and teaching of the Taylor system and its systematic
trial and adoption.
## [273]
“Nazi commitment to  the  technocratic ideal,” writes Richard
Grunberger, “was exemplified by the rise of Albert Speer from Nazi court
architect to overlord of the industrial war effort and by the inclusion of the
motorway builder Todt  and  the  car  designer Porsche in Hitler’s
entourage.”
## [274]
Nazi  economic and  industrial policies also  reflected the
managerial nature of the regime:
The major changes in the working of capitalism to be engineered by the Nazis were:   a
rapid  increase in  undistributed profits; the  precedence of  managerial over  stockholder
interest; the diminished influence of banking and commercial capital; the permeation of
the  distributive apparatus by  industrial monopolists; and  a  partial reduction of  the
dominance of  heavy industry by  the  emergent  chemical industry and  certain of  the
metallurgical industries.
## [275]
With the possible exception of the latter development, all these reforms
are characteristic of the managerial economy. Speer himself claimed that “I
had  introduced a  fairly  successful Americanism into  the  armaments
organization, and this innovation was a decisive step toward the manager
revolution of German industry.”
## [276]
The  hostility of  both  National Socialism and Marxism-Leninism to
traditional elites and to the whole fabric of the prescriptive and bourgeois
orders is  implicit in  their  character as revolutionary movements. The
hostility is  obvious in  the  case  of Marxism, which  regards both  the
aristocratic elites of the prescriptive order (“feudalism”) and the capitalist
elite  of  the bourgeois order as  historically outmoded, repressive,

exploitative, and obstacles to progress. In Soviet policy this hostility was
evident in the early history of the regime in the physical persecution of
aristocratic and  bourgeois elements, their  economic and  political
dispossession, and the continuing discrimination against their families, as
well as in systematic efforts to eradicate pre-revolutionary ideologies and
institutions (the family, religion, traditional morality, private property, and
class relationships). Despite the abatement in the intensity of such crusades
against pre-revolutionary culture and institutions, the Soviet state remained
committed to their extirpation.
National Socialism also was hostile to the bourgeois and prescriptive
orders and their elites. Although the Nazis made use of German aristocrats
to gain status for their movement, the role of the aristocracy in positions of
economic and political power diminished under Hitler, who “unequivocally
ruled out the possibility of monarchical restoration [and] excluded members
of  princely houses from  military commands.”
## [277]
Similarly,  though the
Nazis depended on the political support of the German petty bourgeoisie
and the Mittelstand and expressed sympathy for the economic problems of
the middle classes, their ideology rejected bourgeois ideals and values, and
National Socialism expressed and often officially encouraged ideas about
class relationships, the uses of affluence and leisure, the family, sexuality,
violence, and religion that radically conflicted with traditional bourgeois
ideas on these matters.
## [278]
In Mein Kampf, Hitler portrayed the bourgeoisie
as “already worthless for any noble (erhaben) human endeavor” and as, in
David Schoenbaum’s words,
capable of  any  error  of  judgment, failure of  nerve, and  moral  corruption. Bourgeois
behavior, as Hitler saw it, included nationalist hypocrisy while fellow citizens were in
misery, exploitation of labor, class snobbery, the climactic subversion of the war effort in
1918  by  support for  democratic reforms, an  unholy respect for  formal academic
qualifications, a tendency toward syphilis, defined further as willingness to marry the
daughters of  rich  Jews,  cowardice, indifference to  the  realities of  race,  exclusive

preoccupation with money and personal affairs, and identification of the nation with the
interests of the bourgeoisie.
## [279]
In private conversation Hitler stated that, “In the political field there is
no stupider a class than the bourgeoisie.”
## [280]
Revolutionary and  totalitarian movements are  necessarily hostile to
prescriptive and  bourgeois elites and  their  societies because the
differentiation, localism, privacy, moral values, and social institutions of
such  orders are  incompatible with  the  centralization and  extreme
regimentation of the totalitarian regime. Hannah Arendt remarked on this
feature of  totalitarian movements that  “insofar as  individualism
characterized the bourgeoisie’s as well as the mob’s attitude to life, the
totalitarian movements can rightly claim that they were the first truly anti-
bourgeois parties.”
## [281]
Managerial regimes, whether soft or hard, also are
necessarily anti-aristocratic and anti-bourgeois, even when the managerial
elite  is  drawn from  aristocratic  or  bourgeois  and  middle class  social
backgrounds. A managerial elite acquires power by virtue of its technical
skill  in  controlling mass  organizations. It  therefore must  repudiate and
subvert traditional elites, which hold power and status by virtue of their
ownership of  property,  control of  compact organizations, reliance on
localism and  decentralization, personal and  kinship bonds, and  their
adherence to  traditional moral  and  social  codes. The  individualism that
characterizes the bourgeois order and its ideologies also is a constraint on
the development of the managerial regime.
Totalitarian and  revolutionary movements often  express goals  and
values that have little to do with the realities of managerial organizations,
but  in  their  structure and  ideologies they  have  in  fact  promoted the
emergence of managerial elites and their consolidation of autocratic power.
Regardless of the differences in the formal content of ideologies such as

Soviet Marxism,  German National Socialism, and  American  liberalism,
there  is  a  convergence  among them  on  the  underlying themes  and  the
substantive social and political meaning of their doctrines as well as in the
fundamental structural similarities of the regimes that these ideologies help
rationalize in their reliance on mass organizations and on managerial elites
to operate and direct these organizations.
Despite the convergence of the managerial regimes in the Soviet Union,
Nazi Germany, and the United States, however, there also are obvious and
significant differences among them, most especially between the American
soft managerial regime and the hard regimes of the Nazis and Soviets. The
principal differences consist in the reliance on force by the hard managerial
regimes and the reliance on manipulation by soft managerialism as means
of acquiring and retaining power and in the divergent ideologies that prevail
in the two kinds of regime.
In  both  the  Nazi  and  Soviet systems, the  regime relied  on  physical
coercion, sometimes to an extreme degree, and the use of force and ideals
and  values of  group solidarity,  sacrifice, denial, and  postponement of
gratification played  a  large  role  in  their  official  doctrines. The  soft
managerial regime typically seeks to avoid or minimize the use of force and
relies  instead  on  the  instruments and  techniques of  mass  persuasion,
deception, inducement by  material and  psychic gratification, and  the
instigation and manipulation of social change. Consequently, force, group
solidarity, and ascetic themes play little role in the ideology of the soft
managerial regime, and hedonism, immediate gratification, emancipation
from group loyalties, and cosmopolitanism tend to be its dominant values.
These differences between the hard and soft managerial regimes are in fact
indicative of deeper differences that arise from the psychological types that

prevail in the elites that rule them.
In terms of Pareto’s theory of residues, the elites of the hard managerial
regime exhibit a prevalence of Class II residues (instinct for the persistence
of aggregates; lions), while the elites of the soft managerial regime exhibit a
prevalence of  Class I  residues (instinct for  combinations; foxes).
Managerial elites, then,  are  not  limited to  Class  I  residues  and  the
manipulative behavior and policies, avoidance of force and sacrifice, and
ideologies of hedonism, cosmopolitanism, and gratification that correlate
with  Class  I  residues. They  also  can  exhibit a  prevalence of  Class  II
residues and the behavioral, mental, moral, and emotional correlates of this
type. The reasons for the differentiation of managerial regimes into hard
and soft types, with elites composed of essentially different psychological
types, lie  in  the  different economic and  political backgrounds  of  the
societies in which they developed.
In the United States and Western Europe the revolution of mass and
scale was precipitated by the emergence of mass populations concentrated
in  large  urban conglomerations, and  by  the  participation of  mass
populations in the economy as consumers on a vastly increased scale, in the
state as mass electorates, and in society and culture as mass audiences of
the organizations of culture and communication. The managerial elites that
emerged in the mass organizations that contained and disciplined the new
level  of  mass  participation depended on  manipulative modes  of  power
rather than on coercion, which is of limited use in directing and disciplining
the intense activism that characterized the mass population in the West.
Hence, emerging managerial elites in the United States and Western Europe
tended to select for Class I residues, which display skills in manipulation,
whether economic, political, or  communicational. The  hedonistic,

cosmopolitan, and meliorist and utopian formulas of the ideology of the soft
managerial regime not only reflect the psychic and behavioral composition
of  the  elite  of  the  regime but  also  correspond to  and  rationalize the
manipulative disciplines of  mass  consumption, social and  political
homogenization, and ameliorative social engineering.
In both Germany and Russia, however, the revolution of mass and scale
did  not  originate from  or  in  response to  mass  participation. The
development of mass organizations in state and economy, the application of
science and technology to their operation, and the emergence of specially
trained managerial groups within them took place under the supervision and
control of the traditional elites of Russia and Germany. The principal goal
of  the  traditional elites  in  developing mass  organizations  was  the
enhancement of the military capacities of the state. In Imperial Germany
what Thorstein Veblen called the “dynastic state” retained power and used
industrial and scientific achievements for this purpose. “With a view to the
fighting capacity of  the  State,  and  indeed with  no  other  view,”  wrote
Veblen, “the economic system of the country has been controlled wherever
control was conceived to be expedient for this purpose.”
## [282]
Among the gains that have come to the Imperial State, and by no means
least among these gains if one is to judge by the solicitous attention given it,
is the use of the modern technology for warlike equipment and strategy. . . .
Since the modern technology fell into the hands of the Germans they have
taken the lead in the application of this technological knowledge to what
may be called the industrial arts of war, with at least no less zeal and no less
effect than in its utilization in the arts of peace.
## [283]
Ralf Dahrendorf concurs with this aspect of Veblen’s interpretation of
the Imperial German state.

Imperial Germany absorbed industrialization quickly and thoroughly. But she assimilated
this  process to  the  social and  political structures by  which she  was  traditionally
determined. There was no place in these structures for a sizable, politically self-confident
bourgeoisie; for that reason large economic units played an important part from the outset.
The state held a prominent place in the traditional structures; for that reason it took part, as
promoter and owner, in the process of economic development. The state (accepting its
German personification for the moment), which thus managed to use the new power of
industry to  strengthen the  old  power of  tradition, was  itself  characterized by  an
authoritarian blend of severity and benevolence; for that reason, welfare measures of social
policy accompanied industrialization.
## [284]
Veblen’s  concept of  the  “dynastic state,” encouraging economic and
industrial development under closely linked mass organizations in the state
and economy controlled by traditional elites for military purposes, applies
also  to  czarist Russia, which in  the  late  19th  century undertook the
development of  railroads and  related coal-mining and  pig  iron
manufacturing for  military and  strategic ends.  “The  aim  of  the  Russian
government [in economic development],” wrote Hugh Seton-Watson, “was
to increase the military might and prestige of the Russian state.”
## [285]
The militarist course that the revolution of mass and scale took in Russia
and Germany thus tended to draw into the managerial groups that operated
the new mass organizations a preponderance of Class II residues, oriented
to  the  use  of  force  and  to  ideologies correlated with  force  and  group
solidarism. In  the  comparative absence of  mass  consumption  and  mass
political and cultural participation, there was little reason for the dynastic
regimes of  these  elites  to  select  Class  I  residues and  their  skills  in  the
manipulative control of  mass  activities or  to  adopt  or  disseminate the
hedonistic, cosmopolitan, and  meliorist and  utopian ideologies that  are
useful for  the  rationalization and  encouragement of  mass  consumption,
homogenization, and  political participation. The  dynastic state  had  no
reason to promote a homogenization of the mass population as consumers,
political participants, or audience of mass communications and hence no

need for the ideological disciplines and formulas of soft managerialism.
Nor did the elites of the dynastic states have an interest in challenging or
discrediting the ideological basis of their own regimes by the assertion of
the  cosmopolitan, hedonistic, and  meliorist and  utopian formulas that
contributed to  the  Progressivist  challenges to  bourgeois  ideology in  the
emerging soft regimes. The principal ideological need of the dynastic elites
was the formulation and inculcation of doctrines that corresponded to the
hardness of their character, their need to enhance the coercive functions of
military power and  the  cohesion and  solidarity of  the  mass  population.
Thus,  Veblen  argued  that  the  “chief ingredient” of  what  he  called the
“sentimental content” of the concept of the dynastic state “is doubtless the
ancient sense of group solidarity.”
## [286]
Carrying over  a  traditional bias  of  Romantic  loyalty,  infused anew  with  a  militant
patriotism by several successful wars, and irritably conscious of national power in their
new-found economic efficiency, the feudalistic spirit of the population has yet suffered
little if any abatement from their brief experience as a modern industrial community. And
borne up by its ancient tradition of prowess and dynastic aggression, the Prussian-Imperial
State has faithfully fostered this militant spirit and cultivated in the people the animus of a
solidarity of prowess.
## [287]
Czarist Russia in  the  late  19th  century also  sought to  inculcate  an
ascetic, solidarist, and anti-cosmopolitan ideology that included autocratic
paternalism, nationalism, orthodoxy in religion, anti-Semitism, and loyalty
to and solidarity with the Czar and Mother Russia.
The goals of the elites of the dynastic states thus directed the course of
the revolution of mass and scale in such a way as to select for Class II
residues in the emerging managerial groups within the mass organizations
of state, economy, and culture. Yet, having created the apparatus of mass
organizations and having called into being managerial groups to operate
them, the dynastic elites were unwilling to carry forward the logic of the

revolution of mass and scale. They sought to use the apparatus to enhance
their own power, wealth, and military ends, but they were not willing to
allow  the  new  managerial groups to  direct  the  regime and  replace the
traditional elites  or  to  re-design their  societies in  accordance with
managerial needs, interests, or  ideologies. As  Veblen  remarked, “The
Imperial State  .  .  .  may  be  said  to  be  unable to  get  along  without the
machine industry, and also, in the long run, unable to get along with it.”
## [288]
As a result, the dynastic state and its elite were not sufficiently developed
along mass organizational and managerial lines to endure the strains that
prolonged mass warfare in World War I placed on them, and they collapsed
under these strains. The immediate cause of the collapse was not only the
inability of the dynastic war-machine to obtain military victory but also the
failure of  the  dynastic state  to  prevent economic catastrophe and  the
alienation of the mass population.
The deficient administration of the food supply in truth reflected the shortcomings of the
German state  itself  in  the  supreme test  of total  war—the incomplete unity  of  the
Bismarckian Reich  and  the  unreadiness to  work  closely together like  the  British in
carrying out a program of food production and control.
## [289]
Similarly, Russia in 1914 “was primarily agrarian, and its agricultural
technology was in a primitive stage,” and its half-modernized state and
economy were unable to prevent economic, political, and military collapse.
## [290]
A second result of the retention of power by the dynastic elites and their
attempt to  subordinate and  exploit new  managerial sub-elites  was  the
frustration and alienation of the latter. Denied the status and power of the
dynastic elites  and  often  the  opportunity to  perform their  professional
functions, but possessing far more technical qualifications for power and
status than the dynastic elites possessed, the managerial groups in Russia

and Germany were attracted to radical ideologies and political movements
that expressed their resentments and aspirations. The Russian intelligentsia
of the late 19th century, wrote Bertram D. Wolfe,
were lawyers without practice, teachers without schools, graduate clerics without benefices
and  often  without religion, chemists without laboratories, technicians, engineers,
statisticians for whom industry had as yet no need, journalists without a public, educators
without schools, politicians without parties, sociologists and statesmen rejected by the
state  and  ignored by  the  people. They  anticipated and  oversupplied in  advance the
requirements of a world that was slow in coming into being, and sought to serve a folk that
had no use for their services.
## [291]
In short, they were managers without an opportunity to manage the still
underdeveloped managerial state, economy, and society that the dynastic
elite had created, and they became a magnet for all kinds of revolutionary,
utopian, and terrorist ideologies. Similarly, though managerial groups in
Imperial Germany acquired considerably more power and status than in
czarist Russia, they too displayed an affinity for what Fritz Stern has called
the “Germanic ideology,” which “inspired nationalist fantasies and utopias”
among the “educated, civilized classes” of Germany. In the chaotic and
dislocated Weimar Republic, this affinity and their professional and social
frustrations contributed to  their  attraction to  National Socialism, which
closely resembled the Germanic ideology:
For both, [bourgeois] liberalism was the chief enemy, an alien and corrosive force that was
destroying the German Reich. Both demanded the unity and aggrandizement of a folkish
Reich, and both insisted that only a Führer could establish and rule such a Reich. Both
were embittered critics of the bourgeois way of life, of the spirit of capitalism. . . . [T]he
Germanic critics as well as the National Socialists believed . . . in the racial determination
of character and history.
## [292]
The collapse of the dynastic state and its mainly prescriptive elite in
both Russia and Germany in the aftermath of World War I thus afforded an
opportunity for the sudden seizure of power by the managerial sub-elites in
which Class II residues prevailed. What Harold Lasswell and Daniel Lerner
called the “middle income skill groups,” from which the managerial sub-

elites were drawn, became focuses of ideological resentments and frustrated
aspirations:
The individuals from these classes who now came to the fore via the
ideological movements brought with them the frustrations and resentments
cumulated over a century of denial. Having failed to gain office by the
pacific processes of  representative democracy,  they  had  committed
themselves to the seizure of power via totalitarian ideology instrumented by
political violence. . . . It is important to register the historical fact that the
“new men with new ideas” who revolutionized postwar Europe were not of
the  impoverished and  brutalized proletariat—but of  the  frustrated and
vengeful middle groups that had experienced some upward social mobility,
gained some economic rewards, and wanted political power.
## [293]
Historian Jeffrey  Herf  argues  that  what  he  calls  “reactionary
modernism” in Weimar Germany was closely related to the ideology of the
“conservative revolution” and  the  “Germanic ideology” and  sought to
synthesize acceptance of  modern technology with  a  rejection of
“modernity”—“the political values of  the  French Revolution and  the
economic and  social realities created by  the  Industrial Revolution.”
“Reactionary modernism” was  particularly well-received by  German
engineers who suffered from unemployment in the 1930s and from lack of
state armament programs that could employ and reward their professional
skills and values.
By 1932, only 20 percent of the graduates of the technical universities found employment
as engineers. . . . National Socialism promised them the possibility of combining self-
interest and service to the Volksgemeinschaft. The cultural politicians among the engineers
came to believe that National Socialism would silence the critics of technology from the
so-called cultivated world and would also wrest technical development from control by
commercial interests. Nazism’s appeal for the engineers was not an antimodernist attack
on technology but a promise to unleash modern technology from the constraints the Social
Democrats had placed on it.
## [294]

Once in power, the new managerial elites in the Soviet Union and Nazi
Germany,  unrestrained by  the  defunct prescriptive order  of  the  dynastic
state  that  they  held  in  contempt,  proceeded to  construct regimes in
accordance with  their  interests and  that  reflected their  dominant
psychological types  in  their  reliance on  force  and  the  ideologies of
asceticism and group solidarity.
The ideologies of the hard managerial regimes reflect the prevalence of
Class II residues in their elites as well as the different interests that arise
from  the  different  structural development of  the  hard  and  soft  regimes.
National Socialism and Marxism-Leninism both retain the scientism and
utopianism that characterize all managerial ideologies. One of the principal
justifications for the power of any managerial elite is the claim that its skill
in the application of science to human and social problems can perfect or
significantly ameliorate the human condition. Scientism and utopianism are
thus closely connected, and the hard managerial regimes as well as the soft
make use of both ideas. Marxism presents itself as a science and regards its
claims and  achievements as  the  result  of  the  application of  science to
human relationships. It is through scientific understanding of the laws of
history and social evolution that the Marxist utopia of a classless society is
pursued. Similarly,  National Socialism also  relied on  science  in  its
idolization of  technology and  in  its  reliance on  eugenics and  biological
determinism to  develop its  own  utopia of  a  powerful, racially pure
Thousand-Year  Reich, led  by Übermenschen  and  free  of  the  racial
degeneration and conflicts that have retarded human progress in the past.
The utopian myths of the hard regimes are typically Spartan and resemble
what Barrington Moore,  Jr.  called “Catonism,” a  rhetoric and  ideology
characterized by
advocacy of the sterner virtues, militarism, contempt for “decadent” foreigners, and anti-

intellectualism. . . . Obedience, hierarchy, often with overtures of race or at least biological
metaphors about society, become the watchword. But the hierarchy is not supposed to take
on  the  character of  modern impersonal  bureaucracy.  Indeed, there  is  much  talk  of
comradeship, human warmth.
## [295]
Amelioration occurs through the  imposition of  social  unity,  coercive
discipline, and the deferral of gratification, in contrast to the eudaemonian
utopianism and meliorism of  the  soft  regimes,  in  which amelioration
consists in the acquisition of mass affluence, material accumulation and
gratification, leisure, and dispersion of and emancipation from traditional
social and moral constraints and identities. The utopian formulas of soft and
hard managerial regimes thus reflect the hedonistic and cosmopolitan ethics
of the one and the asceticism and solidarism of the other. Moreover, in both
the  soft  and  hard  regimes, utopian and  meliorist formulas serve  as
ideological challenges to  the legitimacy and  conservatism of  traditional
elites and as disciplines for the control of mass followings.
## [296]
Yet National Socialism and Marxism-Leninism reject the hedonism and
cosmopolitanism that  characterize the  ideologies of  the  soft  managerial
regimes. While this rejection is consistent with the predominance of Class II
residues in the hard managerial elites, it also corresponds to the structural
interests that  distinguish these  elites  from  those  of  the  soft  managerial
regimes. In the latter, hedonistic and cosmopolitan ideologies and values
rationalize and correspond to the imperatives of mass consumption, which
requires the stimulation of aggregate demand and the homogenization of the
mass market, and to the need to homogenize, manipulate, and discipline a
mass population participating in political processes and as an audience of
mass communications. Cosmopolitan and hedonistic ideologies also serve
to discredit and delegitimize bourgeois moral and ideological codes and
institutions as repressive, hypocritical, parochial, and obsolete, and thereby
challenge the legitimizing formulas of the bourgeois elite.

In  the  hard  managerial regimes, however,  mass  consumption and  a
homogenized market are far less important to the economy, which, as in the
dynastic regime, revolves around the state. Although the Nazis succeeded in
ending the German economic crisis and restoring national prosperity, their
ideology and policies rejected mass consumption and the hedonism and
self-indulgence that accompany and rationalize it.
[the German people] . . . were willing to make the sacrifices which the Leader demanded
of them . . . :  the loss of personal freedom, a Spartan diet (“Guns before Butter”) and hard
work. By the autumn of 1936 the problem of unemployment had been largely licked,
almost everyone had a job again and one heard workers who had been deprived of their
trade-union rights joking, over their full dinner pails, that at least under Hitler there was no
more  freedom  to  starve. “Gemeinutz vor Eigenutz!”  (“The Common Interest before
Self!”) was a popular Nazi slogan in those days. . . . [T]here was no doubt that the masses
had been taken in by the new “national socialism” which ostensibly put the welfare of the
community above one’s personal gain.
## [297]
The Soviets also avoided the development of mass consumption and its
attendant ideologies as signs of bourgeois decadence and luxuriousness and
emphasized the production of capital goods instead of consumer goods.
Writing  of  both  the  Nazi  and  Soviet economic systems, Friedrich and
Brzezinski state,
If the plans call for industrialization, controls must be set up and maintained for forcing a
substantial part of the social product into capital goods, even when the standard of living
and level of consumption of the people is quite low. . . . The failure to satisfy consumer
needs and demands cannot, strictly speaking, be held against these systems, since they did
not operate with the purpose of satisfying the consumer.
## [298]
Advocacy of increased consumer industry by G.M.    Malenkov in 1954
and  1955  was  the  proximate  cause of—or at  least  the  principal
rationalization for—his fall  from  power in  his  rivalry with Nikita
Khrushchev,  and  his  emphasis on  consumer goods was  denounced as
“utterly alien to Marxist-Leninist political economy and to the general line
of the Communist Party.”
## [299]

In  the  soft  managerial regimes, cosmopolitan ideologies serve  the
managerial state, economy, and organizations of culture and communication
through their  challenge to  bourgeois  values and  institutions  and  their
psychic homogenization of the mass population as a political base, a mass
market of consumers, and a mass audience. In the hard managerial regimes,
however, although there is a need to homogenize the masses and to discredit
bourgeois  and  prescriptive ideologies and  institutions, the  dispersion of
solidarism and  group loyalties  that  result from  the  inculcation of
cosmopolitan ideas and values cannot answer this need. The hard regimes
need to prepare the mass population for the use of force, the endurance of
conflict and sacrifice, and loyalty to and solidarity with the regime. In place
of  cosmopolitan ideologies, therefore, they  generate those  of  group
solidarity, though the group is characteristically a mass or collective identity
(race, nation, party, working class) that challenges and seeks to homogenize
particular identities  (e.g.,  provincialism, traditional class  and  social
loyalties, religious sectarianism, etc.)     The National Socialist appeal to a
mass identity and collective solidarity was explicit in its ideal and slogans
of “folk community” and found considerable support in the economically
depressed, politically unstable, and socially disrupted Weimar Republic:
Out of the social disorientation of the Depression . . . arose a craving for a return to the
womb of community; this collective infantile regression would obliterate all conflicts—
between employers and  employees, town  and  countryside, producers and  consumers,
industry and craft—requiring continuous and infinitely complex regulation.
The Nazis exploited this craving for ‘folk community’ and evolved their own synthesis of
quasi-socialist promise and quasi-capitalist fulfillment.
## [300]
Although Marxism-Leninism tends  toward ideals that  approximate
cosmopolitanism in its antipathy for nationalism, racialism, class prejudice,
organized religion, provincialism, and  sexual roles,  Soviet Marxism in
power increasingly muted the expression of these ideals from the 1930s and

increasingly emphasized nationalist and even racialist themes as well as
mass identity and solidarity with party and working class or proletariat. The
former themes in  particular correspond to  persistent values in  Russian
society and facilitate the mass integration of the Soviet regime under the
hard managerial disciplines.
While the ideological differences between soft and hard managerialism
indicate significant differences in the functioning of the respective regimes
and in the psychic and behavioral patterns that characterize soft and hard
managerial elites, they  do  not  point  to  any  significant structural
differentiation between the two kinds of managerialism. Both the hard and
soft regimes are apparatuses of power in which mass organizations in state,
economy,  and  culture predominate  and  replace the  simpler and  smaller
organizations of the bourgeois and prescriptive orders. In both kinds of
regime, specially  trained managerial elites displace bourgeois and
prescriptive elites and operate and direct the fused state and economy in
accordance with their own interests and aspirations. The latter, in both the
hard and soft regimes, include the discrediting and overthrow of traditional
society, its elites, and its ideologies and institutions, as well as the fusion of
the state and economy, the rejection of individualist and particularist codes
and the assertion of collective values and institutions, the dematerialization
of  property,  the  centralization of  political functions in  a  managerial
bureaucracy,  the  alliance of  the  new  managerial elite  with  the  mass
population through managerial Caesarism, the conversion of the state to a
teleocratic and utopian order, and the ideological integration of the regime
through the inculcation of managerial ideologies in the mass population.
The  ideologies of  both  the  hard  and  soft  regimes share  the  elemental
formulas of scientism and utopianism and serve to rationalize the power and
pre-eminence of the managerial elite, the predominance of its regime, and

the  managerial control of  the  processes of  socialization. The  interests,
aspirations, and ideologies of both the hard and soft managerial elites arise
from  their  principal interest, the  continuing enhancement of  the
opportunities for and the power and rewards of applying managerial skills
to government, economy, thought and communications, and human society
in general. While the soft elites enhance their power and rewards through
the application of managerial skills to the continuing manipulation of social,
economic, and  political problems,  the  hard  elites  do  so  through the
application of managerial skills to coercion and conflict—in war against
external enemies and the extirpation of internal resistance, in the perfection
of the mass population of the martial virtues through affirmation of what
Mussolini called “holiness and  heroism,”
## [301]
and  in  the  indefinite
continuation of conflict and the use of force.
Moreover,  the  political movements  that  act  as  the  vanguards  of  the
managerial revolution in both the hard and soft regimes tend to attract a
considerable following from  the  lower  strata  of  the  bourgeoisie. The
Progressive movement in the United States gained the support of small
businessmen and  farmers who  sought to  reform the  corruptions of  the
bourgeois order. National Socialism in Germany also attracted the political
allegiance of the petty bourgeoisie, which sought the stabilization of its own
status  and  the  reform and  restoration of  the  German nation and  Reich.
Whether by design or force of circumstance, however, the political orders
that  came  into  being  with  the  support of  this  popular and  essentially
bourgeois base  quickly evolved  regimes that  developed managerial
structures with  interests and  dynamics in  conflict with  those  of  the
bourgeoisie and radically different from what the supportive petty bourgeois
elements had envisioned or desired.

The differences between the two kinds of managerial regime consist
primarily in  how  power is  acquired, preserved, and  utilized,  in  their
dynamics as  ruling elites, and  not  in  the  real  goals  of  power.  These
differences are due largely to the historical circumstances in which hard and
soft  managerialism respectively evolved. These  circumstances tended to
select into the emerging elites those psychic and behavioral patterns that
could meet the functional imperatives that each kind of regime exhibited.
Despite these differentiations, the fundamental structural parallels between
the hard and soft regimes raise the question of whether either kind can
metamorphose into the other. With regard to the National Socialist system,
the question is unanswerable, since the regime was destroyed in war and
replaced by a soft regime in the Federal Republic of Germany and by a hard
regime in the German Democratic Republic. In the Soviet Union, however,
there are indications that the hard regimes constructed by Lenin and his
successors may be transformed into soft regimes.

The Metamorphosis of Managerial
## Regimes
While the historical reasons for the differentiation into hard and soft
regimes in the early 20th century appear to be peculiar to the situations in
which these  regimes evolved,  the  existence of  two  different kinds  of
managerial regimes with  distinctive patterns of  behavior,  mentality,  and
ideology is of considerable importance. It shows that managerial elites are
not confined to a single psychological type or style of dominance, and it
suggests the possibility that either kind of regime may be transformed into
the other—not only that the hard regimes of the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe could be transformed into soft regimes but also that the soft elite
that  has  historically prevailed in  the  United States and  the  West  could
metamorphose into hard elites.
## [302]
The analysis of the differences between the two kinds of managerial
regimes in terms of the psychological composition of their elites suggests
that the metamorphosis of a hard or soft managerial regime would involve
the  replacement  of  its  incumbent elite  and  the  pattern of  psychic and
behavioral traits that prevail within it by a new elite characterized by a
different psychological composition. The precipitant of such a replacement
of elites and residues is generally a protracted social, economic, or political
crisis to which the component social forces and psychic residues of the
incumbent elite are unable to respond adequately. The availability of an
alternative elite in which alternative social forces and residues prevail that
are able to respond adequately to the societal challenge is also necessary for
a replacement of elites and a metamorphosis of the regime.

In the Soviet Union, such a crisis was provoked by the incipient collapse
of the Soviet economy in the 1980s, its inability to produce or distribute
adequate food and basic economic necessities to the mass population, and
the prospect of the national and global decline of the Soviet Union as a
world power because of its failure to keep pace with Western economic and
technological developments in the future. Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms in
the Soviet state and Communist Party and attendant changes in Eastern
Europe in 1989 and 1990 were the responses to this crisis by the hard
regime, and they raised the possibility that a soft regime, relying on the
manipulation of mass consumption and political and cultural participation,
was being constructed. The successful metamorphosis of the Soviet hard
regime may  require a  far  more  substantial economic base  for  the
development of mass consumption and mass culture than Soviet socialism
appeared able  to  generate, however,  as  well  as  considerably more
managerial and  technical skills  applied to  manipulative techniques of
dominance than the Soviet hard elite can easily acquire. The lack of such
skills  and  the  absence of  a  sufficient economic base  within the  present
Soviet system suggest that there exists no alternative elite available for the
replacement of the incumbent elite.
Moreover, Gorbachev’s reforms met with considerable resistance, not
only  from  the  hard  elite  of  the  Soviet party  and  state  but  also  from
nationalist and traditionalist forces that either feared continued Russian and
communist domination or which sought political and cultural expression of
their  own  aspirations. Some  of  these  forces appeared to  resemble the
frustrated hard managerial sub-elites of Weimar Germany and late czarist
Russia. Thus Walter  Laqueur cites  Soviet writer Mikhail Leontiev as
describing the Russian “New Right” as “fascist.” “The danger of a fascist
coup is growing daily in our country,” wrote Leontiev in the Riga weekly

## Atmoda,
inasmuch as the fascist consensus is not limited to exalted youngsters with swastikas on
their leather jackets, but includes representative elements of the creative and technical
intelligentsia and  strengthens its  influence in  the  political establishment (the  Party
apparatus, the army, and the security organs).
## [303]
The  practical effect  of  Gorbachev’s  retreat from  hard  managerial
techniques of mass discipline by force may simply be the replacement of a
delegitimized Marxist-Leninist ideology by a new hard managerial formula
centered around explicit nationalist, traditionalist, and  anti-Western, and
anti-Semitic themes. In  that  event, the  Soviet elite  might circulate
substantially from Communist Party incumbents to new, non-communist,
but no less hard managerial elements. In the absence of massive Soviet
economic development, however,  it  is  difficult  to  see  how  a  significant
displacement of the Soviet hard elite or an enduring metamorphosis from a
hard to a soft regime can take place.
If an economic renaissance is necessary for the metamorphosis of the
hard  regime into  a  soft  regime,  the  transformation of  soft  into  hard
managerialism may require a severe economic dislocation that impairs the
capacity of  the  soft  regime to  provide the  mass  consumption and
gratification by which the mass population is manipulated. As with the hard
managerial regime, however, the soft regime can be transformed only by the
displacement of its incumbent elite and its component Class I residues by a
new elite in which Class II residues prevail, and the precipitants of the
transformation must involve a crisis of or protracted challenge to the regime
to which the component social forces and psychic residues of the incumbent
elite are unable to respond adequately. In Pareto’s model of elite circulation,
“lions” replace “foxes” by  taking advantage of  their  characteristic
vulnerabilities. According to  this  model, Class  II  residues, as  they  are

excluded from an elite in which Class I residues prevail, tend to accumulate
in  the  sub-elites  and  mass  population and  eventually and  increasingly
challenge the manipulative modes of power of the soft elite by their use of
force  and  their  formulation of  ideologies that  appeal to  force  and  its
correlates of asceticism and group solidarity. This polarization of residues,
with those of one class concentrated in the elite and those of the other class
accumulating in the subordinate population, is itself a destabilizing force in
any social order and generates social and political conflict between the elite
and  non-elite. If  the  soft  regime  encounters challenges to  which its
dominant Class I residues and the manipulative techniques of dominance
associated with  them  cannot respond adequately,  then  the  accumulated
Class II residues of the subordinate strata of the population may emerge into
the elite in response to such challenges by mobilizing social forces that can
resolve the societal crisis but are unavailable to the soft elite. In the soft
managerial regime that prevails in the United States today, there are indeed
indications that  both  a  polarization of  residues between elite  and
subordinate strata  and  an  incipient circulation of  the  residues of  the
managerial elite  is  occurring. This  process indicates the  existence of  a
protracted crisis of the soft managerial regime that the incumbent elite is
unable to resolve, and the crisis manifests itself in a protracted struggle for
power on a political and social level.

## THE MANAGERIAL
## REVOLUTION
The Rise and Fall of the Bourgeois Order
The managerial revolution—the displacement of  the  bourgeois  and
entrepreneurial elite  as  the  nationally dominant minority in  American
political, economic, and  cultural  life  by  new  groups trained in  highly
specialized technical and administrative skills—was a protracted process
that  occupied most  of  the  first  half  of  the  20th  century.  Although the
characteristics of the transformation became increasingly clear during and
after its completion, at every point the distinctive features of the new elite
and the regime it was constructing were obscured by the persistence of
bourgeois habits of thought and behavior, by the necessity of the emerging
elite to compromise with the opposition of bourgeois social and political
forces, and by the mixture of managerial and bourgeois elements in the
period of transition. Nevertheless, by the end of World War II the character
of the new elite had become manifest. It had established its dominance
within the  mass  state,  the  mass  corporations and  unions, and  the  mass
organizations of culture and communications, and it had extended the scale
and power of these organizations throughout much of American society.
Moreover, by 1945, the different sectors of the elite had come to share a
common ideological framework that unified them as a cohesive formation
and effectively communicated and rationalized their interests as an elite.
The managerial revolution would not have been possible without the

revolution of mass and scale that began in the period before the new elite
emerged and continued throughout the period of its emergence. The rapid
enlargement of  population, the  scale  of  economic transactions, and  the
quantity and intensity of human interactions created strains that the more
compact scale  and  individualistic or  particularistic structures of  the
bourgeois order could not  accommodate, and  the  same  scientific,
technological, economic, and  organizational forces that  created this
enlargement also created the managerial skills that appeared to be able to
control these  new  dimensions of  human activity.  The  professional
application of these skills and the promotion of the groups that possessed
them at first occurred with the consent and support of the bourgeois elite,
and indeed professional managers usually originated within the bourgeois
strata of society. At a certain point in the process of adaptation, however,
managerial groups began to acquire interests different from those of the
bourgeois elite and came to depend upon the new colossalism of social
organizations for  their  economic rewards, social functions, status, and
power,  and  they  began also  to  become aware that  persistent bourgeois
institutions and values constrained their interests. At that point, managerial
elements began to differentiate themselves and their worldview from those
of the bourgeoisie, to accelerate the processes of organizational enlargement
and complexity for their own ends, and to pursue the political, economic,
and cultural implications of colossalism. The result was a struggle for social
power between the  emergent  managerial elite,  centered in  the  mass
organizations of the state, economy, and culture, on the one hand, and the
old  bourgeois  elite,  based  on  local  and legislative political  structures,
entrepreneurial firms, and small-scale cultural institutions, on the other, and
the eventual victory of the former group as a new, nationally dominant
minority that sought to articulate and impose a new regime and a new social

and cultural order.
Historian John  Lukacs dates  the  period that  he  calls  the  “Bourgeois
Interlude” in  American history from  1895  to  1955.
## [304]
## While Lukacs’s
measurement defines the era of the cultural hegemony of the bourgeois
elite, the duration of its political and economic dominance, from which its
cultural power derived, was  somewhat different. The  bourgeois  elite
acquired national dominance in the American Civil War and retained it until
the political, economic, and social consequences of the revolution of mass
and scale pushed it aside in the early 20th century. A convenient date for the
end of the bourgeois era in the United States is that of the initiation of the
New  Deal  in  1933,  although the  erosion of  bourgeois  power  in  the
economy, in social arrangements, and in culture was evident long before its
political overthrow. The cultural dominance of the bourgeois elite followed
its political and economic dominance by a generation, and the final stages
of  the  dispersion of  its  cultural  dominance were  delayed for  another
generation after the transition of political and economic power to the new
managerial elite.
Although bourgeois interests and ideas were influential in the American
Revolution of the 18th century and paralleled the democratic and industrial
revolutions that brought bourgeois groups to power in Western Europe at
the same time, they were restrained in the United States by the persistence
of a prescriptive regime and the power of aristocratic elites throughout the
early  19th  century,  principally  in  the  American South. The  Civil  War,
though not originally supported by northern businessmen, removed these
restraints and  enabled the  bourgeois  leadership of  northern business to
acquire virtually unchecked political and economic power on a national
scale.

If northern businessmen opposed war with the South before such a war had opened, once it
was under way they knew precisely how to make the most of it, and by 1863 a war boom
was in progress. The South had broken up the Union when northern votes had conquered
the planter aristocracy and captured control of the federal government. During the war the
spoils of that conquest were bestowed lavishly upon many manufacturers in the form of
lucrative contracts, cheap labor, high tariffs. . . . At the end of the war the South was
exhausted, prostrate,  her  economy shattered, many of  her  people homeless  and
impoverished. In the North there was a stronger concentration of capital and a sharper
incentive to industrial enterprise than had ever been found there before.
## [305]
“The American Civil War,” wrote economic historian Louis M. Hacker,
“turned out to be a revolution indeed. But its striking achievement was the
triumph of industrial capitalism.”
## [306]
The higher circles of the new elite, the
grand bourgeoisie that emerged from the Civil War, was centered mainly in
northern metropolitan centers and  rested its  power on  its  members’
ownership and  control of  large  and  growing industrial and  commercial
enterprises. On  a  smaller scale  of  wealth and  power,  however,  smaller
businessmen and  local  magnates, constituting a  high  and  a  petty
bourgeoisie, dominated communities, towns, cities, and states throughout
the nation by their economic resources, their social and cultural influence,
and their alliances with local political apparatuses.
Despite the dynamism of its economic achievements, the bourgeois elite
and  the  social  order  that  it  created  and  ruled  exhibited and  indeed was
rooted in a worldview that both motivated and restrained its dynamism. The
anti-social, atomistic, and “ruthless” individualism of the bourgeois era that
later  muckrakers and  social  critics attacked was  one  side  of  bourgeois
behavior, and its rationalization in the business ideologies of the time was
one  dimension of  its  worldview.  This  form  of  individualism, which
characterized some aspects of bourgeois ideology, was most influential in
the  period  of  consolidation of  bourgeois  power,  when  it  served as  a
rationalization of crystallized bourgeois interests and as a means of denying
legitimacy to  anti-bourgeois  ideas  and  values. In  less  extreme forms,

however,  bourgeois  individualism was  socially and  morally rooted and
derived from the “inner-worldly asceticism” that Max Weber attributed to
the Protestant capitalists of the early modern era. The type of individual
who exhibits this trait, writes Peter Berger,
is concerned with the affairs of this world, is pragmatic and geared to action, as against the
more contemplative or sensitive values. But he is also self-denying, prepared for “delayed
gratification,” as against someone who immediately spends all that he makes. As Weber
correctly pointed out, it is this “asceticism,” rather than acquisitiveness, that distinguishes
the modern entrepreneur from other types of economic actors. . . .
## [307]
The ascetic dimension of bourgeois individualism, largely identical to
David Riesman’s “inner-direction” and to Lukacs’s “interiority,” generated
a personal and social ethic of work and productivity that contributed to the
economic dynamism of the bourgeois era, but it was also manifested in the
social institutions that characterized the bourgeois order and through which
the bourgeois elite held power. As Weber remarked, the acceptance of this
ethic  facilitated  and  legitimized the  accumulation of  wealth but  did  not
condone hedonistic indulgences and displays of wealth. “In fact,” wrote
Weber, “the summum bonum of this ethic, the earning of more and more
money, combined with the strict avoidance of all spontaneous enjoyment of
life,  is  above all  completely devoid of  any  eudaemonistic, not  to  say
hedonistic, admixture,”
## [308]
and  the  ascetic qualities of  bourgeois
individualism were compatible with and led logically to certain social and
political institutions that tended to stabilize and discipline the bourgeois
order.  Because these  institutions  were  based  on  an  ascetic and  sociable
individuality, their scale was necessarily restricted to what individuals or
small  groups could  govern, and  they  could  not  survive in  identity or
integrity once  they  became too  large  for  individual, personal, or  family
control or  when they  became detached from  the  ethic  of  ascetic
individualism.

Control of the entrepreneurial firm, owned and operated by an individual
or partnership of individuals, transmitted to other individuals of the same
family through inheritance, and administered according to the productive
and pragmatic values of the bourgeois ethic, yielded both personal wealth
that could be translated into economic, social, and political power as well as
power within the  firm  and  over  the  external social  environment that  it
dominated. “The entrepreneurs who created the first large industrial firms
by building their own marketing or purchasing organizations,” writes Alfred
D.  Chandler, Jr., “continued to own and control their companies. They made
the final decisions about the basic policies of operations and strategies of
growth and allocated the resources necessary to carry out these plans.”
## [309]
The personal wealth derived from ownership was fundamental to bourgeois
political power.
The entrepreneurial enterprise had, in turn, the ability to deploy financial resources for
political ends that reflected its advantage. The entrepreneur united in his own person the
right to receive and dispose of the revenues of the enterprise. So revenues were at his
command for purchase of votes, legislators or legislative action. . . . It was assumed that
congressmen and senators would be the spokesmen, paid or otherwise, of the individual
firms of their states or districts.
## [310]
Control of the small town or community, integrated through adherence
to  bourgeois  values and  in  which  a  locally based  bourgeois  elite  could
predominate through personal and social status and connections, yielded
local political power as well as a base for congressional influence at the
national level.  As  Daniel Bell  noted, in  discussing the  family-based
capitalism of the bourgeois era,
The family system had a social counterpart as well:    the domination, by the leading family,
of the towns in which the family enterprise resided, and, since most industrial enterprises,
at least in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, were located in river-valley
areas, the stratification had a topographical correlate as well:    the workers lived in the
valley because the factory was located there, and the family owners lived “on the hill”
because it had the commanding view.
## [311]

Small churches, schools, and newspapers, the clergy, faculty, and staff of
which were themselves reflective of bourgeois values or dependent on local
bourgeois  elites, reinforced and  generalized the  bourgeois  ethic  as
institutions of  culture and  communication. The  bourgeois  family itself
reflected the  ascetic character of  bourgeois  individualism through its
rigorous sexual mores, its strictly defined sexual roles, its small nuclear
structure and scale, and its external symbolization in the privately owned
home; and the family served the bourgeois elite not only as a reinforcement
of its ethic and worldview but also as an instrument of social power through
the preservation, accumulation, and transmission of wealth and status.
The kinship and class bonds, based on the nuclear family and the hard
property and social status of the family, encouraged the development of a
racial consciousness among bourgeois elements by prohibiting exogamous
and  interracial breeding and  intimacy on  the  part  of  the  elite  and  its
adherents. Although the  bourgeoisie had  generally supported the
emancipation of  Negroes in  the Civil  War,  the  massive infusion of
immigrants into the northern United States in the late 19th and early 20th
century (encouraged by  bourgeois  economic interests) threatened to
overwhelm the  bourgeois  ethic  and  its  institutional base  with  cultural
fragments alien to and incompatible with it and to inundate the conubium or
“breeding pool” of the elite and thereby jeopardize the transmission of its
ethic and institutions. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, nativist,
white supremacist, and anti-Semitic ideologies became popular among the
bourgeois  elite,  which excluded Jews  from  its  clubs  and  schools,
sympathized with  the  racialist theories of Madison Grant  and Lothrop
Stoddard, and eventually restricted immigration.
Despite its economic dynamism and what John E.  Sawyer called “the

institutionalization of innovation, risk-taking, change and growth,”
## [312]
then,
the  ascetic and  socially rooted character of  bourgeois  individuality
generated a  highly structured, often  hierarchical, particularistic, racially
exclusive, disciplined, localized, and personalized institutional fabric; and
the material interests of the bourgeois elite, the social power of which rested
in this fabric, as well as its personality type, ideology, and ethic, worked to
preserve the fabric against erosion and challenge. Although economic and
social changes created by bourgeois capitalism produced the revolution of
mass and scale, under the impact of which the individualistic and limited
scale of bourgeois institutions began to collapse, neither the bourgeois order
nor the regime by which its elite held power could adapt to or assimilate
these changes without the eventual destruction of their distinctive character.
Basing its power on relatively small, local, and personal structures that
could be directed and controlled on an individual or family basis and which
the  ascetic individualism of  the  bourgeois  ethic  could  discipline and
integrate, the bourgeois elite    did not depend on the formal apparatus of
government. It  typically regarded the  state  with  apprehension,  as  an
instrument once  used  by  dynastic  and  prescriptive elites  to  frustrate
bourgeois  aspirations and  as  a  potential instrument of  lower  class  anti-
bourgeois  interests. Its  principal political concern was  to  limit  the  size,
functions, expenses, and power of the state, and its political ideologies of
classical liberalism, strict constitutionalism, and the Social Darwinism of
Herbert Spencer and William Graham Sumner,  among others, were
formulas for the rationalization of a minimal, neutralist, and nomocratic
government that reflected bourgeois interests.
Bourgeois practice, however, was by no means entirely consistent with
the laissez-faire  and  minimalist state  advocated by  such  ideologies.

Entrepreneurial businessmen often made use of government at local, state,
and national levels to enforce policies and enact laws that protected and
furthered their  economic interests.  In  the American Civil  War,  wrote
Hacker, “The industrial capitalists, through their political spokesmen, the
Republicans, had  succeeded in  capturing the  state  and  using  it  as  an
instrument to  strengthen their  economic position” through  legislation
governing the  financing of  the  war,  the  disposal of  public lands, the
development of  railroads, and  trade,  banking, immigration, and  labor
policies, all  of  which served industrial interests.
## [313]
“The  businessman,”
writes Sidney Fine,  “saw  no  wrong in  government activities  that  were
conducive to his welfare: he did not ordinarily object to the use of state
power to promote business welfare. He tended to become an opponent of
the state only when it sought to regulate his economic endeavors or to cater
to  the  needs  of  other  economic  groups.”
## [314]
This  discrepancy  between
bourgeois theory and practice was never resolved and represented a serious
vulnerability of  bourgeois  ideological defenses that  later  Progressivist
critics such as Charles Beard, among others, would criticize.
Bourgeois political power, resting on local, private, and social bases,
was located at the national level in the Congress rather than the executive
branch, although  most  presidential aspirants in  the  late  19th  century
generally reflected and represented bourgeois values and interests. By the
1880s, the  U.S.    Senate was  known  as  the  “Millionaires’  Club,” and  its
members of outstanding wealth “constituted a ruling clique that through the
committee system of legislation controlled every bill that tried to run the
gauntlet of the Senate.”
## [315]
By allying with local political machines in the
cities, the bourgeois elite could prevent the use of government by anti-
bourgeois forces.
The “boss” was the businessman in politics, the man who set the prices for special favors,

sold the franchises, and guaranteed a controlled electorate. He was the man who made it
possible to conduct government in the interest of the upper middle class in spite of a great
lower-class electorate.
## [316]
The  localism  of  bourgeois  political interests and  their  avoidance of
issues  that  could  unify  and  mobilize mass  political movements under  a
national leader encouraged a  fragmented political culture that  was
consistent with  congressional government and  its  subordination to  the
interests and beliefs of the bourgeois elite. “The safest generalization that
can be made about political alignments,” wrote historian John A. Garraty,
aside from the obvious sectional division, is that party preferences were more influenced
by  family tradition, religion, and  local  issues  of  the  moment than  by  the  policies or
pronouncements of statesmen and their organizations. Personalities were important.
## [317]
Rejecting ideologies that would justify enlargement of the formal and
legal apparatus of the state or increase its dependence on it, and using local
power bases  and  control of  Congress to  restrain the  activism of  the
government, the bourgeois elite, and especially the grand bourgeoisie, in the
1880s began to elaborate a number of social institutions that consolidated
its national dominance and in many respects emulated the prescriptive and
aristocratic institutions it had originally challenged. New entrepreneurial
wealth of the later 19th century was assimilated by the “old stock” patrician
elites of the northeast. E.  Digby Baltzell has described the 1880s as a period
when the grand bourgeois elite of “old stock” Anglo-Saxon patricians and
the new entrepreneurial capitalists combined to found resort towns, country
clubs, metropolitan clubs, preparatory schools, genealogical societies, and
the Social Register as oligarchic mechanisms by which the bourgeois elite
formed a distinct identity and sought to perpetuate its social and cultural
power on a national scale. The highest circles of the bourgeois elite became
“almost Jovian in their economic power,” write Thomas C.  Cochran and
## William Miller.

Mainly vigorous, self-made men still adding to their imperial domains, they were as yet
unhampered by incompetent relatives who later were to be installed in important places
simply because of family connections. By marrying their daughters to the impoverished
nobility of  Europe, however,  they  were  giving a  monarchic gloss  to  their  democratic
fortunes, and by intermarriage among themselves they were retaining the power of these
fortunes within the family ranks.
## [318]
Between 1874, when Jennie Jerome married Lord Randolph Churchill,
and 1909, more than 500 American women married titled Europeans, and
an  estimated  $220  million followed them  to  Europe, assisting in  the
creation of what Baltzell called “an international Victorian aristocracy.”
## [319]
Bourgeois philanthropy that endowed the institutions of higher culture also
contributed to bourgeois dominance of the cultural life of the era. “During
the Bourgeois Interlude,” writes Lukacs,
they [the bourgeois elite] began to devote a fair portion of their interests, and a more than
fair portion of their money, to the collection and the propagation of art. It was thus that the
Metropolitan Opera, Carnegie Hall,  the  great  American private collections, the  great
museums, and the great symphony orchestras came into being.
## [320]
Similarly the new elite “contributed money on an unprecedented scale”
to higher education, and  such  universities as  Duke, Stanford, Johns
Hopkins, Clark, Vanderbilt, Cornell, and  Tulane were  founded by
endowments from its higher circles.
## [321]
In the 1890s and 1900s the most
prominent preparatory schools were founded by members of the bourgeois
elite, and “these schools were largely preoccupied, during the first three
decades of this century, with assimilating the sons of America’s newly rich
Protestant tycoons.”
## [322]
Despite such efforts to secure and consolidate their cultural dominance,
the dynamic expansion of entrepreneurial capitalism created forces that the
bourgeois order could not accommodate. By patronizing and contributing to
education, the arts, and culture, the elite created the institutional locations
of an emerging intelligentsia that eventually challenged the ideology, ethics,

manners, and  social  fabric  on  which the  elite  based  its  dominance. By
consolidating its social, economic, and political power and by frustrating
the interests of lesser entrepreneurial and bourgeois forces as well as those
of the mass labor force, it made itself conspicuous through its arrogance and
extravagance, provided a  target  for  criticism, and  contributed to  the
formation of the Progressivist political base. By accelerating the revolution
of mass and scale, it encouraged the enlargement of the scale and quantity
of  human interaction beyond  the  capacity of  its  individually based
mechanisms to govern and beyond the capacity of its ethic and ideology to
discipline, and it created the opportunity and the need for new modes of
control more appropriate to the mass economy and society. In particular, the
expansion of  entrepreneurial firms  into  colossal, technologically and
organizationally complex corporate entities dependent on mass production
and distribution and large amounts of capital called into existence a new
managerial stratum that differentiated its interests and ideology from those
of the bourgeois elite. Similar enlargements of other bourgeois institutions
and environments created breakdowns that encouraged blatant corruption
and precipitated the emergence of managerial groups in the state and the
organizations of culture and communication that were specially equipped to
respond to  the  increasingly obvious crisis  and  incipient collapse of  the
bourgeois order.
The displacement of the bourgeois elite from effective control of the
firms it owned and the transition to managerial control was facilitated not
only by the need of large and complex firms for professional specialists
capable of operating them efficiently but also by the increasing dependence
of such organizations on massive capitalization by financial capitalists. The
latter  appointed  their  own  representatives to  attend to  their  investments
within the  firms  they  financed and  thus  promoted the  separation of  the

original owners from control of the enterprise. By the early 20th century,
many entrepreneurial industrialists “had succumbed to the more stringent
regulation of a few private bankers who had learned how to monopolize the
most important avenues to capital.”
Men  to  whom financial expediency was  always the  first  consideration, now  began  to
control the  strategy of  long-range planning  in  production and  service. This  change
gradually dulled the initiative of erstwhile American entrepreneurs and straitened their
inventive and organizing genius. It left them, when they remained as managers of plants
that  were  once  their  own,  simply bureaucrats in  huge  organizations, unable, without
consulting their financial superiors, to adopt new methods or to discard costly old ones in
plant operation or management.
## [323]
Moreover, financial capitalists and their representatives often lacked the
specialized knowledge and  skills  to  operate the  diverse firms  they
controlled, and, as Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., notes,
As  family-  and  financier-controlled enterprises grew  in  size  and  age,  they  became
managerial. Unless the owners or representatives of financial houses became full-time
career managers within the enterprise itself, they did not have the information, the time, or
the experience to play a dominant role in top-level decisions. . . . In time, the part-time
owners and financiers on the board normally looked on the enterprise in the same way as
did ordinary stockholders. It became a source of income and not a business to be managed.
Of necessity, they left current operations and future plans to the career administrators. In
many  industries and  sectors of  the  American economy,  managerial capitalism soon
replaced family or financial capitalism.
## [324]
The era of financial capitalism was thus a transitional phase between the
entrepreneurial economy of  the bourgeois  order  and  the  emergence  of
managerial capitalism. The  leading financial capitalists were  themselves
entrepreneurs who  owned and  operated their  financial houses, and  they
occupied the summit of the grand bourgeois elite; but by enlarging their
power at  the  expense of  the  entrepreneurial firms  and  encouraging
operation and  control by  specially trained, professional managers, they
helped to subvert the economic dominance of the bourgeois elite as well as
its independence and to assist the emergence of the new managerial order.

By  the  turn  of  the  century,  the  displacement of  the  bourgeois  or
entrepreneurial owners by managerial elements was already well advanced
and would accelerate throughout the 20th century. “In 1900,” writes Robert
## Heilbroner,
half the top executives of the biggest corporations had followed paths to the top that could
be  described as  “entrepreneurial” or  “capitalist”—that is,  half  had  built  their  own
businesses or had risked their own capital as the means to business preeminence. By 1925,
only a third of the top corporate executives had followed this path, and in 1960, less than 3
percent had done so. More and more, the route to success lay through professional skills,
whether in law or engineering or science, or in the patient ascent of the corporate ladder.
Significantly, there was a visible change as well as a marked change in the educational
background of the top corporate officials. As recently as the 1920s, a majority of the
topmost corporate leaders had not gone to college; today [1975] over 85 percent have
college degrees and 40 percent hold graduate degrees.
## [325]
The first two decades of the century were decisive in the displacement
of the bourgeois elite from the control of corporate business.
At the beginning of this century the American economic system still included elements of
financial and family capitalism. Managerial capitalism was not yet fully dominant. . . . But
by 1917 representatives of an entrepreneurial family or a banking house almost never took
part in middle management decisions on prices, output, deliveries, wages, and employment
required in  the  coordinating of  current flows. Even  in  top  management decisions
concerning the allocation of resources, their power remained essentially negative. They
could say no, but unless they themselves were trained managers with long experience in
the same industry and even the same company, they had neither the information nor the
experience to propose positive alternative sources of action.
## [326]
Early managerial leaders of business, like the early and major exponents
of managerial liberalism and the political leaders of the managerial state,
were themselves usually bourgeois in social origin, if not from the higher
circles of  the  bourgeois  elite.  In  the  half  century that  followed their
emergence  in  the  mass  corporations, however,  managerial forces would
acquire economic and political interests contrary to and incompatible with
those of the bourgeois elite as well as an ideology and ethic that regarded
those  of  the  bourgeois  order  as  obsolescent, inefficient, repugnant, and
dangerous constraints on  the  application of  managerial skills  to  social

arrangements. Despite its bourgeois origins, then, the emerging managerial
elite would differentiate itself from the elite of the bourgeois order and
evolve into a distinct and antagonistic force.
The  political structure of  the  managerial regime and  its  ideological
rationalization in Progressivist thought also were fostered by bourgeois and
grand  bourgeois  elements that  were  becoming dependent on  managerial
capitalism. The  “New  Nationalism” articulated by  Herbert Croly,
expounded by Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, and adopted by major leaders
of large financial and managerial corporations in the early 20th century, was
an early version of managerial ideology. The fusion of state and economy,
the central feature of the managerial political regime, was encouraged by
organizations such  as  the National Civic  Federation, the Committee for
Economic Development, and  the Business Council, supported by  large
corporations and their leading executives and managers who depended on
the dematerialized property of the mass economy and the assistance of the
central state. “With the rise of the great corporation,” write Leonard and
Mark Silk, “the concept of property had itself been drastically modified,
with  a  widening diffusion of  ownership and  control both  through stock
ownership and through the political process and governmental rules and
regulations.”
From around the turn of the century, a few leading business executives, such as Elbert
Gary, chairman of the board of U.S.    Steel; George W. Perkins, “Secretary of State” for the
House of Morgan; the formidable J.P.  Morgan himself, and Frank A.   Vanderlip of the
National City Bank of New York, began to stress the importance for business of working
more closely with government and the political leadership, as well as with other organized
groups in the community, rather than imperiling the corporations’ position by standing in
endless opposition to them.
These corporate magnates and financial moguls of the Northeast felt that mustering greater
political support would be vital if big business were to avoid being hamstrung or even
destroyed by  politicians representing smaller  banks, businesses, farmers, and  regional
interests in other parts of the country. . . . The eastern tycoons and financiers sought to
recast themselves as civic benefactors, as corporate builders with a conscience, as practical

fellows who believed in social and economic reform and could make reform work.
## [327]
The theoretical basis of Progressivist thought was also developed largely
by bourgeois intellectuals—William James, John Dewey, Charles Beard,
Oliver Wendell  Holmes, Lester F.  Ward, Charles H.   Cooley,  and  the
Protestant clerical leaders of the Social Gospel movement—who formulated
an “environmentalist relativism” that “assumed the malleability of human
nature which was capable of responding to improved social conditions” and
“had a great influence on social reform throughout the twentieth century,
especially in breaking down the Anglo-Saxon’s convictions of his natural
right to rule.”
## [328]
Whatever the purposes and motivations of the bourgeois
originators of  the  fusion of  state  and  economy and  the  ideology that
rationalized it  and  challenged the  foundations of  their  own  regime, the
implications of their policies and ideas were formulated into an ideological
vehicle that served the interests and aspirations of managerial forces in the
economy, the state, and the culture.
The bourgeois elite in the early 20th century was divided, in its response
to mass society and its managerial re-organization, in what Baltzell calls “a
kind of schizophrenia of the [Protestant bourgeois] establishment.”
## [329]
## The
division within the higher circles of the elite did not become apparent until
Franklin Roosevelt’s  controversial policies of  the  New  Deal  era,  which
advanced managerial interests and ideas in clear opposition to traditional
bourgeois beliefs, but the schism was evident much earlier in the bourgeois
resistance to economic-political integration. As historian James Weinstein
explains,
In  the  industrial and  financial world a  polarization occurred between the  larger
corporations, railroads, and the various banks that financed them (particularly the House of
Morgan) on one side, and the small and middle-range manufactures and merchants on the
other. In general . . . the smaller businessmen were tied much more immediately to the
market than were many of the large corporations. . . . The smaller businessmen, organized
in  various  merchants associations and  in  the National Association  of  Manufacturers

(NAM), formed an  opposition from  the  right  to  the  new  liberalism that  developed  in
cooperation between political leaders such as Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft,
and  Woodrow  Wilson  and  financial and  corporation leaders in  the  National Civic
Federation (NCF) and other organizations.
## [330]
By the New Deal era, such resistance to the managerial regime had
extended to many grand bourgeois, who saw the antagonism between their
interests and  traditional values and  recent political trends, and  they
expressed their  opposition to  the  managerial regime in  the  American
Liberty League  and  in  the  eventual formation of  a  high  bourgeois
conservative political and ideological movement.
By  the  end  of  the Second World  War,  the  bourgeois  elite  had  been
effectively displaced from  its  position of  national dominance  and  was
reduced to  the  position of  a sub-elite within the  managerial  regime,
retaining control of fragments of social and political power that it could
mobilize to retard and restrain the regime, but unable to seize control of the
modes of social power. Yet the displacement of the bourgeois elite was not
the only consequence of the revolution of mass and scale and the emergence
of the managerial elite. The economic and social transformation effected by
organizational colossalism and managerial control of mass organizations
weakened not only bourgeois leadership but also the bourgeois order itself
as the social universe of the American middle classes. “More and more
Americans in the twenties,” write Cochran and Miller, “became aware for
the  first  time  of  their  complete  dependence upon  national and  even
international conditions far beyond their control.”
They became aware of their dependence upon decisions made without any consultation of
their needs by absentee managers meeting in places far distant from those where such
decisions would have effects. . . . In the twenties more Americans than ever before in our
history moved from the country to the city. The proportion of home owners declined;
tenancy increased in urban and rural areas alike; and urban mortgages skyrocketed leaving
many with nominal title to their property. . . . The cost of urban living rose steadily as
public services increased and functions once performed on the farm or in the cities by
independent individuals came more than ever before to be carried on by new municipal

bureaus or new public utilities.
## [331]
The transformation thus eroded the autonomy of the middle class by
undermining hard  property in  the  form  of  privately owned homes and
independently owned and operated businesses and farms, and it promoted
the  formation of  a  dispossessed post-bourgeois  proletariat in  mass
metropolitan conglomerations that themselves came under the managerial
direction of municipal bureaucracies. While the new proletariat retained its
middle-income status and  affluence, this  too  was  jeopardized by  the
economic collapse of 1929, in which, in Matthew Josephson’s words, “a
whole great class, between two and three million American families, were
being stripped of their wealth.”
## [332]
The return of affluence in the aftermath of World War II did not restore
the  economic independence of  the  middle classes, however,  since
entrepreneurial firms continued to decline and the new middle classes were
converted into office and professional workers within the mass structures of
managerial capitalism. “The  decline of  the  entrepreneurial class  can  be
shown in a number of ways,” writes sociologist Gerhard Lenski, “especially
in  the  United States,  where it  is  more  pronounced than  in  other  non-
Communist nations.”
In this country entrepreneurs dropped from 11.4 per cent of the labor force in 1870 to 6.0
per cent in 1954. The 1960 census revealed still further decline: during the preceding
decade, the  number of  self-employed proprietors in  construction, manufacturing,
transportation, communications, utilities, wholesale and retail trade, banking and finance,
insurance and real estate, and several lesser categories declined from 2.2 to 1.7 million, or
from 5.2 to 2.9 per cent of the male labor force. During the same period, the number of
salaried managers in these same industries increased from 1.6 to 2.3 million.
## [333]
In  1956,  the  number of  white-collar workers in  the  United States,
excluding the  service industries, for  the  first  time  in American history
exceeded the  number of  blue-collar workers.
## [334]
“For  them,” wrote

C.  Wright Mills in 1951,
as for wage-workers, America has become a nation of employees for whom independent
property is out of range. Labor markets, not control of property, determine their chances to
receive income, exercise power, enjoy prestige, learn and use skills.
## [335]
Although the post-bourgeois proletariat eventually regained its middle
income affluence after World War II, its independence and integrity as an
autonomous social  class  had  vanished, and  it  was  re-integrated into  the
homogenizing mass structures of the managerial regime as a collectivity of
factory and  office  workers, tenants in  mass  residential facilities, and
consumers of  the  managerial capitalist economy,  as  mass  voting  blocs
manipulated by the political mechanisms of the managerial state, and as a
mass audience disciplined by the uniform and unilateral signals of the mass
organizations of culture and communication.
Post-bourgeois  groups retained much  of  the  bourgeois  ideology and
ethic, though the skepticism, contempt, and ridicule that the managerial
intellectual and verbalist class in the mass media visited upon their beliefs
and  values as  philistine, backward, provincial, vicious, and  ignorant
effectively discredited and delegitimized the bourgeois worldview, which in
any  case  could  not  survive its  detachment from  increasingly moribund
bourgeois social institutions. The dislocations of the First and Second World
Wars and the mass affluence, consumption, and hedonism of the following
decades also contributed to the destruction of the bourgeois ethic, and the
bourgeois beliefs that persisted among post-bourgeois groups re-appeared in
deracinated or  abstracted forms that  lacked social and  cultural
reinforcements.
What Baltzell called the “urban-ethnic revolution” that accompanied the
political phase of the emergence of the managerial elite was a major solvent
of the bourgeois worldview and assisted the managerial subversion of its

institutional fabric. The  racial consciousness and  exclusivism of  the
bourgeois order reflected its particularism and its reliance on the nuclear
kinship group, and the Anglo-Saxon and northern European identity of the
bourgeois elite was an important dimension of its social power. Both the
racial consciousness of the bourgeois order and the particularist structures
on which it was based were constraints on the development of the soft
managerial regime and  restricted its  cosmopolitan and  homogenizing
tendencies.
[T]he political reforms instituted by the New Deal in order to bring the nation as a whole
out of the Great Depression were, at the same time, strongly supported by the members of
racial and ethnic minority groups, the vast majority of whom were still to be found at the
lowest levels of the economic pyramid. The economic battle to liquidate the Depression
was fused with the minority battle to liquidate the heritage of slavery and the second-class
status of the hyphenated American. . . . Franklin Roosevelt became the hero, as Samuel
Lubell has put it, of the heterogeneous mass of new arrivals on the Urban Frontier.
## [336]
The coalescence of the political phase of the managerial revolution with
the “urban-ethnic revolution” intensified the environmentalist premises and
the cosmopolitan implications of managerial liberalism, and the managerial
effort  to  weaken the  institutions and  beliefs of  the  bourgeois  order
increasingly emphasized and was expressed in terms of the attack on its
racial identity and exclusiveness. The managerial state found among racial
minorities an important constituency for its social engineering policies and
the  environmentalist, meliorist, and  scientistic ideology that  rationalized
them, and the conjunction of these managerial ideological themes with a
hedonistic and  cosmopolitan ethic  in  the  messages disseminated  by  the
managerial intelligentsia in  the  mass  organizations of  culture and
communication encouraged the  delegitimization of  the  bourgeois
worldview and identity and served to replace them with the new orthodoxy
of managerial liberalism.
While the  affluence of  the  1950s  disguised the  erosion of  bourgeois

institutions and values by homogenizing the American population into what
one commentator called “one vast middle class,” able to participate in the
economy and  popular culture of  mass  consumption and  hedonistic
indulgence, the characteristic social institutions of the bourgeois order—its
ethic of ascetic individualism expressed in and reinforced by independent
businesses, small communities, and privately owned family homes—were
disappearing. In 1956 the average American family moved its residence
every four years, and the erosion of the bonds of the bourgeois nuclear
family was  revealed in  following decades by  the  rise  of  divorce rates,
abortions, voluntary childlessness, the physical abuse of wives and children,
venereal disease, and radical changes in sexual morality and sexual roles. In
Lukacs’s words,
The sense of personal authenticity and liberty, the desire for privacy, the cult of the family,
permanence of  residence, the  durability of  possessions, the  sense  of  security,  and  the
urbanity of  the  standards of  civilized life—all of  them  bourgeois  qualities—were
weakening.
## [337]
Yet despite the fall of the bourgeois elite and the disintegration of the
bourgeois order as a dominant way of life, individual bourgeois retained
considerable wealth and control of economic resources, political power, and
social and cultural influence and continued to resist managerial power in
political movements and  ideological vehicles. In  communities and  areas
beyond the reach of the mass economy and culture, bourgeois institutions
and the bourgeois worldview often survived and remained prevalent. These
bourgeois  fragments and  remnants were  the  principal obstacle to  the
consolidation and, later, the acceleration of the managerial regime from the
1930s through the 1960s. By the latter decade, however, their resistance
was  in  the  process  of  being  assimilated or  weakened by  managerial
political, economic, and  cultural energies,  and  already the  bourgeois
remnant in  its  political efforts  was  closely allied  with  and  increasingly

dependent on  a  new  social force  that  was  acquiring a  distinct and
independent identity. In the late 1960s this new force, based on the post-
bourgeois proletariat and incorporating new entrepreneurial economies and
technologies, began to crystallize in a political and social movement that
presented the most serious challenge to the soft managerial regime in its
history.

The Dominance of the Managerial Elite
While managerial groups had generally become dominant in the mass
corporations by  the  1920s and  the  mass  corporations themselves were
dominant in  the  national economy,  the  managerial stratum had  not  yet
emerged as a nationally dominant elite. In order to acquire that position,
managerial groups had  to  acquire dominance in  the  state  and  the  mass
organizations of  culture and  communication as  well  as  in  the  mass
economy,  and  their  dominance in  particular sectors had  to  be  fused  or
integrated. Only  such  fusion would enable the  economic, political, and
cultural elites to coordinate action and ideas that reflected their interests and
to establish their power over bourgeois groups. Furthermore, the managerial
elites  of  the  state,  economy,  and  culture had  to  acquire a  collective
consciousness of their unity through a shared ideology that communicated
and  rationalized  their  common identity and  interests in  distinction from
those of the bourgeois elite.
In the early 20th century, the enlargement of the organizations of culture
and communication enabled managerial elements to acquire control of these
mass structures, and new intellectual, cultural, and verbalist elites emerged
within them as a managerial intelligentsia that formulated and disseminated
the ideological rationalization of the new regime. In the state, however, the
emergence of  a  managerial elite  and  the  enlargement of  government
functions and power were more protracted than in the economy or the mass
cultural organizations because of the persistent power of bourgeois political
forces and the legal and political obstacles to government expansion that the
bourgeois elite had constructed. Hence, managerial attempts to control the

state and use it to acquire national dominance extended throughout the early
20th century and were finally successful only when the Depression, and
later the Second World War, created emergencies that allowed managerial
groups to gain political power.
The mass state, under managerial control, is the central institution of the
managerial regime,  however,  and  managerial groups cannot  acquire
dominance as an elite in its absence. It is through the fusion of state and
economy that the managerial groups of each sector acquire and perform the
functions that yield power, and political, administrative, and legal changes
in the bourgeois state were necessary for the continuing enlargement of
mass organizations and for the application of the specialized and technical
skills on which managerial functions in these organizations depended. The
managerial corporation requires fusion with the state in order to coordinate
mass  demand and  to  gain  legally  and  politically secured competitive
advantages against smaller and less powerful firms, as well as to overcome
the social and ideological constraints on its functioning that the bourgeois
order presents. The mass organizations of culture and communication and
their intelligentsia also require fusion with the state for their subsidization
as well as for legal protection against bourgeois censorship and for the
power and  status of  the  intelligentsia in  designing, managing, and
rationalizing the social engineering functions of  the  state.  Managerial
groups in the economy and the culture therefore had a strong interest in
acquiring control of the state and in enlarging its size and functions, and
they shared this interest with the emerging managerial bureaucracy in the
state itself and with political forces that sought to acquire and retain office
through the expansion of government functions and services.
Managerial dominance in  the  state,  then,  did  not  mean  merely  the

occupation and control of government in place of bourgeois occupation and
control but  also  the  conversion of  the  bourgeois  government into  a
managerial state. This conversion involved a revolution in the theory and
practice of government that consisted in (1) the enlargement of the scale,
functions, and powers of government; (2) the fusion of the state with the
mass organizations of the economy and of culture and communication; (3)
the performance of governmental functions by specially trained managerial
elements; (4) the conversion of the bourgeois constitutional (nomocratic)
state  to  a  managerial administrative, social  engineering, and therapeutic
(teleocratic) state; (5) the extension of the managerial functions of the state
into economic and social processes, which had hitherto been considered
private and beyond the legitimate bounds of government action, and the
coordination of these processes by the state; and (6) the alliance of the
managerial elite of the state with non-bourgeois working and lower class
(mass) strata against bourgeois interests and institutions under the meliorist,
utopian, and Caesarist formulas of managerial ideology. The control of the
state by managerial forces and its conversion into an instrument of their
interests and aspirations were thus clearly violative of the bourgeois theory
of a limited, neutralist government and were clearly in opposition to the
interests of the bourgeois elite that its political and economic ideologies
rationalized.
The role of the masses as a political base for the managerial state and its
elite  meant that  the  state  had  to  detach lower and  working class
constituencies from  the  bourgeois  social disciplines that  secured their
loyalty to bourgeois political leadership and to re-integrate them within the
disciplines of managerial structures as mass producers and consumers, mass
voting blocs, and a mass audience. Since the revolution of mass and scale
and periodic economic crises had already detached large parts of the mass

population from bourgeois institutions and had activated them in political
movements, the  coercive repression and  control of  such  forces was  not
practicable. Manipulative rather  than  coercive styles  of  dominance thus
became characteristic of the managerial state as well as of the managerial
economic and cultural structures. Indeed, the architects of the managerial
state  anticipated that  its  social  engineering functions eventually would
replace its  coercive functions. “They were  inclined to  believe  that  the
repressive functions of government would tend to diminish as time went on
and  that  its  positive, ameliorative functions would increase.”
## [338]
## The
necessity of disciplining an already high level of mass participation and the
use of mass political participation as a power base of the regime (not only
in the political apparatus of the state but also in the mass economy and
culture) thus  encouraged the  selection of  Class  I  residues  (foxes) as
prevalent in the managerial elite and intensified reliance on manipulative
rather than coercive disciplines.
Managerial elements in government emerged from and originally were
encouraged by  the  bourgeois  elite,  just  as  the  elite  also  encouraged the
formation of a managerial stratum in the large entrepreneurial firms that it
owned and  controlled. The  eventual differentiation of  these  managerial
groups from their bourgeois origin and their conflict with and displacement
of the bourgeois elite were not originally apparent to most of the bourgeois
elements that supported them. Thus, bourgeois interests in the late 19th
century often showed no reluctance to enlarge the scope of government
when it was consistent with their interests or served what they perceived as
a public need. Although the classical liberalism that served as bourgeois
ideology rationalized  a  minimal state  that  enforced contracts and  basic
criminal laws  and  supervised public defense and  foreign relations,
bourgeois practice in the 19th century often contradicted its precepts. The

contradiction was due to the fact that the bourgeois order was not founded
on or derived from classical liberal theory but rather that the theory was an
approximate justification of  bourgeois  interests and  that  these  interests
sometimes demanded that  the  ideology be  ignored. Entrepreneurial
capitalists in the 19th century often made use of their political influence to
secure their  economic interests in  the  form  of  tariffs,  corporate and
agricultural subsidies, land grants for railroads as well as for farmers and
settlers, and  regulation and  currency legislation that  benefited private
economic interests. Despite the contradictions between such practices and
the economic and political theory of classical liberalism, however, the uses
of the state by the bourgeois elite for its own interests did not significantly
enlarge the functions of government, extend its functions into social and
economic processes,  or  create a  bureaucracy for  social and  economic
management.
Yet  in  other  respects, bourgeois  support for  enlarged  government
functions, especially at  the  state  and  local  levels, helped to  create
elementary public structures for social and economic control. In the 1880s
and 1890s many state and municipal governments enacted legislation for
the regulation of railroads, public utilities, banks, and insurance companies,
as well as laws protective of the welfare of labor and of labor interests in
industrial disputes. They also provided for public education and libraries,
regulated housing and construction, enacted public health and sanitation
codes, established  public institutions for  criminals, the  insane and  the
feeble-minded, the  handicapped, orphans, and  paupers, and  passed
conservation measures.
## [339]
The occasion for such local expansion of public
functions was the general dislocation of bourgeois society that resulted from
the impact of the revolution of mass and scale. These legislative innovations
occurred in “a period of transition during which government officials were

confronted with  a  multitude of  new  problems occasioned by  the  rapid
industrialization and  urbanization of  the  country.”
## [340]
Although such
reforms were not large or far-reaching, they served as a precedent for more
extensive public functions in the early 20th century.
After  1900,  the  Progressive movement sought far  more  extensive
reforms in  local  and  state  governments by  measures that  augmented
municipal authority.  “Large-city life,”  wrote  George  E.   Mowry,  “almost
demanded a collectivist and planning point of view,”
## [341]
and Progressivist
reforms were aimed at the political machines of cities and states as well as
at their social and economic problems. New city charters in the first decade
of  the  new  century allowed for  home  rule,  public ownership, and  a
municipal civil service and permitted experimentation with and expansion
of municipal government. “By 1910 over a hundred major cities were using
either the commission or the manager type of government.”
## [342]
## Progressivist
social scientists devoted considerable thought and  research to  urban
problems and their reforms, and Progressivist political leaders and social
reformers instituted changes and campaigned for further reforms at higher
levels of government.
These reforms were resisted by entrepreneurial forces and their political
allies at state and local levels.
## [343]
Progressivist innovations interfered with
business autonomy and  operations, exposed and  challenged  political
corruption and influence, altered political relationships, and created local
managerial elites that were less dependent on bourgeois control. While the
practical achievement of such reforms was limited, and traditional elites
could  often  circumvent or  adapt  to  them,  both  the  successes and  the
frustrations of  local  and  state  reforms and  their  Progressivist sponsors
encouraged the latter to seek analogous measures at a national level.

In the early 20th century, a principal vehicle for the enlargement of the
federal government, the expansion of its power, and its conversion into a
managerial state was the National Civic Federation (NCF), an organization
founded in  1900  and  representing the  “politically conscious corporation
leaders at least until the United States entered the First World War.”
## [344]
These corporate leaders—financial capitalists as well as early managerial
executives of the mass corporations—took a positive view of labor unions,
promoted federal workmen’s compensation, supported public regulation of
utilities, and encouraged the development of “welfare capitalism” by the
sponsorship of  social and  welfare services for  the  labor  force  of  the
corporation. The NCF also developed proposals that were enacted in 1914
under  Woodrow Wilson  as  the  Federal Trade  Commission Act,  which
“established the   principle of   tripartite (business-labor-public)
representatives in  public affairs”  and  “was  organized in  three  nominal
divisions, representing business, labor, and an undefined public.”
## [345]
Business leaders were of central importance, but the leading trade unionists of the day
were members, as were professionals (particularly corporation lawyers), political leaders,
university presidents, newspaper publishers and editors, and leaders of conservative farm
organizations. Under a fairly rigid public ideology of free enterprise and the denial of class
interests, the corporation leaders in the Federation sought to establish an extra-political
system of  rationalization, conciliation,  and  reform based on  cooperation with
representatives of organized workers, farmers, academics, and reformers.
## [346]
The NCF thus provided a forum for the formulation of a Progressivist
ideology that  reflected the  interests of  mass  corporations and  for  the
dissemination of the ideology throughout the emerging managerial political,
economic, and intellectual and cultural elites.
The immediate and publicly stated objective of the reforms that the NCF
advocated was to forestall the more radical political efforts of socialists and
labor organizations, but its advocacy of an increased role of the state in the
economy and corporate social responsibility also reflected the interests of

the  mass  corporations against those of  the  smaller entrepreneurial
businessmen. The latter often operated on budgets that could not afford the
increased costs  that  unionism, corporate social  services, and  regulation
involved. Smaller entrepreneurial business interests therefore opposed the
work  of  the  NCF  and  were  represented principally in  the National
Association of Manufacturers (NAM), founded in 1895 and after 1902 a
powerful force in opposition to unionism and governmental intervention in
the economy.
Corporate leaders  of  the  NCF,  who  regarded the  small  business  and
entrepreneurial opposition to  their  proposals as  “anarchist,” were
instrumental in  mobilizing and  supporting Theodore Roosevelt’s  “New
Nationalism” in  the  campaign of  1912. Although Woodrow Wilson
espoused, under the label of the “New Freedom,” a different version of
Progressivist ideology that  envisioned a  “Jeffersonian” dissolution of
colossal, centralized concentrations of economic power by federal action, in
contrast to the cooperative and integrated relationship between the mass
corporations and  the  mass  state  advocated by  Roosevelt, Wilson’s
administration in fact adopted much of the New Nationalist program. Louis
Brandeis, a principal source for Wilson’s New Freedom ideology, adopted
the New Nationalist-NCF proposal for a strong federal trade commission
rather than  the  populist and  New  Freedom policy of  legal  and  fiscal
constraints on economic concentration, and Brandeis persuaded Wilson to
support the  establishment of  the FTC.  From  1914  Wilson  increasingly
“accepted almost entirely the New Nationalism’s solution for the regulation
of business by a powerful trade commission.”
## [347]
Wilson’s general abandonment of New Freedom ideas and his turn to the
New Nationalist policies was in part a political decision that reflected his

concern over  business opposition  to  his  administration as  a  result  of
economic depression in 1913-14. “In the spring of 1914,” writes Arthur
## S. Link,
The President embarked upon a campaign calculated to win the friendship of businessmen
and bankers and to ease the tension that had existed between the administration and the
business community. The accommodation of the anti-trust program to the desires of the
business world was the first step, along with Wilson’s repeated expressions of confidence
in and friendship for businessmen. . . . Wilson climaxed his little campaign to win the
friendship of the business classes by turning over control of the Federal Reserve Board, in
effect, to their representatives, as if he were trying to prove the sincerity of his recent
professions.
## [348]
The Federal Reserve Act, like the creation of the FTC in 1914, carried
forward the incipient fusion of state and economy in the transitional era
between bourgeois and managerial capitalism. Since the panic of 1907, the
financial and managerial leadership of the mass corporations in the NCF
gave “general support for proposals later to be embodied in the Federal
Reserve Act of 1914 for a currency based on assets, rather than government
bonds, and for greater centralization of banking,” and Victor Morawetz,
chairman of  the Atchison, Topeka  and  Santa  Fe  Railroad and  an  active
member of the NCF, in December, 1907 called for “‘intelligent control over
the credit situation through a board of leading bankers under government
supervision and control.’”
## [349]
“The entire banking reform movement,” writes Gabriel Kolko, “at all
crucial stages, was centralized in the hands of a few men who for years
were  linked, ideologically and  personally,  with  one  another.”
## [350]
## The
creation of  the  Federal Reserve System in  1913  allowed for  the
centralization of banking in New York City and the integration of financial-
managerial capitalism with the central government, at the expense of local,
regional, and smaller banking interests.
Until the passage of the Federal Reserve Act the relative power of New York in national

banking was declining, but from 1914 to 1935 it dominated American banking as it had
only in the 1890s. . . .
The Federal Reserve Act coordinated, if not centralized, the banking resources of the
nation to  an  unparalleled  degree. The  continual and  routine decisions of  New  York
banking, because of this situation, affected the entire banking system in a much more
important fashion than ever before. The presumably decentralized nature of the system
allowed the most powerful of the interlocked districts to make innumerable operational
decisions for the remainder.
## [351]
Wilson’s nomination in 1914 of Chicago banker Thomas D.  Jones and of
Paul M.   Warburg, partner in a major Wall Street banking house, to the
newly created Federal Reserve Board, allowed control of the system to pass
into the hands of the corporate financial and managerial elite. Although
Jones’s nomination failed in the Senate, Warburg’s was accepted, and the
New York banker was the main influence on the Board until his retirement
in 1918.
The  fusion of  state  and  economy was  further promoted through the
temporary coordination of business activities by the War Industries Board
(WIB) under Bernard Baruch in World War I. “The board,” writes Otis
## L. Graham, Jr.,
replaced the marketplace where large industry was concerned, utilizing persuasion and
mild  threats  to  gain  acceptable prices, adjustment of  competing claims for  scarce
resources, and priorities in military contracting. . . . What stuck with contemporaries, and
came down in memory, was a well-coordinated mobilization under government direction,
with the WIB as the nerve center. The experience left an indelible imprint upon the minds
of  important groups. Both  public managers  and  businessmen learned what  could  be
achieved, in  the  way  of  rapid  and  full  production, when  the  national economy was
conducted as a unit and directed toward agreed ends by the agencies of government. . . .
While it is impossible to estimate the impact of war mobilization upon the thinking of the
general public, we know that the experience was seminal for the American policy-making
elite. For the lawyers, businessmen, economists, social workers, statisticians, engineers,
and others who staffed the bustling mobilization agencies, World War I was a revelation in
the advantages of an economy managed through government-business cooperation.
## [352]
In the early 20th century, financial capitalists, themselves members of
the grand bourgeois elite and reflecting many of its values and interests, in

alliance with  managerial elements  that  were  emerging  in  the  mass
corporations, promoted the  fusion  of  state  and  economy for  their  own
economic and political interests. As the managerial elements displaced both
entrepreneurial and financial capitalists as the major forces in the national
economy,  they  and  the  mass  corporations they  controlled obtained the
benefits of the fused economic-political apparatus, and a managerial state
had already begun to emerge by the 1920s. The involvement of the state in
economic and social processes previously considered autonomous required
the  permanent presence of  professional experts within the  public
bureaucracy, and whatever private interests of big business were served by
the fusion of state and economy, the emerging managerial bureaucracy in
the state itself acquired an interest in enlarging and enhancing the scope of
governmental involvement and thereby its own power and rewards.
Both the financial capitalists and professional managers who promoted
the  early  efforts  at  fusing state  and  economy largely  originated in  the
bourgeois  strata  and  continued to  adhere to  much  of  the  bourgeois
worldview. Hence, their encouragement of the expansion of the functions of
the state, its fusion with the economy, and their rejection or modification of
bourgeois  individualism were  limited and  cautious, and  they  generally
advocated their  reforms in  terms  that  appeared to  be  compatible with
bourgeois  ideology.  Financial capitalists depended for  their  power and
wealth on their legal control of the capital with which the corporations
financed their operations, and as a social group they were not distinct from
the entrepreneurial and bourgeois elements they came to dominate. They
supported the  expansion of  the  state  and  the  modification of  bourgeois
economic and  political arrangements mainly as  a  means to  circumvent
radical attacks on  their  power and  to  consolidate their  own  power and
position. Although their actions in this regard were shortsighted and suggest

an attenuated understanding of and adherence to the bourgeois order and its
ideological and institutional dimensions, their fundamental interests did not
conflict with  bourgeois  institutions and  values. Managerial elements,
however,  depended on  their  own  acquired technical skills  and  the
application of  these  skills  to  the  direction and  operations of  the  mass
corporations, and not on the institutions and values of the bourgeois order,
and their interest in many respects involved their independence from and
resistance to  bourgeois  constraints. Hence, despite the  persistence of
bourgeois beliefs among managerial elements in the mass corporations, the
tendency of managerial groups in the economy was to detach themselves
from and to resist bourgeois interests and beliefs, including those of the
financial capitalists.
The early 20th century was thus a period of transition between bourgeois
and  managerial  capitalism in  which the  ideas,  values, institutions, and
interests of  the  two  different elites  were  mixed. While bourgeois  and
entrepreneurial elements continued to  profit  from  the  enlargement of
corporate operations and  continued to  rationalize them  in  terms of
bourgeois  individualism, they  lost  control of  them  to  the  ascendant
managerial elements.  While the  latter  continued to  adhere to  bourgeois
beliefs, these beliefs inadequately expressed their group interests, and they
gradually modified or rejected the bourgeois worldview in the development
and assertion of an ideology that reflected their interests. In the absence of a
catastrophic shock that would challenge managerial adherence to bourgeois
beliefs, however, the managerial elite in the mass corporations continued to
misconceive its identity and interests in bourgeois terms.
The decade between the end of the First World War and the beginning of
the great Depression was the terminal stage of the bourgeois order. The

apparent reversion to bourgeois individualism and laissez-faire policies in
the business-dominated governments of the decade, despite John Lukacs’s
description of the 1920s as the “zenith of the bourgeois period in American
history,” disguised the erosion of the integrity of the bourgeois worldview.
Thus,  Herbert Hoover,  Secretary  of  Commerce from  1921  to  1928  and
president from 1929 to 1933, encapsulated the transitional character of the
period. Trained as an engineer and experienced as an administrator, Hoover
exhibited the specialized skills and the proficiency in applying them to the
operation and control of mass organizations that distinguish the manager,
though he became for many, and thought of himself as, the personification
of  the  individualism  and  work  ethic  of  the  bourgeois  worldview. While
Hoover constantly appealed to such bourgeois values in his own articulation
of his beliefs, his policies at the Commerce Department and in the White
House reflected his acceptance of a partially fused political and economic
apparatus.
In the twenties, innumerable industries became partly monopolistic for the first time, and
the  government,  which had  heretofore frowned upon  all  organized efforts  to  “restrain
trade,” blessed the new order. The “Rugged Individualist” Herbert Hoover was the leading
sponsor of these cooperative activities in the twenties.
## [353]
Hoover converted the Commerce Department into an agency for the
assistance of  business interests through its  dissemination of  economic
information and its support for economic and scientific research, and while
he and large corporate interests were making the Department “virtually the
greatest trade association in the world they were also turning the Federal
Trade  Commission, after  1925,  into  a  research organization to  discover
ways in which business managers could cooperate more successfully.”
## [354]
The invocation of laissez-faire and bourgeois values in the 1920s by
managerial business executives was thus not an accurate representation of

their  beliefs  and  practices, and  the  dominant structures of  the  mass
economy directly depended on and were fused with the mass state to a far
larger degree than their smaller entrepreneurial predecessors. Moreover, the
rationalization of  capitalism began to  alter  in  the  1920s. The  common
rationalization for the priority of business interests in the decade was not
principally the bourgeois moral and social codes that centered on the work
ethic, deferred gratification, individual enterprise, and a limited, neutralist
state, but rather the appeal to prosperity, affluence, and success and the
business organizations and  techniques that  provided them. The  business
creed  therefore subtly changed  from  an  emphasis on  the  moralistic
bourgeois  value  of  deferred indulgence to  the  economic possibilities of
gratification, and since corporate and collective enterprise could provide the
latter, the individual ownership and control of enterprise lost much of its
rationalization and ceased to be the central ideal of the economic orthodoxy.
This change of emphasis reflected the emergence of mass consumption and
the hedonistic ethic as the ideological justification for the mass economy,
and it follows from this justification that when private interests are unable
to achieve the goals of mass affluence and gratification, other, non-private
agencies should do so. Despite the ascendancy and widespread acceptance
of business priority and dominance in the 1920s, then, both the practice and
the theory of business worked to erode further the institutions and values of
the  bourgeois  order  and  to  prepare for  a  more  complete transition to  a
managerial regime.
The  decisive transition to  managerial dominance occurred in  the
economic catastrophe of the Depression and in its political consequences in
the New Deal. The economic collapse discredited bourgeois economic and
political ideology on  a  mass  level  and  encouraged the  acceptance of
ideologies that more adequately expressed managerial interests. Through

the expansion of government in the New Deal, the managerial bureaucracy
of the state began to fuse with the managerial elite of the mass corporations,
and  the  latter  began to  differentiate itself  more  completely from
identification with the bourgeois order and the interests of the bourgeois
elite. The Depression fatally weakened the power of financial capitalists,
and  New  Deal  reforms assisted  the  emergence  of  mass  corporations as
distinctively managerial entities.
The fusion of the state and the economy that the New Deal implemented
was the central part of the managerial regime, but it was accomplished only
through the  alliance of  the  new  elite  with  a  Caesarist mass  political
movement that provided the political base for the expansion of the state,
infused managerial ideology into the regime as its formula of legitimacy,
and openly challenged the interests and worldview of the bourgeois elite.
The political and ideological dimensions of the managerial revolution thus
involved the participation of the managerial intelligentsia in the formulation
and dissemination of its ideological rationalization and in the design and
construction of  its  political and  administrative apparatus, and  the
intelligentsia committed the managerial regime to a permanent adversarial
relationship with bourgeois forces and institutions.
Despite the  strong opposition to  New  Deal  economic reforms  by
business forces and  the  detestation of  Franklin Roosevelt by  the  higher
circles of  the  bourgeois  elite,  significant sections of American  business
were supportive of the expanded state and its fusion with the economy.
These supportive elements were mainly concentrated at the highest levels of
the corporate managerial elite, while business opposition was centered in
entrepreneurial capitalists among smaller business enterprises, in  major
entrepreneurial business leaders such as Henry Ford and Pierre DuPont and

their  managerial satellites who  retained a  strong faith  in  bourgeois  and
entrepreneurial ideology, in specific sectors of the managerial economy that
for  particular reasons found their  interests jeopardized by  New  Deal
reforms, and  in  old-fashioned and  socially conservative elements of  the
grand bourgeois elite who despised what they took to be the socialist and
leveling direction  of  the  New  Deal.  Although business support for
Roosevelt’s  measures was  weak, it  eventually became the  mainstream
position of managerial capitalism, and the memory of the experience of
business in World War I was instrumental in gaining business support for
the New Deal.
Healthy profits had been made during the war period when business had been closely
controlled by  government, and  there  had  been  a  welcome degree of  standardization
introduced through the gentle coercion of the War Industries Board. Many businessmen
were impressed with the advantages of doing business under government supervision as
against competing in the chaos of the marketplace where reasonable cooperation was so
unlikely. . . . To some businessmen the problem of overproduction could not be solved
without government cartelization.
## [355]
Political scientist Thomas Ferguson has identified a section of American
business interests  that  was  supportive of  the  New  Deal  and  the
reconstruction of  the  bourgeois  social  order.  This  “multinational bloc,”
favoring lower tariffs, American economic aid to Europe, and conciliation
of  organized labor,  included capital-intensive rather  than  labor-intensive
industries, companies  such  as  Standard Oil  of  New  Jersey and  General
Electric that depended on trade with European markets, and international
banks. The  corporations that  composed this  “new  bloc”  were  in  the
vanguard of managerial capitalism and the construction of the managerial
regime:
The newer bloc included many of the largest, most rapidly growing corporations in the
economy. Recognized industry leaders with the most sophisticated managements, these
concerns embodied the norms of professionalism and scientific advance that in this period
fired  the  imagination  of  large  parts  of  American society.  The  largest  of  them  also
dominated major American foundations, which were coming to exercise major influence

not only on the climate of opinion but on the specific content of American public policy.
And, what might be termed the “multinational liberalism” of the internationalists was also
aided significantly by the spread of liberal Protestantism; by a newspaper stratification
process that brought the free trade organ of international finance, the New York Times, to
the  top;  by  the  growth of  capital-intensive network radio  in  the  dominant Eastern,
internationally oriented environment; and by the rise of major news magazines.
## [356]
Policy experts, lawyers, and  managers associated with  this  “bloc”
supported and strongly influenced such New Deal reform measures as the
Social Security Act, the NRA, the Wagner Act, free trade policies, and the
## Glass Steagall Act.
Perhaps the principal business leader who supported the New Deal and
gained support for  it  among managerial capitalists was  Gerard Swope,
chairman of General Electric, whose proposal in 1931 of the “Swope Plan,”
for  industrial recovery through the  cartelization of  the  economy in
partnership with the federal government, anticipated the general features of
the National Recovery Administration (NRA) of 1933-35. The legislation
authorizing the NRA, administered by Hugh Johnson, who had worked in
the WIB in World War I, was “a clear victory for the many prominent
businessmen who were backing cartelization as a solution to the nation’s
industrial problems. . . . The essence of the NIRA . . . was to place dominant
industrial trade associations in charge of a nation-wide restructuring of the
peacetime United States  economy.”
## [357]
Although the  NRA  was  declared
unconstitutional by  the  Supreme Court  in  1935  and  its  contribution to
economic recovery was  negligible, it  served the  interests of  the  large
managerial corporations at  the  expense of  smaller entrepreneurial firms.
“The larger corporations,” writes William Leuchtenburg, “which dominated
the  code  authorities used  their  powers to  stifle  competition, cut  back
production, and  reap  profits from  price-raising rather than  business
expansion.”
## [358]

A more enduring and less visible mechanism that promoted the fusion of
state and economy was the Business Council, founded in 1933 and chaired
by  Swope  as  a  semi-public institution that  represented the  corporate
managerial elite and was intended first “to marry corporate expertise to
federal power, and then serve as a long-range economic planning council
with primary responsibility for formulating industrial recovery strategy.”
## [359]
The Committee for Economic Development (CED), founded in 1942 by the
vice-chairman of the Business Council Paul Hoffman to develop economic
policy for the post-war period and to gain support among businessmen for a
cooperative relationship between government and business, was a similar
mechanism, and  both  groups  promoted the  acceptance of  a  strong
governmental role  in  the  economy and  the  modification or  rejection of
traditional bourgeois  and  entrepreneurial ideology.  In  1944  the  CED
published a statement that reflected the ideology of managerial capitalism
and its view of the economic role of government.
After  making all  the  usual  pious  comments about freedom, small  business,  and
marketplace competition, the CED declaration got down to cases. Three points were made
to assure federal leaders that realistic big businessmen were willing to recognize the “new
role  of  government”  in  the  key  areas  of  collective bargaining, fiscal  policy,  and  the
provision of social welfare services—a role made necessary by the fact that the 1930s
Depression had demonstrated that the self-regulating competitive market of Adam Smith
and the neoclassical economic tradition was a thing of the past.
## [360]
The  statement thus  implicitly acknowledged that  the  managerial
corporation and the mass economy in which it operated were distinct from
the  structures and  processes of  bourgeois  capitalism, that  the  mass
corporation was fused with and dependent on the state, which regulated and
maintained aggregate demand by its regulatory, labor, fiscal, and welfare
policies, and that the policies and ideology that served the interest of the
mass corporations and their elite were different from those that had served
the bourgeois elite.

At the same time that the corporate managerial elite was allying with the
state,  New  Deal  legislation began to  curtail the  continuing power of
financial capitalists over  the  mass  corporations. Bankers themselves, in
addition to the financial ruin they faced in the Depression, were discredited
in  public  opinion by  their  performance, and  the  Banking Act  of  1935
“marked a significant shift toward centralization of the banking system and
federal control of banking.” With its passage, Roosevelt “completed his
program of establishing government control over currency and credit.”
In the 1930s, the financial center of the nation shifted from Wall Street to Washington. . . .
The federal government had not only broken down the old separation of bank and state in
the Reserve system but had gone into the credit business itself in a wholesale fashion
under  the  aegis  of  the  RFC  [Reconstruction  Finance Corporation], the  Farm  Credit
Administration, and the housing agencies. Legislation in 1933 and 1934 had established
federal regulation of Wall Street for the first time. No longer could the New York Stock
Exchange operate as a private club free of national supervision. In 1935, Congress leveled
the  mammoth holding-company pyramids and  centralized yet  more  authority over  the
banking system in the federal government.
## [361]
With the collapse of financial capitalist power in the Depression, “the
enforced separation, by the New Deal measures, of investment and banking
functions, which  limited the  investment bankers’  control of  the  money
market,” and  the  ability of  mass  corporations to  finance their  own
expansion through earnings rather than borrowing, the mass corporations
and  their  managerial leadership became an  economic social force
independent from, and  inherently antagonistic to,  the  economic
organizations and system of the bourgeois elite.
## [362]
Corporate interests were not the only managerial forces that acquired
power in the New Deal era, however. Organized labor obtained collective
bargaining rights and federal recognition and assistance in the Wagner Act
of  1935,  and  mass  unions with  hundreds of  thousands of  members
developed almost immediately in 1936-37. The professional leadership and

infrastructures of the unions became managerial strata themselves, fused
through labor legislation and public bureaucracies with the mass state and
sharing power with  the  managerial corporations. Most  significantly,  the
state itself and its bureaucratic elite developed and extended their power
and managerial functions throughout the economy and society.
Under the New Deal, the federal government greatly extended its power over the economy.
By the end of the Roosevelt years, few questioned the right of the government to pay the
farmer millions in subsidies not to grow crops, to enter plants to conduct union elections,
to regulate business enterprises from utility companies to airlines, or even to compete
directly with business by generating and distributing hydroelectric power.
## [363]
In 1936-37 Roosevelt, acting on the recommendations of the Brownlow
Committee, sought the passage of legislation that would have re-organized
and consolidated the executive branch under presidential control and would
have allowed the use of the federal administrative apparatus for centralized
social and economic management. The legislation was considerably diluted
by  conservative  and  special-interest opposition in  the  Congress, and,  as
enacted, created only  the  Executive Office  of  the  President and  six
presidential assistants. While this  expansion of  executive administration
failed to establish centralized management immediately, it created a base
for the institutional enlargement of the presidency in the future.
## [364]
Institutional regularization of  presidential power in  a  routinized
executive bureaucracy was largely unnecessary during Roosevelt’s lifetime,
since his own Caesarist political style and charismatic leadership were able
to overcome political opposition and to govern effectively through officials
loyal to and dependent on his person.
The new agencies he set up gave a spirit of excitement to Washington that the routinized
old-line departments  could  never  have  achieved. The  President’s  refusal to  proceed
through channels, however vexing at times to his subordinates, resulted in a competition
not only among men but among ideas, and encouraged men to feel that their own beliefs
might win the day.
## [365]

Roosevelt’s personal penetration of established administrative authority
was paralleled by his direct appeal to a mass political following. “Roosevelt
dominated the front pages of the newspapers as no other President before or
since has done,” and he developed the presidential press conference as “a
device the President manipulated, disarmingly and adroitly, to win support
for his programs. It served too as a classroom to instruct the country in the
new economics and new politics,” and he “was the first president to master
the technique of reaching people directly over the radio.”
## [366]
For the first time for many Americans, the federal government became an institution that
was  directly  experienced. More  than  state  and  local  governments, it  came  to  be the
government, an agency directly concerned with their welfare. It was the source of their
relief payments; it taxed them directly for old age pensions; it even gave their children hot
lunches in school. . . .
Franklin Roosevelt personified the state as protector. It became commonplace to say that
people felt toward the President the kind of trust they would normally express for a warm
and understanding father who comforted them in their grief or safeguarded them from
harm.
## [367]
Of course, it was the economy, and not the government, that was the
ultimate source of the material benefits and services that the mass state
provided, and both the production and the public transfer and administration
of these services were made possible by the technical and managerial skills
that  came  to  predominate in  and  to  fuse  the  state  and  economy  in  this
period. By projection of his charismatic image and manipulation through
the mass media of communication, however, Roosevelt created the illusion
of his own benevolent omnipotence and infallibility and thereby assisted in
the  relocation of  mass  loyalties from  the  discredited and  shattered
intermediary institutions of the bourgeois order to his own person and to the
emerging  soft  managerial regime that  he  and  his  allies  among the
managerial elites constructed.
By  the  end  of World  War  II,  a  managerial elite  had  successfully

displaced bourgeois elements as a nationally dominant minority and had
transformed the federal government into a managerial state. The war itself
brought “a vast expansion of social intervention, administrative machinery
for the coordination of national military and production efforts, elaborate
institutions for data-gathering and forecasting, the dominance of relatively
specific national  goals,”
## [368]
and  while much of  this  apparatus was
dismantled at the end of the war, “the war cemented into American life the
broad interventionist role for government which had emerged fully during
the New Deal . . . And government’s evolution toward enhanced social
control only paralleled . . . the evolution of corporations.”
## [369]
The “enhanced social control” that mass organizations in the state and
economy,  as  well  as  in  culture  and communications, performed was
possible only because of the managerial and technical skills of the groups
that operated and directed these organizations, and the enlargement of mass
organizations, their fusion and interdependence, and their extension into
social and economic processes hitherto regarded as autonomous and private
served to enhance the power, rewards, and status of the new elite. The
control and  transformation of  the  state  by  managerial groups was
fundamental to their acquisition of dominance. While the intellectual and
verbalist classes generally supported the enlargement of the mass state and
obtained power from  its  transformation as  architects or  executors of  its
expanded functions or  as  the  recipients of  its  subsidies to  the  mass
educational organizations that  were  fused with  the  state,  corporate
managerial groups also by the end of the war were increasingly supportive
beneficiaries of it.
During the war they learned of the unique exhilaration of public service, and saw the many
potential uses  of  public  agencies in  rationalizing economic patterns and  expanding
production and consumption. . . . It was an educational experience for the elites of a
capitalist society, and in the end a politically moderating one.
## [370]

The control and transformation of the mass state by the managerial elites
of the economy, organizations of culture and communication, and the state
itself was made possible by their reliance on a Caesarist political movement
that broke through bourgeois resistance and allied with the underclass of the
bourgeois order to extend material and psychic benefits to it. Such benefits
were themselves made possible by the technical and managerial skills of the
elite and the functions these skills enabled them to perform. These functions
were principally manipulative rather than coercive, and reliance on them
tended to select into the new elite those elements of the population that
were  inclined toward manipulative styles of  behavior.  Reliance on
managerial functions and mass manipulation encouraged the conversion of
the minimal, neutralist, constitutionalist bourgeois state into a teleocratic
instrument that pursued specific social and economic goals, established the
dominance of the elites that directed it, and performed the functions by
which such  goals  were  sought.  The  new  regime and  the  functions it
performed were rationalized by an ideology that challenged the legitimacy
of the bourgeois worldview and justified the enlargement of the state into a
teleocratic agency that  sought to  transform the  social and  economic
environment.
To  be  sure,  the  dominance of  the  managerial elite  was  checked  by
persistent bourgeois power at the local and congressional levels, by the need
to  compromise with  such  power,  and  by  the  obfuscation of  managerial
interests and aspirations by the persistence of bourgeois habits of thought
among managerial elements. Nevertheless, by exploiting the dislocations of
the period from 1929 to 1945, managerial groups seized power in the state,
fused it with mass economic and cultural organizations under their control,
and  formed a  new  regime that  reflected and  enforced its  interests. The
dominance of  the  new  managerial elite  would not  have  been  possible,

however,  if  its  different components in  the  state,  economy,  and  mass
cultural and communicational structures had not developed a significant
degree of unity among themselves by which they were able to perceive their
common interests and form a collective identity that distinguished them
from the bourgeois elite they had challenged and displaced.

The Emergence of Managerial Unity
The Depression, the New Deal , and the Second World War served to
discredit and weaken the power of the bourgeois elite and its institutions
and  beliefs and  to  provide an  opportunity for  managerial forces in  the
economy and  the  state  to  displace the  bourgeois  elite  from  national
dominance. By allying or fusing with the emerging managerial bureaucracy
of the mass state, managerial groups in the mass corporations and unions, as
well as in the mass organizations of culture and communication, acquired
the  means to  make  their  interests  prevail over  those  of  bourgeois  and
entrepreneurial forces. In the same period the new managerial elites began
to acquire a collective unity through a common consciousness of similar
interests that facilitated their ability to act similarly with respect to them.
Managerial unity was the result of the dissemination among managerial
elements of a common ideology that communicated and rationalized their
interests in  a  coded  or  disguised  form,  and  this  common ideology was
managerial liberalism and the body of theoretical presuppositions on which
it rested. Although managerial elements in the corporations, the state, and
the mass organizations of culture and communication continued to conflict
over specific policies, and though the corporate elite in particular remained
skeptical or highly critical of the explicit policies of liberalism, by the end
of World War II almost all managerial groups shared the unacknowledged
assumptions of  managerial liberal ideology and  often  expressed vocal
support for  it.  The  common ideology of  the  managerial elite  not  only
worked to rationalize and communicate its interests but also to mute or
reconcile the  internal divergences of  the  elite  over  specific but

comparatively minor issues.
The  theoretical presuppositions of  managerial liberalism included  an
optimistic and environmentalist view of human nature that was logically
connected to  meliorist, cosmopolitan, relativist, and  scientistic ideas.  If
human beings were the product of their social environment, then many if
not all of the ancient evils of the human condition could be ameliorated or
removed. If bourgeois interests, institutions, ideas, and values were part of
the social environment, then their predominance was relative and no more
absolute than  alternative institutions and  codes  of  conduct. If  bourgeois
institutions and codes differentiated human beings into social and economic
classes, racial and sexual identities, local communities , and political and
national categories that constituted an artificial and corruptive environment,
then  emancipation from  them  would consist in  the  rejection of  such
differentiations and the affirmation of a cosmopolitan identity as “human
beings” abstracted from artificial social and cultural categories. The new
social sciences of the early 20th century expressed the theory of the role of
the social environment in forming and corrupting human beings and their
institutions and  values, and  it  was  through the  consideration  of  human
beings and  their  relationships  as  objects of  science and  through the
application of science to them and their problems that emancipation and
amelioration could be achieved. These explicit doctrines of liberalism were
largely congruent with the dynamic and interests of mass organizations and
their  elites  in  the  economy,  state,  and  culture, and  it  was  through the
application of  scientific managerial skills  in  such  structures  by  their
technically qualified elites that the goals of liberalism were to be realized.
Although the most explicit endorsement and far-reaching understanding
of the theoretical dimensions of liberalism appeared among the managerial

intelligentsia, and  although the  aggressive political expression of  liberal
ideology was  confined largely  to  activists and  reformers, its  theoretical
underpinnings enjoyed a much broader dissemination among managerial
elements that  did  not  always immediately perceive their  political
implications. The presuppositions of liberalism acquired adherents because
they appeared to serve the material interests and social and psychological
needs  of  managerial as  well  as  bourgeois  elements, and  only  when  the
political implications and functions of these presuppositions became clear
did the two major social forces begin to differentiate along ideological lines.
The  differentiation of  corporate  managers from  traditional bourgeois
businessmen and their acquisition of a distinct consciousness was present to
some extent in the National Civic Federation, whose members thought of
entrepreneurial capitalists who  resisted government regulation as
“anarchists.” In  1910 Charles Perkins, active in  the  NCF  and  later  a
strenuous exponent of  the  New  Nationalism of  Theodore Roosevelt,
expressed his and his colleagues’ sense of a new identity and explained
that the “officers of the great corporation instinctively lose sight of the interest of any one
individual and work for what is the broadest, most enduring interest of the many.” Their
situation at the “commanding heights” of American industrial life enabled them to view
matters “from the point of view of an intelligent, well-posted and fair arbiter.” What this
meant was  that  the  businessman was  merging  “into  the  public official.” “No  longer
controlled by the mere business view,” he was more and more acting “the part of the
statesman.”
## [371]
Perkins’s  renunciation of  individualism and  his  advocacy of  the
transformation of the corporate manager into a public official reflected a
differentiation of  managerial interests and  values from  those  of  the
bourgeois entrepreneur and an appreciation of the managerial interests of
collective organization and leadership and the fusion of the economic and
political orders.

The role of the NCF and the New Nationalism in developing a distinct
corporate managerial consciousness and identity that harmonized with those
of  managerial groups in  other  sectors was  intensified by  the  diffusion
among corporate  managers of  the  theoretical presuppositions, and
sometimes the explicit doctrines, of liberal ideology through the theories of
business reform that circulated in the early 20th century. The “scientific
management” of Frederick W.  Taylor, the “public relations” theories and
practices that underlay mass advertising, and the theory and practice of
“industrial sociology” were closely related, in  their  intellectual
development, to  the  main  currents and  assumptions of  the  Progressive
movement and  the  social  sciences  associated with  it.  While these  and
similar movements for the scientific improvement of business efficiency
had no overt political or public goals, their acceptance by early managerial
businessmen assisted the dissemination of Progressivist assumptions among
them and contributed to their ideological unification with other managerial
groups that expressed Progressivist premises and their implications more
explicitly. The psychological theory that underlay public relations and mass
advertising served especially to unify the corporate managerial elite with
the managerial intelligentsia, and the dependence of the mass corporations
on  the  mass  organizations of  culture and  communication for  the
manipulation of mass consumption and aggregate demand served to fuse
the economy and the mass culture in the emerging managerial regime.
The principal vehicles by which Progressivist ideas were disseminated
among corporate managers were the professional structures and media that
the new managerial stratum developed—the business schools, books, and
professional societies and journals that expounded new theories of business
management and  operations. The  increasing size,  complexity,  and
technicality of  business operations, which involved cost  accounting,

commercial law,  marketing, and  industrial organization as  well  as  the
scientific and technological disciplines, required specialized instruction and
the development of special forums for the exploration of business problems.
Professional associations of business specialists appeared in the early 20th
century and  published journals  and  sponsored conventions in  which the
technical problems of their new vocation were discussed. Thus, groups such
as  the  American Accounting Association, which developed from  the
American Association of  University Instructors in  Accounting, the
American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Association of
Industrial Management, and  similar organizations underwent various
incarnations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After World War I,
general managers  formed their  own  organizations, and  in  1925  the
American Management Association, “which quickly became the  leading
professional organization for  top  and  middle management in  American
business corporations,” was founded.
## [372]
Technical business education also
increased, and “in the decade after 1899, business education became part of
the  curriculum of  the  nation’s  most prestigious colleges and
universities.”
## [373]
The  “appurtenances of  professionalism—societies,
journals, university training, and specialized consultants”
developed in American industry, much as they had in railroading, to provide channels of
communication through which managers could review and discuss similar problems and
issues. And by providing communication and personal contact they helped to give the
corporate managers a sense of self-identification. By attending and participating in the
same meetings, by reading and writing for the same journals, and by having attended the
same type of college courses, these managers began to have a common outlook as well as
common interests and concerns.
## [374]
Among the most influential doctrines of business reform that contained
Progressivist assumptions was the “scientific management” developed by
Frederick W.  Taylor, whose book, Scientific Management (1911) exerted a
wide  influence among both  businessmen and  Progressivist reformers.

Taylor consulted with General Electric and DuPont on the development of
their managerial structures and lectured at the Harvard Business School. His
plan for re-organizing factories and industrial production involved a reform
of  the  environment of  work  for  the  purpose of  creating “a  short-cut to
increased production  and  industrial peace, and  a  plan  for  harmonizing
antagonistic interests in the factory through a better use of space, time, and
work.”
## [375]
“The significance of Taylorism,” writes Daniel Bell, “lies in its
attempt to enact a social physics,”
## [376]
and it thereby reflected the scientistic
and meliorist presuppositions of Progressivist thought.
“Taylorism” was  espoused by Louis  Brandeis and  became popular
among socialists, intellectuals, and proponents of the New Nationalism such
as  Herbert Croly and Walter  Lippmann  as  well  as  among corporate
managers.
Taylor’s  plan  .  .  .  would place  a  boundary of  science between corporate owners and
managers. The social terms of this separation would benefit the managers and prevent the
inefficient exploitation of factory labor. . . . To Brandeis, Taylorism was simply the transfer
of  scientific  and  sociological methodologies from  an  abstract academic setting to  the
practical problems of  factory management. As  in  science, methods of  organization,
classification, and experimentation could be applied to create rationalized work conditions.
. . . Scientific management demonstrated the possibilities of scientifically reordering social
relations inside the factory. It was a plan which aimed to reform management and to hasten
the final split between old-style laissez-faire capitalism and Industrial Democracy.
## [377]
By incorporating the environmentalism, meliorism, and scientism that
characterized Progressivist ideology, Taylorism assisted the differentiation
of corporate managers from entrepreneurial capitalists and the unification of
managerial groups as a distinct social force. “For a managerial class which
at the turn of the century had witnessed the erosion of its old justificatory
mystique of ‘natural rights’,” writes Bell, “the science of administration per
se provided a new foundation for its moral authority.”
## [378]
Similarly,  through the  sociological environmentalism of  Charles

H. Cooley, first president of the American Sociological Association,
the whole modern school of industrial sociology grew up in the 1930s and concentrated on
showing how the primary work group was the molder of human behavior and motivation
in the plant situation. It is important that this pioneering work in plant sociology which
began in the Western Electric works at Hawthorne, near Chicago, was led by Elton Mayo
and his colleagues at the Harvard Business School.
## [379]
The science of “public relations” as it was developed and applied in the
early  20th  century by  environmentalist psychologists also  served to
disseminate Progressivist assumptions throughout managerial groups in the
corporations. John B.  Watson’s school of behaviorism, by the end of the
## 1920s,
was not only the most fashionable school of psychology in this country but also became
the central theory of human nature upon which the great industry of advertising was being
built. . . . Faith in conditioning became the basis of social control in the new manipulative
society, composed of citizen comrades in the U.S.S.R. and citizen consumers in the U.S.A.
## [380]
The contributions of both Watson and Mayo reflected, in Bell’s words,
a change in the outlook of management, parallel to that which is occurring in the culture as
a whole, from authority to manipulation as a means of exercising dominion. . . . [T]he
older modes of overt coercion are now replaced by psychological persuasion.
## [381]
Watson’s ideas were closely connected to his hostility to the “traditional
arenas of socialization (e.g., the family)”
## [382]
and his desire to replace them
with the hedonistic disciplines of mass consumption within the framework
of managerial capitalism. As historian Stuart Ewen notes,
Painting a sordid picture of traditional home life, one in which “unscrupulous nurses” were
known to gratify infant wants by stroking, fondling and kissing their children, Watson
contended that such nurturing was injurious to the individual and society. Infantile sensual
pleasure was, he felt, bad preparation for the social reality of commercial and professional
life. Undercutting the home as an institution on which the child might rely, Watson led a
move toward accepting the industrial apparatus as a more proper authority. . . . Watson also
provided psychological avenues by  which home life  might be  supplanted by  the
stimulation of  the  senses—a direction toward which business in  its  advertising was
increasingly gravitating. Pleasure that could be achieved by the individual within the home
and  community was  attacked and  deemphasized, as  corporate enterprise formulated

commoditized sensual gratification.
## [383]
In 1922, Watson resigned from the faculty of Johns Hopkins to serve as
vice president of the advertising firm of J.  Walter Thompson, where his
theories could be applied on a practical and more profitable level.
Just as Franklin Roosevelt’s use of the presidency elicited from citizens
“the  kind  of  trust  they  would  normally express for  a  warm and
understanding father who comforted them in their grief or safeguarded them
from harm,” so the mass organizations of the economy and culture sought
to replicate the social functions of the family and relocate emotional and
psychic attachments  to  the  structures of  the  managerial regime, which
would be able to manipulate human personalities through its control of the
processes of  socialization. To  Watson,  the  hedonistic and  cosmopolitan
disciplines of mass organization were to replace bourgeois social and moral
institutions, and other experts in public relations expressed similar ideas.
“Treating all  people as  mechanically identical,”
## [384]
the  ideas  of Edward
Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, and Ivy Lee, who together developed
the science and profession of commercial public relations, were specifically
related to the problems of manipulative social control. “If we understand
the mechanisms and motives of the group mind,” wrote Bernays, “is it now
possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without
their knowing it.”
## [385]
The  ideas  and  reforms developed and  advocated by  Taylor,  Cooley,
Mayo, Watson, Bernays, and  others incorporated the  basic  meliorist,
cosmopolitan, hedonistic, and  scientistic presuppositions of  Progressivist
and  managerial liberal ideology,  and  their  dissemination among the
managerial elite  in  the  corporations through the  educational and
professional apparatus of corporate management served to unify it with the

similar elites of other mass organizations. The formal goals and values of
Progressivist ideology and managerial liberalism were consistent with the
collective material and political interests of managerial groups and assisted
them in the rationalization of their interests, but the ideology also identified
and communicated their interests in a coded or symbolic form as courses of
action necessary for the amelioration of society. Ideas for the Progressive
reform of business involved the belief that human behavior was a product
of the social environment and could be scientifically manipulated for its
amelioration (specifically, for more efficient corporate operations and the
more effective coordination of workers and consumers), and these ideas
implied a rejection of bourgeois institutions and values as constraints on
scientific and  managerial manipulation. The  economy of  managerial
capitalism, based on  homogenized  mass  production and  consumption,
required the  rejection of  bourgeois  social  particularism and  the  ascetic
individualist ethic  of  deferred gratification and  the  affirmation of
cosmopolitan values and a hedonistic ethic.
The control of the masses required that people, like the world they inhabited, assume the
character of  machinery—predictable and  without any  aspirations toward self-
determination. As  the  industrial machinery produced standardized goals, so  did  the
psychology of consumerization attempt to forge a notion of the “mass” as “practically
identical in all mental and social characteristics.”
## [386]
Emerging managerial elites in the mass state and the mass organizations
of culture and communication adhered to similar ideas and shared similar
interests and needs, and the diffusion of the presuppositions of managerial
liberalism among them as well as the corporate elite assisted the formation
of a shared consciousness and a distinct identity as a unified social force
with common interests and aspirations that were antagonistic to those of the
bourgeois elite. The resulting unity of managerial groups enabled them to
perceive their  common interests, moderated conflicts among them,  and

facilitated their emergence as a new and nationally dominant minority.
The diffusion of Progressivist ideas within the corporate elite and its
reliance on these ideas and on the managerial skills that developed from
them  also  assisted the  fusion of  the  mass  corporations with  the  mass
cultural and  communicational  organizations. Universities and  schools
provided instruction in business administration, the social sciences, and the
hard sciences, technology, and engineering that were necessary to perform
managerial functions. Professional  journals developed the  theory and
practice of  such  functions, and  mass  newspapers, periodicals, and
broadcasting applied the techniques of commercial advertising by which the
habits and  values of  mass  consumption and  a  hedonistic ethic  were
inculcated; and  these  media themselves became dependent on  the  mass
organizations of the economy.
## [387]
Nevertheless, the ideological differentiation of corporate managers was
not  complete, and  while  the  diffusion of  managerial ideas  assisted the
differentiation, the  persistence of  bourgeois  ideas  and  values prevented
many corporate managers from pursuing clearly the logic of their interests
and  ideology.  Thus, corporate managers and  many high  bourgeois
capitalists who  depended on  mass  corporations did  not  follow Gerard
Swope and other corporate liberals in their support of the New Deal reforms
and the fusion of state and economy, and they continued to invoke the
conventional ideas and  values of  laissez-faire, free  enterprise,
individualism, and  the  bourgeois  work  ethic.  Cultural inertia,  lack  of
interest on  the  part  of  businessmen in  innovative ideas  and  their
implications, and the continuing need to reassure stockholders, potential
investors, customers, and  the  public of  the  conformity of  corporate
management to bourgeois values, goals, and codes of deportment account

for much of the persistence of bourgeois and entrepreneurial themes in the
minds and  public expressions of  corporate managers. As  John  Kenneth
Galbraith suggests, the  “assertion of  competitive individualism by  the
corporate executive, to the extent that it is still encountered, is ceremonial,
traditional or  a  manifestation of  personal vanity and  capacity  for  self-
delusion,”
## [388]
and the material interests of corporate managers and the mass
organizations they direct demand an intense and continuous, if sometimes
unconscious and protracted, antagonism toward the actual institutions and
codes of bourgeois society and a gradual accommodation to the structures
and ideology of the soft managerial regime and the interests of other sectors
of the managerial elite.
The  same  body  of  ideas  that  the  managerial elite  of  the  mass
corporations accepted were common to other managerial groups, though
generally in a more overt political form that expressed their radical anti-
bourgeois  implications. The  activists and  politicians of  the  Progressive
Movement and the emerging managerial bureaucracy of the mass state in
the 1930s expressed most clearly the political implications of their ideology
and  thus  differentiated themselves from  the  political leadership and
institutions of the bourgeois state. “It is important to see,” writes E. Digby
## Baltzell,
that the New Deal’s efforts to change the economic and cultural environment, largely
through legislating greater equality of conditions between classes of men, were a reflection
of the whole intellectual climate of opinion at the time. In almost every area of intellectual
endeavor—in the theories of crime, in law, in religion, and in the arts—there was general
agreement as to the sickness of the bourgeois society and the need for environmental
reform.
## [389]
The  cultural and  intellectual meaning of  the  new  ideology  was
articulated by the new intellectual and verbalist classes that resided in the
mass organizations of  culture  and  communication—the expanded

universities and  schools of  the  mass educational system; the  mass
periodicals, newspapers, and  broadcasting industry; and  the  avant-garde
journals and forums that explicitly ridiculed and criticized bourgeois codes
and institutions. “By 1920, at the latest,” writes John Lukacs,
a new social phenomenon had arisen in the United States. This was the appearance of the
intelligentsia .  .  .  [which] regarded (or  at  least  it  thought that  it  regarded) anything
bourgeois as a kind of pest, to be shunned and avoided at all (verbal) costs. . . . By the
1920s their self-conscious urbanity had developed to an extent that they would proclaim
their distinctions from the rest of the middle class as sharply as possible.
## [390]
The enthusiasm of the intelligentsia for repudiating, embarrassing, and
discrediting bourgeois institutions and values—the small town, religiosity,
sexual morality, aesthetics, business practices, racial and nationalist beliefs,
and political ideas—contributed to the formation of tastes, values, ideas,
and styles that defined anti-bourgeois forces as “fashionable” (a popularized
version of  “progressive”) and  served to  unify  those  who  espoused
fashionable tastes and  styles against “philistine,” “repressive,” and
“backward” forces. While the  intellectual and  verbalist classes were
merciless to bourgeois Babbitts, entrepreneurial capitalism, and the ascetic
and  productive ethic  of  the bourgeois  order,  many were  far  more
sympathetic to the mass corporation and its new elite.
[I]ntellectuals could  see  a  new  kind  of  businessman emerging  in  reaction to  the  very
excesses of corporate behavior. As there was now a distinction between ownership and
control in business, so there were two kinds of businessmen. Collectivist intellectuals
based their optimism about the corporation on their perception that the managerial function
would ultimately dominate economic institutions, while the function of ownership would
continue to atrophy. Management, they felt, would welcome industrial reforms, especially
because this would achieve an efficient justice. Running a corporation required scientific
knowledge and the application of scientific principles, qualifications which would insure
the progressive character of managers. Thus the men who actually ran the corporations
could be convinced to act upon scientific premises.
## [391]
The hostility of the emerging managerial intelligentsia, located in and
dependent on the mass organizations of culture and communication, was

thus not directed at managerial elites in the corporation and state but at the
bourgeois order and its elite and at the persistence of bourgeois ideas and
values among managerial elements. The formulation of and adherence to a
new Progressivist worldview by the intellectuals and verbalist classes in the
early 20th century, and their popularization of Progressivist beliefs through
their manipulation of fashion and taste, served to establish a new public
orthodoxy that rejected and differentiated itself from bourgeois orthodoxy
and helped to unify those managerial groups in the state, economy, and
culture that  displayed interests  and  tendencies contrary to  those  of  the
bourgeois elite and found in anti-bourgeois ideology a rationalization of
their interests and a symbolic and disguised means of identifying them.
Adherence to the worldview of what became managerial liberalism served
also  to  moderate conflicts within  the  new  elite  and  to  solidify it  in  its
struggle to acquire national dominance and to challenge and delegitimize
the power of the bourgeois elite that it displaced. “Slowly at first, but with
increasing momentum in each decade after 1880,” writes Baltzell,
a naturalistic, urban, environmentalist, egalitarian, collectivist, and eventually Democratic
ethic finally undermined the Protestant, rural, hereditarian, opportunitarian, individualistic,
and  Republican ethic  which rationalized the  Natural Right  of  the  old-stock business-
gentleman’s rule in America between 1860 and 1929.
## [392]
Throughout the early decades of the 20th century, but especially in the
era of the Depression, the New Deal, and World War II, managerial groups
emerged as dominant in the mass organizations of the economy, the state,
and culture and communication, and they gradually evolved, through the
dissemination of and adherence to the ideology of managerial liberalism, a
unity and a consciousness of their distinctiveness as a social force, of their
common interests, and of their common antagonism to the bourgeois order
and its elite. By the end of World War II managerial groups in different
sectors had sufficiently integrated with each other, through the fusion of

state, economy, and mass cultural organizations, and had acquired sufficient
unity  to  establish their  collective dominance on  a  national scale.  The
political reforms  of  the  Progressive Era  and  the  New  Deal,  the
dissemination of Progressivist ideas and their theoretical presuppositions
throughout managerial strata, and the concentrated political, economic, and
cultural power that  mass  organizations and  managerial skills  could
mobilize, especially when fused in interdependent structures, toward the
pursuit of common goals were central to the acquisition of dominance and
unity by the managerial elite.
Having displaced the bourgeois elite from dominance, however, the new
elite encountered the problem of stabilizing and consolidating its power, a
problem that the death of its charismatic Caesarist leader and the ending of
the war and depression made acute. The managerial elite had to adapt its
dominance to the more normal conditions of peace and prosperity and to
institutionalize it in forms that were independent of personalities, particular
leaders, and social emergencies. The challenge of consolidation imposed
upon the new elite the necessity to modify its ideological defenses and the
policies and structures by which it had acquired power.

Democratic and Aristocratic Tendencies of
## Elites
By the end of World War II, managerial groups in the United States had
succeeded in establishing mass organizations by which they could displace
the  bourgeois elite  and  dominate mass  society.  In  the  economy,
managerially controlled mass corporations and unions replaced individually
owned and  operated firms  as  the  dominant structures. In  the  state,  the
election of 1932 returned to power an administration that sought to convert
the  bourgeois  government into  a  bureaucratic-managerial state,  and  the
onset of World War II encouraged the development of the mass state by
increasing its  size,  budget, personnel, and  range  of  functions and  by
securing the moral and emotional allegiance of the mass population to it.
The  managerial state  was  increasingly fused  with  the  structures of
managerial capitalism, was  controlled by  a  bureaucratic elite  led  by  a
Caesarist political figure in alliance with the mass population and in an
adversarial relationship to the bourgeois elite and its social and political
institutions, and  was  animated  and  rationalized by  a teleocratic and
melioristic ideology that expressed the interests of the managerial elite as a
whole. In the media of communication, mass organizations in the form of
mass universities, periodicals and newspapers, and broadcasting and film
provided structures by which the intellectual and verbalist class obtained
rewards from and provided vital educational and ideological services to the
managerial elite in the state and economy, and similar structures developed
in the churches and other mass organizations of culture and communication.
The  Second World  War  ,  with  its  far-reaching coordination of  diverse
sectors of  social, political, economic, and  intellectual life,  served to

integrate or fuse the managerial elites of state, economy, and culture, to
increase the need for their functions and services, and to establish them as a
unified and dominant group in American society.
The bourgeois elite, of course, did not disappear. It retained considerable
wealth through the  persistence  of  smaller but  often  highly lucrative
entrepreneurial firms under bourgeois control. It also retained considerable
political power at state and local levels and in the Congress, though it was
unable to coordinate its diversified and localized power bases effectively to
acquire national  power or  to  control the  presidency and  the  executive
bureaucracy. Hence, its political power was largely negative; it was able to
resist or modify the implementation of the managerial agenda, but it was
not  able  to  initiate  or  implement its  own  agenda. Culturally and
intellectually,  the  bourgeois  elite  increasingly lost  control of  the  larger
universities, foundations, churches, and newspapers and periodicals, and the
intelligentsia within them, and its ideology of entrepreneurial capitalism, a
neutralist and constitutionalist state, and a bourgeois ethic of socially rooted
individualism was increasingly criticized, discarded, and ridiculed by the
exponents of  managerial liberalism. Nevertheless, in  smaller colleges,
newspapers, and churches, bourgeois ideology often persisted and provided
for some parts of the mass population a credible and coherent perspective
by which managerial initiatives could be resisted and bourgeois resentments
against the new elite and its regime could be expressed. The retention of a
power base by the bourgeois groups in American society made possible a
continuing though  never  very  prospering struggle for  power within the
managerial regime between the remnants of the bourgeois elite (now largely
demoted to the status of a sub-elite) and the increasingly ascendant and
unified managerial elite.

The  continuing struggle for  power by  the  bourgeois  forces never
prospered because they  were  unable to  take  control of  the  dominant
managerial organizations that alone could discipline and accommodate the
mass  population and  its  interactions. The  individually operated and
controlled and locally based social forces of the bourgeois sub-elite were
simply unable to  function on  the  scale  and  with  the  efficiency of
managerially controlled organizations. Without the  managerial and
technical skills  necessary to  operate and  control mass  organizations,
bourgeois forces were unable to attract the mass following, generate and
organize the massive financial resources, or reformulate their ideology into
the more attractive and sophisticated forms that a successful power struggle
required. Moreover,  as  the  managerial elite  consolidated its  power,  the
financial and political rewards it offered tended to attract the most able and
aggressive elements  of  the  bourgeoisie into  its  ranks. By  acquiring and
professionally using  managerial  skills,  the  best  of  the  bourgeoisie were
assimilated into the managerial elite. The bourgeois elements that did not
acquire such skills and become assimilated tended to be the less competent,
the less aggressive and ambitious, and the more marginal members of the
bourgeois sub-elite, and the managerial ascendancy thus tended to reinforce
itself by the ability of the managerial regime to draw off and assimilate its
most challenging opponents.
The  persistence of  bourgeois  power as  an  oppositional but  largely
subordinate force  within the  managerial regime was  not  sufficient to
prevent the  effective consolidation of  power by  the  new  elite.  This
consolidation involved a modification of the ideology and behavior of the
managerial class that reflected its transition from a rising social force, in
opposition to the bourgeois order, to a unified and dominant elite. An elite
that has acquired power does not and cannot continue to think and act in the

same way that it did when it was seeking power.
Gaetano Mosca’s discussion of  what  he  called  the  “aristocratic” and
“democratic” tendencies in  elites  or  ruling classes in  many  respects
corresponds to the differences in behavior and ideology that distinguish
emerging elites from elites that have established their dominance. On the
one hand, Mosca noted, there is in ruling classes or elites a “democratic
tendency,”  “the  tendency to  replenish ruling  classes from  below,”
## [393]
to
recruit new members for the elite from social strata outside it. On the other
hand, there is also an “aristocratic tendency,” “of stabilizing political power
and social influence in certain families.”
## [394]
The democratic tendency, in
Mosca’s view,
is more likely to prevail in unsettled times, when new manners of thinking and feeling are
undermining the old concepts on which the structure of social rankings have been based,
when  scientific  and  technical progress have  created new  ways  of  making money  or
produced changes in military organization, or even when a shock from outside has forced a
nation to rally all the energies and capacities which, in quiet times, would have remained
in a potential state.
## [395]
In  the  absence of  such  “shocks” or  challenges to  an  elite  and  its
institutions and ideology, the aristocratic tendency prevails:
Everywhere, the moment the old barrier has been cast down a new one has been raised in
its place, perhaps lower at times and less bristling with brambles and thorns, but high
enough and hard enough to cross to offer fairly serious obstacles to anyone disposed to
leap over it. Everywhere, those who have reached the top rungs on the social ladder have
set up defenses for themselves and their children against those who also wished to climb.
## [396]
The tendency “to stabilize social control and political power” manifests
itself  in  a  number  of  ways  that  contrast with  the  manifestations of  the
“democratic tendency” that  is  associated with  a  rising  social force  or
emerging elite.
The  ideology of  an  emerging  elite  will  tend  to  be  skeptical and

confrontational, to challenge the ideas, values, and institutions of the old
elite openly and boldly, and to assert the value of change, innovation, and
progress. The ideology of the same social force, once it has acquired power,
will  tend  to  mute  its  skepticism  and  confrontational aspects and  to
emphasize consensus, legitimacy, the value of institutional continuity and
stability, and pride in the achievements of the new elite, which will adapt its
ideology to serve its new interests by seeking to legitimize and stabilize its
apparatus of power and its pursuit of its interests.
Similarly, an emerging elite will tend to make use of Caesarism and the
mass loyalties that a charismatic leader inspires to challenge the established
institutions of the incumbent elite, and it will make use of and ally with a
mass  political base  to  overcome the  resistance and  inertia of  the
incumbents. Once the emerging elite has established its power, however, it
will seek to institutionalize its dominance in more permanent and stable
forms  that  are  not  dependent on  a  charismatic leader,  and  it  will  tend
increasingly to  abandon or  modify  Caesarism as  a  tactic  in  favor  of
stabilized institutions under its own control.
Finally, an emerging elite will typically encourage new forces of social,
political, economic, and cultural dynamism. It will criticize the old elite for
failing to meet challenges, threats, and problems and for shrinking from
innovation and expansion. The emerging elite, depending on the resources
available to  it,  will  instigate economic growth, cultural and  scientific
progress, and territorial expansion in the form of exploration, colonization,
or imperialism. Once the emerging elite has established its power, however,
it will seek to stabilize its position and will tend to avoid challenges and to
become risk-aversive. It will seek to limit economic growth, will become
cautious and  skeptical toward  new  ideas  and  new  forms of  cultural

expression, and will incline toward withdrawal or isolationism rather than
toward expansionism. An elite that has established itself in power no longer
perceives an  interest in  encouraging innovation and  dynamism because
these  create new  opportunities for  rival  groups to  acquire power and
develop new resources, inventions, sources of wealth, and ideas that are not
under the control of the elite and may threaten its position. Perhaps the most
important and  most  general change  in  the  behavior of  an  elite  after  its
transition from  an  emergent  to  a  dominant position is  its  tendency to
constrain the development of new social forces that it does not control and
to limit the opportunities for such forces to obtain power and its rewards.
In short, the interest of a rising elite lies in breaking up the institutions,
ideologies, and social formations of an old elite that constitute obstacles to
its aspirations, but once it has succeeded in overcoming these obstacles and
has gained power as a new elite, its interest lies in consolidating, stabilizing,
and legitimizing its own institutions, ideologies, and social formations to
prevent new social forces from challenging its power or forcing it to share
power. In some respects the phase of consolidation into which new elites
enter  after  they  have  acquired dominance resembles the  “Thermidorean
reaction” noted by Crane Brinton as “a convalescence from the fever of
revolution” and which “comes as naturally to societies in revolution as an
ebbing tide.”
## [397]
In  an  extreme form,  if  the  aristocratic or  stabilizing
tendencies of  the  elite  continue,  they  may  eventually result  in  cultural,
social, economic,  and  political stagnation and  in  the  accumulation of
resentments and frustrations on the part of groups outside the elite that
cannot find satisfaction for their own interests and aspirations. Such groups
will then challenge the old elite and seek to replace it as a new dominant
minority. It is this process of replacement that Pareto called the “circulation
of elites.”

The early 20th century was clearly an “unsettled time” when new ideas,
scientific inventions, ways of making money, and methods of economic and
political organization were undermining the stability and integrity of the
bourgeois elite and its order and were creating opportunities for a rival
social force based on the control of managerial skill and mass organizations.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the bourgeois elite in the Western
world began to  exhibit signs  of  the  aristocratic tendency,  and  it  was
challenged by the rise of a new social force in the form of the emergent
managerial elite. By the end of World War II in the United States the new
social  force  had  established itself  as  a  new  elite,  and  its  interests now
consisted in “setting up defenses” for its new power and in preventing other
groups from dislodging or challenging it. The managerial elite itself then
began to exhibit the signs of the aristocratic tendency and to enter a phase
of legitimization, consolidation, and stabilization.
Yet the peculiar characteristics of the soft managerial elite cause it to
behave, even during its consolidation phase, in ways that are not commonly
found in most elites of the past. Unlike the elites of the prescriptive and
bourgeois orders, the managerial elite does not depend for its dominant
position on the transmission of power to its physical descendants. Kinship
bonds, whether of the extended kinship networks of prescriptive elites or of
the nuclear family of the bourgeois era, mean little to the soft managerial
elite because it cannot transmit the managerial and technical skills that are
the basis of its power to future generations, as members of prescriptive and
bourgeois elites could transmit noble status and hard property in land or
commercial wealth to their descendants. The managerial elite depends in
part on dematerialized property, which is essential to managerial capitalism,
and its members acquire status through “merit” (i.e., the ability to acquire
and make professional use of managerial skills) rather than through the

exercise and development of the bourgeois ethic and its productive virtues
or through hereditary lineage. For both prescriptive and bourgeois elites, the
aristocratic tendency involved efforts to ensure the transmission of power to
their  descendants. For  the  managerial elite  the  aristocratic tendency
involves inheritance on a relatively minor scale. What is far more important
for the managers is to perpetuate mass organizations, the operation and
control of which involve proficiency in managerial skills, as the structures
through which power in mass society is acquired and to prevent the rise of
alternative structures and social forces that might engender new forms of
power outside or opposed to managerial dominance. Thus, the managerial
elite supports policies that undermine the independence of localized and
small-scale bourgeois institutions and have the effect of stifling trends away
from mass organizations and reliance on managerial skills. As long as mass
organizations are dominant, the elite that operates and directs them will
itself be dominant.
Secondly,  unlike  most  elites  of  the  past,  the  managerial elite  is  not
concerned to limit its own size or restrict its membership. Indeed, the nature
of mass society and mass organization involves a continuing expansion in
organizational size and scale and therefore also a continuing expansion in
the  size  of  the  elite.  The  smaller scale  of  pre-managerial societies, the
scarcity of resources, and the limited availability of power restricted the
size of pre-managerial elites and created an interest on the part of their
members in excluding newcomers from access to their ranks and privileges.
Hence, in pre-managerial society, not only inheritance but also education,
taste,  manners, appearance, dress,  language, the  uses  of  leisure, and
comportment were significant means of demarcating members of the elite
from  the  non-elite and  in  excluding  the  latter  from  the  institutions and
rewards of the elite. Such oligarchical devices are far less important for the

managerial elite  (though they  do  exist
## [398]
)  and  in  fact  contradict its
professed standards of meritocracy, according to which inclusion in the elite
derives from proficiency in managerial skills and not from what it formally
regards as  the  irrelevant, superficial, and  obsolete mannerisms and
standards of  previous elites. Moreover,  the  capacity of  the  managerial
economy for  mass  production and  consumption removes the  factor  of
scarcity in  limiting the  size  of  the  elite.  Managers therefore have  little
interest in  restricting the  availability of  managerial expertise or  of  its
material and social rewards, and they in fact have an interest in expanding
their availability.
The managerial elite also differs from most elites of the past in that it
can  never  become a  genuinely conservative or  stabilizing force.  Unlike
landed elites, for  example, which possess a  strong vested interest in
preserving the status quo and resisting social change that would threaten the
value of their land or its social and political importance, the managerial elite
rests on innovation and its control. Thus, the bureaucracy of the state in
designing and implementing social engineering programs; the intelligentsia
of the mass organizations of culture and communication, which designs,
explains, debates, criticizes, and often assists in managing such programs;
and the “technostructure” of the managerial corporations, which promotes
change through  technological  innovation, mass production and
consumption, and  the  social  mobility and  ferment that  accompany and
characterize managerial capitalism, all acquire and preserve their power as
elites through the promotion and manipulation of innovation. The change
that the managerial elite promotes is not, however, open-ended or infinite. It
has  no  interest in  changes that  would jeopardize or  constrain mass
organizations and their functioning or would restrict its own power and
rewards. It  is  principally interested in  changes that  erode  the bourgeois

order and its remnants in the moral and cultural fabric, since the elimination
of the localized, private, individualized, and small-scale institutions and the
abandonment of  the  bourgeois ethic  assist the  functioning of  the
cosmopolitan, collective, public, and massive structures of the managerial
regime. Hence, there  are  limits  to  the  “open society,”  “progress,” and
“pluralism” that the regime promotes. Nevertheless, the dynamism of the
managerial regime, its  encouragement of  continuous and  perpetual
innovation consistent  with  the  interests of  its  elite  and  its  inability to
stabilize itself permanently, means that its phase of consolidation can be
only temporary. It may rest periodically, but sooner or later it must resume
the burden of innovation if its elite is to continue to obtain the rewards and
power that yield social and political dominance.
Finally, the elites of the soft managerial regimes tend to be composed of
Pareto’s Class I residues (foxes), and hence they tend to avoid the use of
force and its psychological and intellectual correlates in consolidating their
power and position and to rely instead on manipulative skills. All elites, of
course, make use of coercion to some extent, and the managerial elite of the
soft regimes has at its disposal an immense amount of police and military
power as well as the legal mechanisms and institutions of the state, which
ultimately rests  on  force. Nevertheless, whereas pre-managerial elites
composed of Class II residues (lions) often did not hesitate to consolidate
their power by the use of force—exile, imprisonment, torture, capital and
corporal punishment, the use of secret police and inquisitions, and military
suppression—the soft managerial elites have a disposition to consolidate
their power by manipulation—to discredit their rivals and opponents by
verbalist propaganda, to  deceive  them  and  their  potential supporters, to
negotiate or compromise with them, to co-opt and assimilate them within
the managerial regime, or to create legal and administrative barriers to their

ascendancy. Only in extreme situations, when opponents of the regime have
initiated violence on a scale or in a way that threatens it, will the soft
managerial elite resort to the use of force to suppress challenges.
These distinctive characteristics of the soft managerial elite mean that
the process by which it consolidates its power in several respects does not
resemble the process of consolidation that other kinds of elites exhibit. The
consolidation of  managerial power does  not  involve efforts  to  transmit
power, wealth, and status by inheritance or within a kinship bond, nor does
it ordinarily involve efforts to restrict the size of the elite, to identify it and
demarcate its membership by visible symbols, to resist social change in
general, or  to  suppress its  rivals  by  force.  The  ideology,  psychological
predispositions, and  structural interests of  the  managerial elite  tend  to
militate against the  use  of  such  devices and  mechanisms to  consolidate
power.  Instead, the  managerial elite  consolidates its  power  by  the
perpetuation of mass organizations and their meritocratic hierarchies and by
the systematic manipulation of its rivals and potential rivals, and this means
of consolidation is far more congruent with the psychology, beliefs, values,
and interests of the soft managerial elite than those used by older elites in
the past.
The managerial elite in the United States began to manifest the signs of
an “aristocratic tendency” in its own distinctive way in the post-World War
II era. The principal need of the elite in this period was to consolidate and
stabilize its predominance, to perpetuate and institutionalize its power and
the  mass  organizations on  which its  power rested, and  to  legitimize its
power with  an  ideology that  reflected its  dominant position and  was
credible to the mass population. In virtually every respect—intellectually
and  culturally,  politically,  and  economically—the period from  the  late

1940s through the  late  1950s exhibited the  characteristics of  an  elite
stabilizing and consolidating its organized dominance.

The Ideology of Managerial Consolidation
Managerial  ideology in  the  period of  consolidation was  diffused
throughout the  mass  organizations of  culture and  communication, and
disseminated throughout the  mass  population, by  the intelligentsia that
staffed these organizations, and the ideology itself underwent an adaptation
that was appropriate to the dominant position of the elite it rationalized. The
progressivist liberalism of  the  early  20th  century was  an  ideology of
challenge and conflict that questioned and rejected the dominant institutions
and values of the bourgeois order and articulated a view of man and the
world profoundly different from that of bourgeois and traditional systems of
thought. Progressivist liberalism incorporated into  a  coherent body  the
optimistic and environmentalist premises of the hedonistic, cosmopolitan,
meliorist, and scientistic ideas and values that constituted the public ethic of
managerial society, and it also rationalized, in a form generally consistent
with these ideas, the emergence of mass organizations, their operation and
direction by  managerial elites, and  their  anti-bourgeois  organizational
imperatives. The  ideology of  progressivist liberalism was  radical and
destabilizing in its implications, however. Regardless of the utility of such
implications in  the  period when emergent  managerial forces were
challenging the dominance of the bourgeois elite, they were not useful once
the  managerial elite  had  largely  displaced the  bourgeoisie  as  the
predominant group in national political, economic, and cultural life.
The adaptation that managerial liberalism underwent in the period of
managerial consolidation therefore in  several respects retreated  from,
muted, suspended, qualified, or  moderated the  radical and  destabilizing

premises of earlier liberal ideology. The result was what came to called
“consensus liberalism,” a system of ideas in political theory, economics,
sociology, and historiography that performed the function of rationalizing
the regime of mass organizations and their managerial elites but did so
without emphasizing (and sometimes by actually questioning or rejecting)
the intellectual premises, ideas, and values of progressivist liberalism. The
explicit and overt retention of progressivist elements in the ideology of the
dominant managerial elite would not have served the interests of the elite in
a period when its principal need was to consolidate rather than to continue
to expand its social dominance. The discovery or invention of other, less
destabilizing premises to  justify the  regime was  a  necessary part  of  its
consolidation.
The  principal architects of  consensus liberalism—Arthur Schlesinger,
Jr.  and Reinhold Niebuhr in political thought; John Kenneth Galbraith in
economics; Louis Hartz, Richard Hofstadter,  and  Daniel Bell  in
historiography and sociology, among many others—exhibited a number of
common themes in their writings: a skeptical attitude toward the optimistic
and environmentalist view of man and its melioristic and social engineering
implications that had characterized managerial liberalism in its emergent,
progressivist phase; a  commitment, despite this  skepticism, to  the
institutions and  policies created by  the  managerial revolution and  its
political expression in the New Deal and Fair Deal; an effort to justify such
institutions (large corporations and unions, the centralized activist state, and
the mass organizations of culture and communication) not as hostile to the
bourgeois order (as in progressivism) but as its continuation and fulfillment;
a  belief  that  the  structures of  the  managerial regime established and
sustained a “pluralistic” political and economic order in which participant
social and political groups shared a national or public “consensus” and the

belief that this order was the culmination of the American tradition; and a
preference for  “pragmatism” and  a  rejection of  “ideology.”  Consensus
liberalism thus  did  not  emphasize the  relativism, optimism, and
environmentalism, and  their  meliorist, hedonistic, cosmopolitan, and
scientistic implications and  correlates, that  constituted progressivist
liberalism. In some cases, consensus liberals explicitly criticized or rejected
such  progressivist  elements, though often  they  retained these  ideas  in  a
hidden or latent form. Niebuhr, indeed, went further than most consensus
liberals in  endorsing the  idea  of  Original Sin  against that  of  human
perfectibility and  in  modifying the scientism and  technocratic social
engineering of  progressivist ideology.  “This  technocratic approach to
problems of history,” he wrote,
which erroneously equates the mastery of nature with the mastery of historical destiny, in
turn accentuates a very old failing in human nature: the inclination of the wise, or the
powerful, or  the  virtuous, to  obscure and  deny  the  human limitations in  all  human
achievements and pretensions.
## [399]
Schlesinger and  other  liberal writers of  the  period also  referred
sympathetically to Original Sin and saw confirmation of similar pessimistic
views of man in Freudian psychology and existentialist philosophy.
This pessimism, anti-utopianism, and skepticism toward the application
of  science to  human  social arrangements led  consensus liberals  to  an
alternative justification of  the  managerial regime. Unlike progressivist
liberals, who generally favored concentrated power as an instrument for
social amelioration, consensus liberals expressed skepticism toward
concentrated and  unbalanced power.  The  mass  structures of  the  regime
would not lead to human and social perfection but were the result of the
pragmatic recognition of  the  need  to  balance large  concentrations of
political, social, and economic power that had developed in the course of

the 20th century. As Niebuhr wrote,
The justice which we have established in our society has been achieved, not by pure
individualism, but by collective action. We have balanced collective social power with
collective social power. In order to prevail against our communist foe we must continue to
engage in  vast  collective ventures, subject ourselves to  far-reaching national and
international disciplines and we must moderate the extravagance of our theory by the
soberness of our practice.
## [400]
The muting of progressivist premises, then, did not in the consensus
liberal ideology suggest the  repudiation of  mass  organization  or  the
restoration of bourgeois individualism or even a suspicion that the New
Deal  and  managerial changes may  have  created new  unbalanced
concentrations of power. On the contrary, consensus liberalism accepted the
irreversibility of the revolution of mass and scale and its organizational
imperatives. To John Kenneth Galbraith the managerial revolution and the
rise of oligopolistic concentrations of economic power in the corporations
necessitated the development of “countervailing powers” in the form of
other  mass  organizations—mass unions, “large  and  powerful retail
enterprises,” and producers’ goods markets such as the “large firms in the
automobile industry.”
## [401]
The  oligopoly of  managerial  capitalism made
obsolete the pluralistic model of competition by many small firms in the
bourgeois economy, and in order to preserve the restraints on and balancing
of  private economic power that  bourgeois  competition permitted, the
countervailing power of mass economic structures was required. When such
countervailing structures did not develop, it was the business of the mass
state to create them. “We can now see,” wrote Galbraith,
that  a  large  part  of  the  state’s  new  activity—the farm  legislation, labor  legislation,
minimum-wage legislation—is associated with the development of countervailing power.
As  such  it  is  neither adventitious nor  abnormal; the  government action supports or
supplements a normal economic process. Steps to strengthen countervailing power are not,
in principle, different from steps to strengthen competition.
## [402]
In the view of consensus liberalism, then, the revolution of mass and

scale and the rise of mass organizations in the economic and political orders
were not threats to the pluralism and limitation of power that characterized
the bourgeois order and its classical liberalism but were a continuation and
a  fulfillment, with  adaptations to  historical circumstances, of  bourgeois
liberal values and  beliefs. To  Niebuhr,  the  Jeffersonian liberalism that
rejected the power of the state was now outmoded and had become the
political formula of  “the  privileged classes” of  the  bourgeois  order.  “A
realistic appreciation of  the  factor of  power in  social life,”  however,
accomplished the purpose of classical liberalism in preserving freedom and
social justice.
[W]e have managed to achieve a tolerable justice in the collective relations of industry by
balancing power against power and equilibrating the various competing social forces of
society. The rise of the labor movement has been particularly important in achieving this
result; for its organization of the power of the workers was necessary to produce the
counter-weight to the great concentrations of economic power which justice requires. . . .
The American democracy, as every other healthy democracy, had learned to use the more
equal distribution of political power, inherent in universal suffrage, as leverage against the
tendency toward concentration of power in economic life. Culminating in the “New Deal,”
national governments, based upon an alliance of farmers, workers and middle classes, have
used the power of the state to establish minimal standards of “welfare” in housing, social
security, health services, etc.
## [403]
The same perception of the managerial regime as a pluralistic and self-
balancing economic, political, and  social  order  underlies Daniel Bell’s
criticism of  C.   Wright Mills  and  James Burnham. “Except in  a  vague,
ideological sense, there  are  relatively few  political issues  on  which the
managerial elite is united,”
## [404]
wrote Bell, who argued that the divergent
interests of managers in state and corporation contributed to the pluralistic
balancing of  power.  Sociologist Arnold Rose  developed a  pluralistic
depiction of  American society,  which he  termed the  “multiinfluence
hypothesis,” as an alternative to the “economic-elite dominance” theory of
Mills, Floyd Hunter, and their school.
## [405]

The “pluralism” described by consensus liberals in American society,
government, and economy found theoretical precedents in the observations
of de Tocqueville on “intermediary institutions” as restraints on power and
in the “checks and balances” of James Madison. American society in Bell’s
view was not a “mass society” “composed of lonely, isolated individuals”
but rather exhibited a broad range of voluntary associations and pressure
groups, ethnic group  organizations, and  diversified cultural associations.
Such  institutions not  only  diversified society and  prevented its  cultural
homogenization but  also  in  their  competition for  political influence
maintained a pluralistic balance of power in society. The competition was
restrained by procedures that governed its conduct and by limited goals that
constituted the  rewards of  competition. The  “historic contribution of
liberalism,” wrote Bell, “was to separate law from morality.” Following the
Reformation and its religious wars, in his view,
No group, be it Catholic or Protestant, could use the state to impose its moral conceptions
on  all  the  people. .  .  . These  theoretical formulations of  modern liberal society were
completed by Kant, who, separating legality and morality, defined the former as the “rules
of the game,” so to speak; law dealt with procedural, not substantive, issues. The latter
were primary matters of conscience, with which the State could not interfere.
## [406]
Bell’s conception of pluralism was closely related to his understanding
of the prevailing “consensus” in American society:
It has been one of the glories of the United States that politics has always been a pragmatic
give-and-take rather than a series of wars-to-the-death. . . . Democratic politics means
bargaining between legitimate groups and the search for consensus. . . . For Madison,
factions (or  divergence  of  interests), being  rooted in  liberty,  were  inevitable, and  the
function of the Republic was to protect the causes of faction, i.e., liberty and the “diversity
in the faculties of men,”. . . . For only through representative government can one achieve
consensus—and conciliation.
## [407]
The  “consensus” view  of  American politics was  supported  by  the
historical interpretations of Louis  Hartz, Daniel Boorstin, and  Richard
Hofstadter, among others, who rejected the progressivist historiography of

Turner, Beard, and Parrington, with its emphasis on the relativism of ideas
and  the  conflict of  economic interests, and  expounded a  view  of  the
American past that effectively excluded all ideologies except a tradition of
liberal consensus. In  Hartz’s  view  the  absence of  “feudalism” in  early
America meant an almost exclusive predominance of bourgeois liberalism
in  the  tradition of John  Locke from  colonial times  to  the  20th  century.
Hence, American political history displayed no  class  conflicts, no
doctrinaire ideologies, and no feudal reactionaries, and its culmination lay
in  the New  Deal,  the  “triumph and  transformation of  liberal reform.”
Richard Hofstadter in the 1948 preface to The American Political Tradition
almost explicitly acknowledged the ideological purpose of the consensus
school’s  revision of  history in  providing legitimization for  the  new
managerial regime:
Above and beyond temporary and local conflicts there has been a common ground, a unity
of cultural and political tradition, upon which American civilization has stood. That culture
has been intensely nationalistic and for the most part isolationist; it has been fiercely
individualistic and  capitalistic. In  a  corporate and  consolidated society demanding
international responsibility, cohesion, centralization, and planning, the traditional ground is
shifting under our feet. It is imperative in a time of cultural crisis to gain fresh perspectives
on the past.
## [408]
The  “fresh perspectives on  the  past,”  that  is,  would function as  the
historiographical rationalizations of the emerging managerial regime.
The “pluralism” that liberalism had historically supported was thus not
entirely “open.” It was open only to “legitimate groups,” in Bell’s phrase,
which presumably  meant those  that  accepted the  limitations of  the
procedures and goals of the competitive political process and were prepared
to bargain within and abide by the “consensus” that imposed the limits. A
group that did not accept these limits, that sought “to impose its moral
conceptions on  all  the  people,”  was  an  illegitimate participant in  the
competition. By  the  mid-20th century,  however,  the  historic liberal

consensus had become somewhat more narrow, as Bell expressed it.
Few serious minds believe any longer that one can set down “blueprints” and through
“social engineering” bring about a new utopia of social harmony. At the same time, the
older “counter-beliefs” have lost their intellectual force as well. Few “classic” liberals
insist that the State should play no role in the economy, and few serious conservatives, at
least  in England and  on  the  Continent, believe that  the Welfare  State  is  “the  road  to
serfdom.” In  the  Western  world, therefore, there  is  today  a  rough  consensus among
intellectuals on  political issues: the  acceptance of  a  Welfare  State;  the  desirability  of
decentralized power; a system of mixed economy and of political pluralism. In that sense,
too, the ideological age has ended.
## [409]
The  mid-century consensus, then,  consisted of  acceptance of  the
structures of the managerial regime and their “pluralistic” functioning—the
welfare state,  mixed economy,  and  the  “decentralized power” of  mass
organizations—as described by  the  “pragmatic” and  “non-ideological”
liberalism of the era.
Those groups that were not legitimate participants in the competitive
process were  those  that  did  not  accept the  procedures and  goals  of  the
competition or did not accept the content of the managerial consensus and
the legitimacy and irreversibility of the managerial regime. Such groups
were, in the term habitually used by consensus liberals, “extremists.” The
Communist Party was one such extra-consensual group, as well as other
totalitarian parties,  and  the  “Far  Right” following of  Senators Taft  and
McCarthy was another, because these forces seemed to reject the regime as
well as the rules of the competitive process in toto. Other elements that lay
outside or on the fringe of the consensus were those groups, on the left, that
still adhered to progressivist ideology, professed a commitment to social
engineering and social amelioration, and sought to expand one sector of the
regime (the state) at the expense of the others. On the right, those who
rejected the managerial regime as the “road to serfdom” and who criticized
the regulatory and interventionist functions of the managerial state were

also  on  the  fringe of  the  consensus. In  the  ideology of  “corporate
liberalism” (an  ideological cluster largely  identical to  “consensus
liberalism), writes historian Ellis  Hawley,  “Radicalism and  authoritarian
conservativism stood outside the contest, useful chiefly as demonologies to
be associated with one’s opponents.”
## [410]
While the physical suppression of
the  “extremists” such  demonologies described was  neither desirable nor
possible without fundamental alterations in the structure of the state, in the
1950s and  1960s “extremism”  was  the  subject of  much  analysis and
discussion (often in clinical terms that questioned the mental balance of the
adherents of  eccentric or  dissident viewpoints), which tended further to
delegitimize “extremist” criticisms of the regime and to exclude those who
expressed such criticisms from political and cultural participation. Seldom
did  the  exponents of  consensus liberalism seek  to  refute or  reply
substantively to the criticisms voiced by “extremists.” “The way to fully
refute a man,” wrote Louis Hartz, “is to ignore him for the most part, and
the only way you can do this is to substitute new fundamental categories for
his  own,  so  that  you  are  simply pursuing a  different path.”
## [411]
## The
managerial regime, in the course of its period of consolidation, sought to
use consensus liberalism to “substitute new fundamental categories” and to
establish a “different path” along which only its elite and its adherents and
supporters could travel. Those who could not adapt themselves to the new
categories and travel the managerial path—by virtue of their interests as
social groups, their ideological commitments, or their cultural formation—
were effectively excluded from the “pluralism” and the “open society” of
the managerial consensus, which was never as stable or as broad as its
champions wanted to believe.
The  relatively closed consensus  that  the  liberalism of  the  1950s
endorsed also connected with the elitist content of liberal ideology in this

period. While progressivist liberalism had defended the political role of the
masses in conflict with bourgeois elites, consensus liberalism retreated from
this  democratist position and  exhibited a  hostility toward mass  political
movements. In part, the change in liberal attitudes toward the “common
man”  was  the  result  of  the  fear  of  the  mass  movements that  had  been
mobilized by National Socialist and Fascist regimes in Europe and of fears
of similar movements led by Joseph McCarthy and the “Far Right” in the
United States. But progressivist liberalism also, despite its support for the
extension of mass democracy, had contained the elements of elitism in its
faith in the capacity of specially trained social engineers to reform and
ameliorate society.  Whatever the  immediate source of  the  elitism of
consensus liberalism, it was an idea that had precedents in progressivist
thought and indeed in the liberalism of the Enlightenment. Moreover, it was
highly compatible with the interests of the managerial elite as well as with
the “pluralism” and “consensus” on which liberalism of the 1950s centered.
“The emphasis” of contemporary liberal thought, wrote Peter Bachrach, a
critic of consensus liberalism, in 1967,
is  no  longer upon  extending or  strengthening democracy,  but  upon  stabilizing  the
established system. The focus, in short, is upon protecting liberalism from the excesses of
democracy rather than upon utilizing liberal means to progress toward the realization of
democratic ideals. Political equilibrium is the fundamental value of the new theory. Thus
the political passivity of the great majority of the people is not regarded as an element of
democratic malfunctioning, but on the contrary, as a necessary condition for allowing the
creative functioning of the elite.
## [412]
In  consensus liberal thought, mass  participation in  politics itself
bordered on  being an  illegitimate intrusion of  often  irrelevant or
destabilizing forces that distracted the elite from its implementation of the
managerial agenda  and  created the  risk  of  destroying the  consensus,
challenging the structures of the managerial regime, and endangering the
fulfillment of the agenda.

The  retreat of  consensus liberalism from  progressivist and  anti-
bourgeois  ideas  and  values did  not,  then,  weaken its  attachment to  and
defense of the managerial regime of mass organizations and their elites.
Since the new elite was already dominant (though not perhaps as securely
as  it  wanted to  believe), it  was  unnecessary to  continue to  challenge
bourgeois ideology, except where it persisted in movements or interests that
resisted assimilation into the new regime. The process of assimilation was
assisted by the depiction of the regime as an adaptation of the bourgeois and
classical liberal values of “balance” and “pluralism.” Bourgeois forces that
would have resisted or rejected the regime and its anti-bourgeois impetus
could more easily accept it if they could be convinced that its structures and
functioning were  consistent with  their  own  basic  ideas  and  values.
Managerial elements,  too,  if  they  were  not  comfortable with  the  anti-
bourgeois  implications of  progressivist thought and  the  direction of  the
managerial forces they controlled and if they retained an attachment to the
bourgeois order, could more easily accept the dynamic of mass organization
if they could believe their actions were compatible with and a continuation
of bourgeois interests and ideology.
The  process by  which a  new  elite  imitates or  usurps the  ideology,
institutions, values, and styles of an old elite that it has replaced is not
unknown in history and is analogous to the phenomenon noted by Oswald
Spengler under the name of “pseudomorphosis” in cultural history. Just as a
new  culture may  imitate the  forms of  an  older  civilization  that  it  is
displacing, so new elites may imitate the forms of older elites that they are
supplanting.
By the term “historical pseudomorphosis” I propose to designate those cases in which an
older alien Culture lies so massively over the land that a young Culture, born in this land,
cannot get its breath and fails not only to achieve pure and specific expression-forms, but
even to develop fully its own self-consciousness. All that wells up from the depths of the

young soul is cast in the old molds, young feelings stiffen in senile works, and instead of
rearing itself up in its own creative power, it can only hate the distant power with a hate
that grows to be monstrous.
## [413]
In the late 19th century, the bourgeois elite, as it consolidated its power,
adopted a  pseudomorphosis of  the  aristocratic elites  of  the  prescriptive
regimes it  had  earlier challenged  and  displaced, and  a  similar  process
appeared in  the  Augustan political  revolution in  ancient Rome. Thus,
Augustus Caesar, having established his own autocratic power in Rome on
the basis of a new elite, made use of the republican forms of the old regime
and even of its deceased apologist, Marcus Porcius Cato, to rationalize his
monarchy.  “Despotism,” wrote historian Ronald Syme, “enthroned at
Rome, was arrayed in robes torn from the corpse of the Republic.”
## [414]
## Thus
did the consensus liberalism of the 1950s array the new managerial regime
in the ideological and rhetorical robes of the moribund bourgeois order.
Yet consensus liberalism did not, for the most part, formally reject or
seek  to  refute the  scientistic, meliorist, hedonistic, and  cosmopolitan
premises of progressivist ideology, and the major exponents of consensus
liberalism sometimes expressed similar ideas  even  while  denying them.
Thus,  Arthur Schlesinger,  Jr.  expressed his  certainty “that  history has
equipped modern American liberalism with the ideas and the knowledge to
construct a  society where men  will  be  both  free  and  happy,”
## [415]
an
affirmation that  was  essentially indistinguishable from  the  meliorist and
utopian ideas he sought to moderate. Similarly, Niebuhr, while criticizing
the idea of a “world state” as impractical, nevertheless endorsed a form of
cosmopolitanism as essential to modern American global responsibilities.
“Modern technical  achievements,” he  wrote, have  “accentuated the
interdependence of men and nations,” and
The strategy of bringing power under social and political review is a possibility for the
international community, even in its present nascent form. It is a wholesome development

for America and the world that the United Nations is becoming firmly established, not so
much  as  an  institution .  .  .  but  as  an  organ  in  which even  the  most  powerful of  the
democratic nations must bring their policies under the scrutiny of world public opinion.
## [416]
Daniel Bell also harbored presuppositions closely related to meliorist
and cosmopolitan ideas. He criticized aristocratic and romantic theories of
mass  society on  the  grounds that  “they  reflect a  narrow conception of
human potentialities,” and he noted, in contemptuous tones, “Among the
middle-sized business concerns—more of which are predominantly family
enterprises,” the resistance to governmental intervention in the economy
and the resentment of social change:
The very amorphousness of society, the rise of new and threatening interest groups, the
emergence of social movements and of ideologies, heighten the anxieties of people who,
within their small ponds, once had power and now find themselves in the currents of swift-
moving streams. It is among this group that one finds the fierce Taft partisans, the crabbed
“small-town” mind.
## [417]
Galbraith praised the “opulence” of the American economy as the basis
for the social reforms of the managerial state. “The costs of free education,
social security, assistance to farmers and like measures of domestic welfare
have  been  deeply disguised by  the  general increase in  income,”
## [418]
and
“opulence” thus  provided a  basis  for  the  hedonistic ethic  of  mass
consumption and the satisfaction of material wants by the social programs
of the managerial state, as did Keynesian economic theory in general. “The
root evil” to Keynes, wrote Bell, “was the bourgeois ‘virtue’ of thrift (‘the
penny wisdom of Gladstonian finance’),”
and the necessary intellectual task of the generation was to exorcise that ghost. Keynes’s
great work on The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money was not only an
economic tract but equally a savage sociological polemic against the “puritanism . . .
which has neglected the arts of production as well as those of enjoyment.”
## [419]
Keynesian theory,  with  its  reliance on  mathematical analysis of  the
economy and  its  commitment  to  centralized economic planning,

presupposed much of the scientism of progressivist ideology, and indeed
consensus liberalism itself was largely the construct of social scientists,
who tended to regard their own beliefs as scientific while sociologizing and
psychologizing contrary ideas expressed by bourgeois dissidents. While a
“Christian realist” like Niebuhr was more skeptical of scientism and the
“technocratic mentality,”  the  social scientists among the  exponents of
consensus liberalism generally presupposed a tacit faith in the application
of science to social arrangements for the goal of gradual and managerially
directed social change.
Consensus liberalism generally performed two major functions for the
managerial regime in the period of its consolidation. First, it legitimized the
regime in terms acceptable to bourgeois elements by presenting the regime
and its functioning as a continuation and fulfillment, with adaptations, of
bourgeois liberalism. It thus served to minimize social conflict between the
dominant managerial elites  and  the  remnants of  the bourgeois  order,  to
disguise the conflicts between them that actually persisted, and to assimilate
elements with bourgeois attachments into the “consensus” on which the
regime operated.
Second, consensus liberalism sought to limit or stabilize the expansion
of the mass organizations of the regime and to communicate the need for
stabilization to the elite itself in all sectors. The growth of the scale, power,
territory,  population, and  economic and  technological resources at  the
command of the managerial regime in the era of its emergence between
1930  and  1945  was  such  that  it  could  not  at  the  end  of World War  II
continue its growth at the same pace without jeopardizing its gains. It had
first  to  consolidate its  new  power and  resources under  the  control of  a
stabilized apparatus of power, to legitimize and integrate it with the beliefs

and  aspirations of  the  mass  population, and  to  make  certain  that  its
apparatus could survive. Through its professed skepticism of concentrations
of  power,  its  qualified faith  in  the  “technocratic mentality” and social
engineering, its muting of progressivist themes and values, and its defense
of “pluralism” and “balance,” consensus liberalism sought to moderate the
expansionist tendencies of  the  regime and  to  stabilize and  channel its
energies  within the  existing framework of  mass  organizations. Largely
ignoring the  emerging  fusion of  the  economic, political, and  cultural
structures, the  formal theory of  consensus liberalism emphasized the
supposed “countervailing” and  “balancing” tendencies of  mass
organizations. Consensus liberalism thus  developed an  alternative
rationalization for the dominance of the managerial elite different from that
developed by progressivist liberalism; but it did not abandon or entirely
reject progressivist values and often reflected them even while muting or
doubting them,  and  progressivist ideas  could be  resuscitated at  the
appropriate time to legitimize the re-acceleration of the regime.
The ideology of consensus liberalism also instructed the various sectors
of the regime that their interests were secure only in their relationships with
the other sectors and could be effectively pursued only if the interests of the
other sectors could also be satisfied and if the mass organizations of one
sector did  not  dominate and  exclude the  others. It  was  the  common
recognition of this mutual interdependence that constituted the core of the
“consensus” to  which liberalism appealed. The  “pluralistic consensus”
served to exclude from the dominant culture and the political process those
groups that  did  not  defer  to  and  accept managerial interests. The
“consensus” was thus limited largely to the mass organizations and their
elites and to those groups that were attached to or accepted their permanent
dominance and imperatives. Those groups and social forces that did not

accept or defer to managerial interests and their ideology were excluded,
ignored, or  analyzed in  terms that  effectively delegitimized their
participation in  the  “open society” and  discouraged their  aspirations to
significant power.
Consensus liberalism, then, served the interests of the managerial elite in
its period of consolidation, just as progressivist liberalism had served its
interests in the course of its period of emergence in the early part of the
century and  in  the  Depression and  Second World  War.  American
progressives in  the  post-War  era  who  expressed disappointment or
bitterness at the retreat of liberalism from the continuation of the aggressive
pace of its reforms failed to understand the political and social functions
that  liberalism performed as  an  ideology of  the  managerial elite.  Their
failure is  hardly surprising, since  the  progressivist understanding of  the
social functions of ideas was largely applied only to the ideologies of their
opponents, and  they  normally  failed  to  apply  their  skepticism toward
bourgeois ideologies and formulas to their own liberal ideas. The social and
political meaning of liberalism and its rise in the 20th century was not the
promotion of  social  justice, reform, or  the  other  values that  it  overtly
professed, however,  but  rather  the  rationalization of  the  emergence  and
consolidation of social, economic, and political power by the new social
force of the managerial elite that found the ideology of liberalism useful to
its own aspirations and interests. It is doubtful that liberalism of any kind,
progressivist or consensus, would have enjoyed much success had its ideas
and proposals not been congruent with the interests of an ascendant and
eventually dominant social force. In this respect, liberalism was as much of
a mask for interests as were the bourgeois ideologies and moral codes that it
criticized and rejected.

Economic, Cultural, and Political
## Consolidation
Just as changes in managerial ideology in the post-War era reflected
changes in  the  interests of  the  managerial elite,  so  corresponding
developments in the mass state, economy, and culture of managerial society
generated a style of behavior that was characteristic of an elite in a period
of consolidation. The managerial elite consolidated its power and position
by perpetuating the national and even international dominance of the mass
organizations it  controlled, and  the  process of  consolidation involved
retaining the  organizational and  policy framework of  the New  Deal,
adapting it to the more normal economic and international circumstances of
the late 1940s and 1950s, and developing ideological rationalizations for it
through the consensus liberalism that prevailed in this era.
In the economy, legislation and policies that encouraged and sustained
oligopoly, concentration, and massive scale and contributed further to the
fusion of state and economy perpetuated the mass corporations and unions
as the dominant organizational forms. Although the managerial elites of
corporations and  unions retained mutual antagonisms and  distrust and
though they  disagreed strongly  over  the  content of  economic policy,  a
consensus between  them  evolved in  the  period of  consolidation that
balanced their interests and tended to reconcile them to acceptance of a
framework of legislation and policies that reflected the basic interests of
each group. In the culture, increasing subsidization by government and the
development of  mass  media in  corporate and  bureaucratic forms
perpetuated the  dominance of  the  mass  organizations of  culture and

communication and  enabled them  to  resist  challenges from  smaller
organizations that were not under managerial control. In the state itself, the
bureaucratic elite  of  the  executive branch consolidated its  power by
routinizing the  charismatic authority of  managerial Caesarism into  a
permanent bureaucratic structure that  operated according to  managerial
interests and  imperatives and  became the  central organ  of  the  fused
economic-political-cultural apparatus that  constituted the  managerial
regime. In the period of consolidation, then, the state served as the principal
structure by which the dominance of the mass organizations of the regime
was perpetuated.
The  economy that  emerged  from  the  end  of  the  Depression and  the
Second World  War  exhibited  increasingly oligopolistic trends, was
dominated by  mass  corporations and  labor  unions, and  operated quite
differently from,  and  was  adverse to  the  interests and  values  of,  the
entrepreneurial capitalism of  the  bourgeois  order.  “In  industry after
industry,” writes Robert Heilbroner, “economies of large-scale production
have brought about a situation in which a few large producers divide the
market among themselves.”
## [420]
In the absence of a multitude of competing
small firms, the competitive economy of the bourgeois order, the relevance
of the bourgeois ethic (the values of which were centered on competition),
and the power of consumers to determine allocation of resources and the
prices of goods and services all cease to pertain. In oligopolistic markets,
the preeminent large firms determine prices, and smaller firms within the
industry follow their lead. Although competition continues to exist among
large firms, it does not resemble entrepreneurial competition, in which the
bourgeois virtues of frugality, foresight, prudence, utility, and deferral of
gratification reinforced economic incentives to  lower the  costs  of
production for the purpose of underselling competing firms. The incentives

as well as the mentality of modern corporate managers thus differ from
those of bourgeois entrepreneurs. In Heilbroner’s description,
[T]he  new  management now  adopted a  new  strategy for  corporate growth—or rather,
abandoned an  old  one. Advances in  technology,  changes in  product design, vigorous
advertising, the wooing of businesses to be acquired in other fields—all these provided
ample outlets for the managerial impulse toward expansion. But one mode of growth—the
mode that the founders of the great enterprises had never hesitated to use—was now ruled
out:   Growth was no longer to be sought by the direct, head-on competition of one firm
against another in terms of price.
## [421]
In  the  absence of  consumer control of  allocation of  the  factors of
production and of prices, “the great corporations today do not merely ‘fill’
the wants of consumers. They themselves help to create these wants by
massive efforts  to  interest the  public in  buying the  products  they
manufacture.”
## [422]
The need of oligopolistic economies to create wants, to
stimulate demand, is  the  economic basis  of  the  hedonistic ethic  that
animates the system of mass production and consumption and the origin of
the imperative of managerial capitalism to erode the more restrictive and
ascetic values of the bourgeois moral and cultural order. It also is the source
of the imperative of managerial economic structures to fuse with the mass
state in formulating policies that will sustain the level of aggregate demand
through the manipulation of fiscal and monetary policy and provision of an
“income floor” for the stimulation of mass consumption and, at the same
time,  to  fuse  with  and  rely  on  mass  media for  the  dissemination of
propaganda for their mass products in the form of advertising and public
relations.
Mass labor unions, themselves integrated with the state through New
Deal labor legislation, play an important role under oligopolistic conditions,
partly by increasing the purchasing power of their members but also by
helping to eliminate the competition of smaller firms and by encouraging
concentration. As Daniel Bell wrote in the 1950s,

In oligopolistic markets, i.e., in industries dominated by a few giant firms, the unions
eliminate wages as a competitive factor by “pattern bargaining,” that is, by imposing wage
agreements on all firms in the industry. While, theoretically, bargaining is still done with
individual firms, in practice (as is seen in the case of steel) the agreement is industry-wide.
In the highly competitive or unit-size fields, the unions have stepped in and provided a
monopoly structure to the market, limiting the entry of firms into the industry, establishing
price  lines,  etc. This  has  been  true  most  notably in  the  coal  industry,  in  the  garment
industry, and in the construction trades.
## [423]
Mass corporations and unions and their leadership thus share common
interests in perpetuating their organizational and operational scale and in
carrying out  the  imperatives of  massive scale  in  the  encouragement of
concentration, the integration of state and economy, the oligopolistic control
of  prices  and  markets, the  stimulation of  mass  demand, and  the
abandonment of  bourgeois  ideology  and  moral codes  that  restrict and
constrain these imperatives. Moreover, the leadership that emerged in mass
labor unions in the post-War period itself resembled the managerial elite in
the corporations.
The shift in favor of what the public thought of as the economic and political power of
“labor” meant in actuality a shift in favor of the power of the management of labor unions.
There had already developed the same kind of potential divergence of interest between the
managements of  labor  unions and  the  rank  and  file  as  had  developed between  the
management of corporations and the stockholders. . . . Once entrenched, the management
of  a  national  labor  union  customarily perpetuated itself;  members of  the  managerial
hierarchy almost never became ordinary workers again. Thus, labor unions were acted
upon by the same forces that tend to perpetuate the power of managerial groups in almost
all organizations, including cooperatives and farm organizations.
## [424]
The common interests shared by the managerial elites of mass unions
and corporations served to unite them against the dissimilar interests of
smaller entrepreneurial firms.
Although the elites of unions and corporations were comparatively slow
to  perceive  their  common interests, and  although each  in  the  post-War
period often demanded more power than the other could afford to grant, the
decade following the end of World War II witnessed the development of a

consensus between the leadership of labor and corporations that partially
satisfied the interests of each. The regularization of power relations between
corporate and labor elites and the basis of the consensus between them was
established by legislative and policy developments that consolidated the
innovations of the New Deal and further integrated the mass organizations
of the economy with the mass state.
New Deal interventionist and regulatory policies were adopted largely as
emergency responses to the Depression, and the return of prosperity at the
end of World War II led to a questioning of the need for such policies on the
part of some political and business forces, as well as a demand for their
continuation and extension by organized labor and its allies. The Truman
administration clearly sympathized with labor, though it found itself obliged
for  national  security and  political reasons to  resist  the  more  extreme
demands of the unions. The Eisenhower administration clearly supported
“business,” though it too found compromises with labor unavoidable. The
conventional dichotomies between “labor” and  “management,” “public”
and  private,” and  “government” and  “business,” however,  are  less
meaningful than  the  dichotomy between managerial and  mass-scale
organizations, on  the  one  hand, and  bourgeois and  small-scale
organizations, on  the  other.  In  this  perspective both  the  Truman and
Eisenhower administrations may be seen as the political expressions of the
new managerial elite that straddled and transcended the mass corporations,
the  mass  unions, and  the  mass  state;  and  their  policies—questioned,
criticized, and  resisted by  bourgeois  economic and  political forces—
reflected the interests and imperatives of the managers and worked to the
disadvantage of the declining bourgeois elite and its order.
The consensus within the managerial elite on economic policies that

evolved in the period of consolidation retained the general framework of the
New Deal and adapted and regularized it for the more normal economic and
peacetime conditions of the post-War era. The consensus rejected the more
extreme demands of  organized  labor  as  well  as  entrepreneurial and
bourgeois demands for  a  complete elimination of  New Deal
interventionism, and  the  consensus involved the  acceptance of  the
permanent economic and political role of labor by managerial corporations,
the acceptance of a permanent and increasing role of the state in economic
affairs,  and  the  acceptance of  managerial capitalism by  labor  and  its
political and ideological allies. Thus, in the Truman administration, groups
such as the Committee for Economic Development (CED) and the Business
Council, composed largely  of  representatives of  the  managerial
corporations and  their  ideological  and  political supporters, were  able  to
modify the original version of the Employment Act of 1946 and remove its
commitment of the federal government to the guarantee of full employment,
a demand of the unions. Nevertheless, the Act as finally passed committed
the government to a continuing role in promoting employment, production,
and  purchasing power and  created the  Council of  Economic Advisers
(CEA) as  a  permanent institution by  which the  presidency could  exert
power in the economy. The Employment Act, “one of the truly historic
pieces of  American economic  legislation,”
## [425]
thus  institutionalized the
basis for the fusion of state and economy that the New Deal had formally
inaugurated on a large scale, and it provided the foundations for further
integration of  state  and  economy  in  the  future. The  whole concept was
vigorously opposed by the entrepreneurial firms that largely composed the
National Association  of  Manufacturers (NAM), and  the  passage of  the
Employment Act  represents a  rejection of  the  bourgeois  concept of  the
limited, neutralist state  and  an  acceptance on  a  permanent basis  of  the

managerial concept of the activist, interventionist, and expansionist state.
Passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1948 represented a partial victory for
entrepreneurial and bourgeois forces against the power of organized labor,
although the Act also received the support of corporate managerial forces as
an  effort  to  restrict but  not  to  reject  labor  as  a  part  of  the  managerial
consensus. Entrepreneurial forces originally regarded the Act  as  a  step
toward the dismantling of the power that labor had acquired in the New
Deal legislation of the 1930s.
Once  it  became clear  that  liberal  forces were  unable to  marshal
sufficient congressional support to  repeal Taft-Hartley—even after
unexpected Democratic victories in  the  1948  elections—the alliance of
convenience regarding labor  relations policy between the  relatively
conservative NAM  and  Chamber of  Commerce and  the  comparatively
moderate Business Council and CED swiftly broke down. From this time
forth, big-business-backed organizations like the latter made no effort to
expand the  scope  of  their  victories. Having used  Congress to  deny  the
postwar industrial initiative to the AFL and the CIO , larger corporations
and their leaders were generally content to live with a status quo in which
powerful trade unions figured prominently.
## [426]
Anti-trust legislation enacted in 1950 (the Celler-Kefauver Amendment
to  the Clayton Act),  while  restricting  mergers  of  competitors and  the
creation of monopolies, did nothing to reduce existing concentration and in
fact encouraged the expansion of mass corporations, through mergers with
non-competitive firms, into conglomerates. Moreover, the legislation served
to perpetuate oligopoly by protecting existing large firms from absorption
by their competitors. “Between 1951 and 1960,” writes Heilbroner, “one-
fifth  of  the  top  1,000  corporations disappeared—absorbed within the

remaining four-fifths.”
## [427]
This  concentration, however,  occurred in
different and non-competing industries through the conglomerate merging
of corporations in different markets and resulted in the “stabilization of
concentration within industry.” Anti-trust legislation and  its  judicial and
administrative interpretation played a  significant role  in  sustaining and
perpetuating the dominance of the managerial corporations in the economy
and in encouraging their tendencies to conglomeration.
## [428]
Legislation such
as  the  Employment and  Taft-Hartley Acts  and  the  Celler-Kefauver
Amendment served to  establish the  managerial elite  of  the  mass
corporations and unions as the dominant forces in the economic sector of
the  managerial regime, though labor  leaders were  a  lesser,  limited, but
assimilated element of the elite, and each group came to accept the interests
of the other as a legitimate part of the managerial consensus on economic
policy.
The Eisenhower administration eagerly  accepted and  continued the
consolidation of  mass  organizations and  their  elites  in  the  economy.  In
President Eisenhower’s mind,
The federal government was there, was very big, and was going to remain big. Instead of
trying to dismantle the government, it was the task of intelligent conservatives to enable
the government to do its job in cooperation with private interest groups, utilizing as much
private, as opposed to bureaucratic, advice as possible. Thereby, a federal government
which had become big in large part as a reaction to the failures of private power would
remain big in conjunction with powerful organized interest groups.
## [429]
For all the rhetoric of the administration about “private” groups and
“free enterprise,” the conjunction of the “private” mass organizations of the
economy and the “public” mass state contributed to the fusion of state and
economy still  further.  The  leading members of  the  Eisenhower cabinet
reflected the  managerial orientation of  the  administration. The  most
influential members on  domestic and  defense policies were George

M.   Humphrey ,  president of  the  M.A.    Hanna Company,  and Charles
E.  Wilson, president of General Motors, both of whom were leaders of the
Business Council and became respectively Secretaries of the Treasury and
Defense. Although Humphrey and  Wilson  both  retained  bourgeois
preconceptions in favor of balanced budgets and small, limited government,
they “were decidedly not businessmen of the 1920s type. They were part of
the new, more adaptable managerial class,” and both had taken the lead
among top  corporate managers in  making important concessions to
organized labor in 1947 and 1948.
## [430]
Wilson’s well-known and much caricatured remark during his Senate
confirmation hearings—“What is good for the United States is good for the
General Motors Corporation and vice versa”—reflected the orientation of
the Eisenhower administration toward the interests of mass corporations, as
did the advice to farmers allegedly offered by Secretary of Agriculture Ezra
Taft Benson: “Get big or get out.” The provisions of the Smith-Lever Act in
1955 encouraged the consolidation of large agricultural business concerns,
and, in sociologist Allan Carlson’s words, “Federal policy was reshaped,
often  in  subtle ways, to  encourage  the  consolidation of  the  ‘surplus’
agrarian population into other jobs.”
## [431]
So far from reducing the role of
government in economy and society, in the course of the Eisenhower era,
## Eisenhower
signed a  major public housing law,  the  first  civil  rights  laws  since  Reconstruction,
sponsored a program of federal aid to education, inaugurated an expensive new public
works program in highways, and increased social security benefits three times. At the end
of  the  decade Americans  had  a  national government very  much  like  the  one Truman
headed while Eisenhower was  still  president of  Columbia, a  large  and  complex
government with  a  wide  array  of  social  responsibilities. It  intervened everywhere, to
promote welfare, prepare for welfare, regulate and subsidize enterprise, promote science
and education.
## [432]
While the  public rhetoric of  the  Eisenhower administration often

reflected the  bourgeois  and  entrepreneurial values and  ideology that
persisted among most Republicans and many Americans, its actual policies
promoted the  consolidation of  the  mass  structures of  the  managerial
economy,  continued  the  interventionist and  activist role  of  the  federal
government, institutionalized the  apparatus of  managerial control of
economy and society, and helped to crystallize a consensus that reconciled
the managerial elites of unions, corporations, and government to the mutual
acceptance and common recognition of their shared interests. “In a very real
sense,” wrote Eric Goldman, “the Truman and the early Eisenhower years
blended into one development.”
It was the Truman Administration that began codifying New Dealism in domestic affairs—
slowing down its pace, pushing its attitude only in areas of outstanding need. . . . The
Eisenhower Administration, whatever its  modifications, continued the  codification in
domestic affairs and extended the breakaways in the foreign field.
## [433]
The “codification of the New Deal” by the Truman and Eisenhower
administrations in domestic and especially economic policies represented
the consolidation of the power of the managerial elite in the mass economy
it had come to dominate. Legislative enactments of this period perpetuated
the  power of  mass  unions and  corporations and  the  mass  state  in  the
economy, and the acceptance of the economic and social activism of the
state  by  the  managerial elite  of  the  corporations perpetuated  the  close
relationship between the corporate elite and the fused political-economic
apparatus.
The consolidation of the dominance of the mass cultural organizations in
the post-War period is suggested by the dramatic increases in federal aid to
education in these years. Although the Roosevelt administration increased
federal grants-in-aid to  state  and  local  governments for  educational and
research purposes, the total sum provided by the federal government for

these purposes increased from $25 million in 1945 to $49 million in 1951
and rose to $122 million in 1952 and to $363 million by 1960. The student
population enrolled in degree programs in institutions of higher learning
also increased from 1 to 3.5 million between 1944 and 1960. While the
number of colleges and universities increased only slightly in the period
from 1945 to 1960, the number of faculty members within them more than
doubled.
## [434]
The federal support of educational costs for veterans in the
G.I.    Bill  accounted for  a  large  part  of  the  expansion in  the  student
population and thus for the increases in the scale, facilities, employees, and
functions of  educational institutions. Federal support for  research was
oriented largely to scientific and technical efforts, and the establishment of
the National Science Foundation in 1950 encouraged this trend toward the
development of fields essential to managerial skills and functions.
Governmental grants to and contracts with universities for research and
other purposes and governmental aid for the costs of education thus served
to consolidate the dominance of the mass educational organizations and
contributed to the concentration of cultural and intellectual life within their
bureaucratized framework. The  increasing level  of  financial support for
universities by the federal government corresponded also to the needs and
interests of the managerial elite in the state and corporations as well as to
those of the managerial intelligentsia. “It was the Manhattan Project, the V-
12 Program, the GI Bill of Rights,” writes Jacques Barzun, “following close
upon the participation of the academic community in the New Deal, that
catapulted the university into its present headlong rush. To that momentum
was added, after the war, the impetus of a world power that must continue
to mobilize academic men for global advice and activity.”
## [435]
The managerial elite in the mass media also consolidated its dominance

in the post-War period, particularly through the development of the new
medium of television, which quickly assumed the organizational form of
the  managerial corporation. Although the  limited geographical range  of
television signals suggests the possibility of a highly localized industry, the
economies of program production and the regulatory policies of the Federal
Communications Commission, influenced by  the  interests of  the  major
networks, created a national oligopolistic industry that depended upon a
mass audience and promoted the uniformity and homogeneity of the content
of programming. “All of television in its first twenty-five years,” writes Ben
## H. Bagdikian,
was fashioned by the idea of One Big National Audience, with advertising, economics, and
ratings attuned to  audiences in  multiples of  one  million, which in  most  communities
cannot be matched by local programming. . . . The rationale of One Big National Audience
inevitably meant that in order to evoke and maintain the interest of so large a single
audience all national programming (and, because of its dominance in competition, all local
programming) would have to find the lowest common denominator of interest, which is
action, conflict, sex, violence, and entertainment of the most general kind. . . . [B]ecause of
corporate policy and  its  influence on  regulation, it  [television] became a  medium
dominated by standardized national programming.
## [436]
The corporate form of the television industry and the highly technical
nature of  production and  programming contributed to  the  managerial
control of  the  new  medium, but  the  principal regulatory decision that
perpetuated the dominance of mass organizations in the medium was the
ruling  by  the  FCC  in  1948  to  freeze applications for  licensing of  new
television stations and to limit programming to Very High Frequency (VHF)
bands. The freeze was lifted in 1952, but most television sets in private
homes had been designed by that time to receive only VHF transmissions.
By 1964 only 10 per cent of television sets in use were capable of receiving
Ultra High Frequency (UHF), and stations that used UHF for broadcasting
were unable to find viewers. The early restriction to VHF, which is limited
to 13 channels, contributed to the dominance of the television industry by

the oligopoly of three networks. On UHF bands 70 channels are available,
and the control by the major networks of three of the four to six VHF
channels on which broadcasting is technically feasible without interference
effectively prevented the development of a locally based television industry
and promoted the homogenization of the content of the medium.
[I]n the shortage of channels, the earliest corporations developed monopoly and near-
monopoly domination. . . . With a small number of channels, the dominance of national
programming was  inevitable. The  professional  polish and  access to  talent  of  national
organizations could not be matched by individual local stations, and for that reason the
national programs would attract a  larger  audience. Because it  could  attract a  larger
audience, it could sell its advertising time for higher prices, which further increased the
gap in resources between local and national programs.
## [437]
Governmental policy thus served to perpetuate the dominance of the
mass media and cultural organizations, as it did that of the mass economic
organizations.
Politically also, the post-War era was a period of consolidation in which
the formal structures of the mass state were stabilized and perpetuated. As
in ideological and cultural affairs and the economy, the result was not the
immediate continuation of managerial expansion but the consolidation of
what the new elite had acquired. Once a new social force has become a
dominant minority as  an  elite  through the  charismatic authority of  a
Caesarist leader, its members need, in Max Weber’s words, “to have their
social and economic positions ‘legitimized.’”
They wish to see their positions transformed from purely factual power relations into a
cosmos of  acquired rights, and  to  know  that  they  are  thus  sanctified. These  interests
comprise by far the strongest motive for the conservation of charismatic elements of an
objectified nature within the structure of domination.
## [438]
One  means  by  which power originally acquired by  charisma is
“objectified” or institutionalized is bureaucratization. The power that at first
derived from the personal charisma of the Caesarist leader is transformed

into  permanent, rationalized, organized structures of  administration.
Following the death of Franklin Roosevelt, the principal Caesarist leader of
the  managerial elite,  and  the  passing of  the  emergencies of  war  and
depression that had created opportunities for his rise and the ascendancy of
the managerial elite in association with him, the new elite routinized its
power into the permanent structures of the federal bureaucracy and thus
perpetuated its control of the mass state.
Neither Harry Truman nor Dwight Eisenhower displayed the charismatic
qualities of Franklin Roosevelt’s public personality. Although Eisenhower
was an extraordinarily popular president, the public image that he projected
and  cultivated was  that  of  a  decent, trustworthy,  and  avuncular
administrator, rather than that of a dynamic, self-reliant, omnipotent leader.
Truman, while he often appealed to the role of spokesman for the masses
that Roosevelt performed, was more successful in presenting himself as the
honest common man unwillingly called to great responsibilities.
The  lack  of  charismatic qualities in  both  Truman and  Eisenhower
conjoined with  the  end  of  the  war  and  the  depression to  threaten the
abandonment and dismantling of the mass state that had been created in the
course of  the New  Deal.  Such  a  reversal of  the  development of  the
managerial state,  however,  was  directly contrary to  the  interests and
aspirations of  the  managerial elite,  which had  depended on  the  mass
political apparatus and its functions for its own power. Further expansion of
the  state,  however,  through a  continuing assault on  the  bourgeois
institutions that  limited and  constrained government, and  through a
democratist Caesarism that used the executive branch in alliance with the
mass population as the spearhead of the assault on the bourgeois order, was
not in the immediate interest of the managerial elite. In the late 1940s and

1950s the principal interest of the new elite lay in preserving the expanded
apparatus of the state against bourgeois counterattacks, in rationalizing and
regularizing the apparatus and its functions to meet the interests and needs
of each sector of the elite, in legitimizing the functions of the apparatus in
the absence of war and depression, and in perpetuating the apparatus for the
preservation and  transmission of  managerial power.  In  short,  while  the
managerial elite  in  the  period of  consolidation had  no  interest in
dismantling or reducing the expanded scale and functions of the state and
its executive branch, it also had little interest in continuing the expansion of
the  state  at  the  same  pace  as  in  the  period of  its  emergence,  and  it
principally sought to perpetuate, stabilize, and assimilate the political power
it had acquired.
The perpetuation of the expanded size and power of the central state was
achieved through a series of legislative enactments in the post-War period.
The  Employment  Act  of  1946  established the  Council of  Economic
Advisors, which  became under Arthur Burns in  the  first  Eisenhower
administration and  later  under James Tobin  and Walter  Heller under
President Kennedy a  center for  Keynesian economic policy and  an
instrument for governmental manipulation of the economy. “The Council of
Economic Advisors,” writes Louis M.   Kohlmeier, Jr., “has become a super
economic planning bureau and the President has become the economic as
well as the political chief of state.”
## [439]
The independent regulatory agencies
created by  Roosevelt were  retained in  the  post-War  era,  and  the
Administrative Procedures Act of 1946 sought to rationalize their functions.
The Act  “tended to  isolate the  regulators more  from  the  executive and
legislative branches by  recognizing  them  as  an  independent entity  in
government and  institutionalizing them  in  the  form,  though not  the
substance, of  courts.”
## [440]
The  creation of  the  Department of  Health,

Education, and Welfare in 1953 established a permanent bureaucracy for the
administration of  the  welfare and social engineering functions of  the
managerial state.
In foreign affairs and defense policy, the National Security Act of 1947
established the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff under it
and  the  Central  Intelligence Agency and  the  National Security Council
under the presidency. The bureaucratic apparatus created in this legislation
went far to commit the United States to a globalist defense and foreign
policy under the control of the presidency and the managers associated with
it, but it also acted as a constraint on irregular or excessive international
policies and action (“adventurism”) and encouraged the bureaucratization
and routinization of global policy. A parallel development occurred in the
Department of State with the creation of the Policy Planning Staff under
Secretary of  State George  Marshall  for  the  planning and  projection of
American foreign policy in the future. The offices of the Staff were adjacent
to that of the Secretary, and under its first director, George F.  Kennan, it
played a major role in designing the policy of containment, which in the era
of managerial consolidation committed the United States to global activism
(in  contrast  and  in  opposition to  bourgeois  nationalist and  isolationist
policies) but also to the limitation of global commitments. In the United
Nations Participation Act of 1945, Congress acknowledged the president’s
authority to commit U.S.    troops to military actions under the U.N.    Charter
without prior congressional approval, and the same authority was granted in
the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty. President Truman successfully
used  this  power in  committing American troops to  the Korean conflict,
despite strong congressional opposition.
## [441]
The  legal  and  political relationships between the  central and  local

governments and  the  executive and  legislative branches also  tended to
consolidate the power of the managerial presidency and the bureaucratic
elite under it. The Twenty-second Amendment to the Constitution restricted
the president to two terms of office, but, while it limited the degree to which
a charismatic leader could protract his control of the executive branch, it did
nothing to reduce the power of the office itself. Reliance on the veto to
control legislative enactments became a major instrument of the presidency.
Franklin Roosevelt used the veto power 631 times in the course of his
presidency—more than any other president—and was the first president to
veto a revenue bill. President Truman used the veto 250 times in seven
years, while Eisenhower exercised it 98 times in his first three years in
office. By contrast, seven of the first sixteen presidents never used the veto,
and the other nine used it only 48 times. The resistance of the executive to
legislative power was paralleled by the increase in Supreme Court decisions
striking down congressional actions as unconstitutional. Between 1900 and
1940 the Court delivered 49 opinions declaring congressional legislation
unconstitutional, in contrast to only two such decisions prior to the Civil
War and about 20 between 1865 and 1900. Since the 1940s, the rejection of
congressional (as well as state and local) legislation as unconstitutional has
become commonplace.
## [442]
While the Supreme Court limited the expansion of presidential power in
domestic affairs in its rejection of Roosevelt’s National Industrial Recovery
Administration and  Truman’s  seizure of  the  steel  industry in  1952  as
unconstitutional, it  recognized the  expanded role  of  the  presidency in
foreign affairs. In the case of U.S. v.  Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation in
1936, the Court accepted the “plenary and exclusive power of the President
as the sole organ of the federal government in foreign relations,” a power
“which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of Congress.”
## [443]

The Court from the 1930s became more subservient to the executive branch
and its decisions increasingly conformed to managerial values and interests.
Franklin Roosevelt’s “court packing bill,” despite its rejection by Congress,
and his subsequent appointment of five Supreme Court justices within three
years  precipitated what  became  “the  crucial turning point  in  modern
constitutional history.”  The  Court’s  expansive interpretation of  the
commerce clause of  the  Constitution, even  before Roosevelt’s  new
appointments, “launched the  Court on  its  new  affirmative course of
applying, implementing, and extending federal economic power,” while the
development of the “incorporation doctrine,” by which the Bill of Rights
could be  used  to  strike down state  and  local  statutes, instituted a
“nationalization of the Bill of Rights against the states.”
## [444]
The Court thus
became an  effective instrument of  managerial forces by  which  local,
bourgeois resistance in local and congressional institutions to centralized
managerial power and cultural homogenization could be overcome.
The continuing erosion of congressional, state and local, and private and
social power (generally the political bases of the bourgeois sub-elite) in
relationship to the executive, central, and public power of the managerial
state was evident in the 1940s and 1950s in the expansion of foreign and
domestic intelligence  functions under  the  CIA  and  FBI,  of  government
secrecy, and of the claims of executive privilege in conflicts between the
executive branch  and  congressional investigatory committees. Although
these executive powers had expanded during World War II, their retention
and acceptance in law, court decisions, and the deference of congressional
and political leaders in the post-War era represented a crystallization of
executive power on a permanent basis in peacetime. The growth of the
federal budget in  the  amount of  money authorized and  expended, the
technicality and complexity of governmental functions, and the inability of

congressional authorities to  comprehend and  evaluate the  budget
intelligently contributed to  the  yielding of  the  budgetary powers by
Congress and  their  effective transfer to  the  presidency.  Moreover,  the
executive branch possessed a number of devices by which its control of the
budget and public expenditures were maintained.
Even with respect to the squabbles on secondary points, Congress has no effective means
to  enforce  its  fiscal  decisions on  the  executive, to  discover whether these  have  been
faithfully carried out, or to punish the bureaucracy and the executive if there have been
violations. By such devices as have already been mentioned—transfer of appropriations,
coercive deficiencies, manipulation of unexpended balances, vaguely defined lump sum
appropriations, government corporations with separate bookkeeping—plus the expanding
use of contingent and discretionary funds, and the spread of secret agencies (like the
Central Intelligence Agency) with deliberately concealed budgets: by these and a dozen
other tools in the accountants’ box, the bureaucracy has to a very considerable degree freed
its fiscal operations from congressional bonds.
## [445]
Moreover,  the  presidency increasingly “stood out,” in  Arthur
Schlesinger’s phrase, “in solitary majesty as the central focus of political
emotion, the  ever  more  potent symbol of  national community.”
## [446]
## The
presidency was  thus  able  not  only  to  mobilize political, economic, law
enforcement, intelligence, military, and international resources but also to
manipulate mass  emotions and  loyalties and  thereby to  transcend and
circumvent the intermediary institutions of the bourgeois order and appeal
directly and effectively to the mass population through overtures to public
opinion, popular mandates, national security, and the “national purpose.”
Truman’s attempt to seize the steel industry, his direct appeal to the mass
population in the 1948 election, and his dismissal of General MacArthur
were all instances of the use of the presidency not only as the locus of
national leadership but also as an instrument against bourgeois interests,
beliefs, values, and  institutions and  were  consistent with  managerial
interests, as was Eisenhower’s use of federal troops in the desegregation of
Little Rock public schools. The overriding of private property in the public

interest in  the  steel  industry seizure, the  appeal to  the  masses  against
bourgeois  political resistance in  the  1948  campaign, the  limitation of
military efforts in Korea, and the centralized enforcement of federal laws at
the expense of state and local authority all reflected the enduring interests
and ideology of the managerial elite against those of the declining elite of
the bourgeois order.
Despite the  persistence of  Caesarist elements in  the  role  of  the
presidency as  a  locus  of  national  leadership, the  consolidation of  the
executive and bureaucratic functions of the mass state under the control of
its managerial elite reduced the dependence of the elite on the charisma of
individual presidents and the national and international emergencies of war
and  depression that  had  created  opportunities for  the  acquisition of
managerial power.  Managerial consolidation of  power in  the  state  thus
perpetuated the  power of  the  presidency as  it  had  been  developed by
Roosevelt in the emergent phase of the managerial revolution, but it also
subordinated and  transformed this  charismatic, Caesarist power by
embodying it in permanent and bureaucratic structures, depersonalizing it,
and  regularizing and  limiting it  in  law  and  administrative routine. The
regularization of  managerial power in  the  state,  as  in  the  economy,
prevented it from being jeopardized by excessive or irregular expansion,
permitted it  to  be  used  in  the  interests of  all  sectors of  the  new  elite,
removed it  beyond the  reach  of  bourgeois  forces, and  established the
institutional base for further expansion and acceleration at the appropriate
time.
The managerial consolidation of power in the economy and government
was not complete, however. Bourgeois forces retained considerable power
through the  Congress and  state  and  local  governments as  well  as  in

entrepreneurial sectors of the economy, and in the late 1940s and 1950s
they mounted a counter-attack on managerial structures and policies. The
persistence of  bourgeois  beliefs  and  habits of  thought among many
Americans and  even  among many managers assisted the  bourgeois
resistance and retarded the progress of managerial consolidation. Bourgeois
interests, however, were largely concentrated on domestic and economic
issues. They displayed comparatively little interest in foreign affairs, except
to  resist  the  international activism that  the  managerial elite  sought to
institutionalize; nor  did  bourgeois  elements possess much  control or
oversight of the conduct of foreign policy. While managerial consolidation
in  domestic affairs  was  sometimes  successfully resisted or  modified by
bourgeois efforts, then, the new elite was most successful in consolidating
its control of foreign and defense policies, which it used to institutionalize a
globalist orientation that corresponded to its interests as an elite.

The Consolidation of Managerial
## Globalism
The commitment of the managerial elite to globalist or internationalist
foreign policy develops from  the  colossal scale  and  span  of  the  mass
organizations under  its  control. Multinational corporations operate on  a
global scale with financial assets and resources that rival those of sovereign
states and perform functions that transcend the legal, political, and social
boundaries of states. The mass organizations of culture and communication
are able to communicate with and to integrate on a verbal and symbolic
level large masses of human beings that transcend conventional national
and cultural barriers and categories, and the prospect of global coordination
through mass communications technology became possible with  the
technological and organizational advances of the 20th century. The mass
state itself is part of an interdependent global complex of other mass states
and  transnational structures, each  of  which contains mass  populations,
commands massive  amounts of  economic resources, spans  massive
distances and  territories, and  controls massive levels of  lethal  force.
Whether mass  states  are  in  conflict or  comity with  each  other,  their
relationships are conducted by managerial groups through the instruments
of mass organizations (armed forces, intelligence services, diplomatic and
commercial bureaucracies, and  regional and  transnational organizations)
and are dependent on the technical and managerial skills of these groups.
The managerial regime and the mass organizations of which it is composed
therefore cannot operate within the  constraints of  the  traditional nation-
state.  Their  tendency is  either  to  break  down  and  replace  traditional
nationalist organization or to adapt it to new functions consistent with the

interests and imperatives of the elite.
In the hard managerial regimes, the tendencies of the regime to break
down and expand beyond traditional national constraints take the form of
imperialism, conquest through war, and absorption of physical territories by
the  apparatus of  the  regime. Although J.A.    Hobson, Lenin, and  their
followers regard the  globalism  of  the  soft  managerial regimes and  its
predecessor under  financial capitalism as  a  form  of  imperialism, the
expansionary tendencies of  soft  managerialism are  distinct from  the
imperialism of prescriptive and bourgeois societies as well as from that of
hard  managerial  regimes. In  the  soft  regimes, the  tendencies toward
expansion are present, though military conquest and formal annexation are
far less common and indeed almost unknown, and the soft regimes employ
military force reluctantly and usually only for defensive purposes in what
appear to be emergencies or through miscalculations of policy. Managerial
globalism does not rely on force or coercive means for its expansion, as
imperialism historically has, nor does it seek the formal political absorption
of new territories and populations or the development of colonies of its own
population. Soft managerial regimes expand organizationally, through the
organized manipulation of  the  economies, societies, cultures, and
governments of  nations and  regions that  are  formally outside their
apparatus. Managerial globalism thus tends to assimilate non-managerial
societies by developing the infra-structures of mass organizations in the
states, economies, and  cultures  of  local  areas  and  by  instigating the
emergence  of  local  managerial elites.  New  managerial regimes  are  thus
integrated into  the  global economy,  communications networks, and
transnational political structures under managerial dominance. The goal of
the elite is not the physical conquest of foreign territories and populations
but their assimilation—as homogenized mass markets, mass audiences, and

world citizens—within the structures of mass organizations.
Moreover,  managerial globalism, unlike imperialism in  the  Hobson-
Lenin theory, is only in part economically motivated. Its principal impetus
is  the  inherent expansionist dynamic of  managerial elites, which must
continually promote the enlargement of mass organizations and the role of
managerial functions in order to secure and enhance their own rewards and
power.  Thus,  the  expansionist force  in  managerial globalism is  not  the
nation from which the managerial elite derives nor any political-cultural
entity, as in historic imperialism, but the elite itself, which increasingly
becomes an autonomous global force, transnational and cosmopolitan in its
ideology and  interests and,  even  in  the  developed managerial societies,
increasingly alienated from  the  historic institutions and  values  of  pre-
managerial society.  Indeed, so  far  from  representing the  imperialist
expansion of  the  United States  or  other  Western nations, managerial
globalism promotes the erosion of national power and national identity in
the face of the expansion of the power of the transnational managerial elite
and its apparatus of mass organizations.
The cosmopolitan elements of managerial ideology correspond to and
reflect the managerial interests in transnational, supranational, and globalist
operations. Just as mass organizations in the state, economy, and culture
within a society tend to break down and homogenize the traditional and
bourgeois  institutions and  systems of  beliefs and  values,  so  on  a
transnational scale they tend to break down and homogenize the traditional
cultures and  institutions of  non-managerial societies. Managerial forces
instigate the  replacement of  traditional social forms and  beliefs by  a
cosmopolitan identity that abandons or minimizes national, social, class,
tribal, racial, religious, and kinship identities and substitutes a collective,

universalist, and  cosmopolitan  identity as  “man,” “humanity,”
“humankind,” “one world,” or “the global village.” The response to the
homogenizing, cosmopolitan, globalist tendencies of Western managerial
regimes in non-Western societies has been the differentiation of small parts
of the population from the larger society as a local managerial elite and the
development of  reactive movements against the  managerial West  in  the
form  of  messianic religious cults,  charismatic leaders, and  extreme
nationalist, racialist, authoritarian, and militarist regimes that mobilize the
society against Western influences while making practical use of Western
technological and managerial resources. What Barry Rubin calls “modern
dictatorship” in  Third  World  political cultures developed as  a  result  of
Western technological, economic, and managerial modernization.
[M[odern dictatorships do not stem from underdevelopment but rather are products of the
modernization process itself. As the Third World adopted statehood, telecommunications,
modern dress,  assembly lines, United Nations membership, professional  armies, and
twentieth-century business methods, it reshaped and reinterpreted these things to fit the
existing culture. . . . The point here is that change was neither as total nor as Westernizing
as had been predicted. Instead, the result was a hybrid of traditional society and imported
new  ideas  and  material  goods to  produce something quite  new.  Traditional political
structures were “modernized” into new forms of authoritarian rule.
## [447]
In short, the result of the efforts of the soft managerial regimes to unify
non-managerial societies through the expansion of modernization has been
the development of hard managerial regimes with shallow roots in their
societies, hostile to Western soft managerialism, and alienated from their
own culture and populations.
The globalist tendencies of the managerial regime in the United States
were  evident as  early  as  the  imperialism of Theodore Roosevelt,  under
whom managerialism appeared to  be  developing as  an  incipient hard
regime, but they acquired forms more consistent with the nature of soft
managerialism in the rhetoric and policies of Woodrow Wilson. Bourgeois

resistance to the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations rejected the
cosmopolitan and  globalist framework of  Wilson’s  foreign policy,  and
managerial elements that shared Wilson’s goals were unable to assert or
implement them openly until the advent of the Second World War.
In the aftermath of World War I, progressivist liberalism retreated from
the  internationalism of  Wilson,  but  advocates of  international activism
organized themselves into  the Institute for  International Affairs  ,  which
contained British as  well  as  American diplomats, intellectuals, and
businessmen who had worked on the Versailles settlement, and the Council
on Foreign Relations (CFR) in New York. The two organizations merged in
1921  under  the  title  of  the  latter  group, and  throughout the  1920s its
members sought  to  establish its  authority on  foreign policy  among
businessmen, politicians, and intellectual leaders. It included politicians of
both parties and exponents of a variety of schools of thought, and under the
label of educating and informing the public about world affairs the CFR
played a major role in popularizing and pressing for an abandonment of
“isolationism.” It  sought to  promote reconciliation between the  Soviet
Union and the United States, opposed protective tariffs, and in the 1930s,
with  financial aid  from  the  Carnegie Corporation, sought to  dispel
isolationist sentiment in the nation through the creation of local Councils on
Foreign Relations throughout the country. The CFR exerted considerable
influence on Franklin Roosevelt and his foreign policy, and its studies on
national self-sufficiency led to the establishment of the Export-Import Bank
and Trade Agreements Act of 1934.
As the war drew to a close, Council members—in study groups and within the government
—played leading roles  in  planning the  architecture of  the  postwar world: the
reconstruction of  Germany and  Japan,  the  founding of  the  United Nations, the
establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
## [448]

The  CFR  was  not,  however,  merely a  group  of  concerned citizens
committed to international activism. By the 1950s it was heavily dependent
on financial contributions from the larger managerial corporations, financial
institutions, and foundations,
## [449]
and its early history reflects considerable
influence by  J.P.  Morgan  and  Company.  “The  Morgan  Bank,” wrote
historian Carroll Quigley,
has never made any real effort to conceal its position in regard to the Council on Foreign
Relations. The list of officers and board of directors are printed in every issue of Foreign
Affairs  and  have  always been  loaded with  partners, associates, and  employees of
J.P. Mor gan and Company.
## [450]
The British counterpart to the CFR, the Royal Institute for International
Affairs, was the creation of a group centered around Alfred Milner, who,
Quigley noted, “was an early example of what James Burnham has called
‘the  managerial revolution’.”
## [451]
Although the  Morgan  interests properly
belong to  the  large-scale financial capitalism that  preceded managerial
oligopoly,  they  underwent much  the  same  processes of  organizational
enlargement and the separation of ownership and control that precipitated
the managerial revolution in non-financial enterprises, and the Morgan bank
was particularly influential in instigating the managerial revolution in the
economy. “By installing professional managers—with no proprietary stakes
themselves in the enterprise,” writes Daniel Bell, “unable therefore to pass
along their power automatically to their sons, and accountable to outside
controllers—the bankers effected a  radical separation of  property and
family.”
## [452]
The business interests represented in the CFR have therefore
been almost exclusively managerial or closely related financial capitalist
interests, and the intellectuals and political leaders associated with it have
usually been  drawn from  the  managerial intelligentsia of  the  larger
universities and foundations and have represented managerial interests in
government.

The  international activism that  the  CFR  advocated and  sustained
between 1919 and 1945 was thus largely an expression of the organizational
interests of the managerial elite. Commercial intercourse with the Soviet
Union, free  trade,  and  the  coordination of  international commercial and
financial relations reflected the  global interests and  operations  of  the
managerial elite in mass corporations. The expansion and coordination of
international political, economic, and military power reflected the interests
of the elite of the managerial state, and the activism of state and corporation
on a global scale created increasing demands and rewards for the verbal and
technical skills of  the  managerial intelligentsia. Ideological themes
associated with progressivism and cosmopolitanism—world peace, human
progress, human rights, and international community—also reflected these
interests and contributed to the expansion of the managerial state through its
global activism in foreign policy.
The end of the Second World War, which James Burnham had called
“the first great war of managerial society,”
## [453]
brought the soft managerial
regime in  the  United States an  effective global hegemony.  The  sudden
acquisition of  global power confronted the  managerial regime  with  the
challenge of assimilating and organizing it. Persistent bourgeois forces in
American political life  expressed skepticism about the  prospects of
continued internationalism and the erosion of national sovereignty that such
global power would involve, and these forces resisted policies, treaties, and
legislation that  drew  the  country out  of  its  isolationism and  into  the
transnational commitments of the new regime.
Bourgeois resistance to globalism conjoined with the managerial need to
assimilate global power to facilitate consolidation of the hegemony of the
managerial regime and the establishment of instruments for preserving and

organizing it. The United Nations, the Bretton Woods Agreement, the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, and similar transnational structures provided
the machinery for preserving and gradually extending managerial global
dominance and for moving away from traditional and bourgeois concepts of
the  self-sufficient, sovereign nation-state conducting a  foreign policy in
accord with its “national interests.” The new transnational structures were
founded on  the  cosmopolitan premise that  “national interest” should be
subordinated to the interests of a larger identity. It was a premise contained
in the preamble of the founding document of the Institute for International
## Affairs:
Until recent years it was usual to assume that in foreign affairs each government must
think mainly, if not entirely, of the interests of its own people. In founding the League of
Nations, the Allied Powers have now recognized that national policies ought to be framed
with an eye to the welfare of Society at large.
## [454]
The subordination of national interests to those of “Society at large”
paralleled the subordination of individual economic interests to collective
interests that  characterized the  fusion of state  and  economy within the
managerial regime. It  was  an  idea  also  that  lay  at  the  root  of  the
International Military Tribunal and its trials of Nazi officials in Nuremberg.
The concept of “crimes against humanity,” undefined in the existing legal
codes of nation-states, established a precedent for the internationalization of
law and the further subordination and erosion of national sovereignty.
The principal formulation of managerial globalism {in the West} in the
period of consolidation, however, was the policy of “containment” {aimed
at  Russian Soviet Communism}, generally associated with  George
F.  Kennan, its  chief  architect and  exponent.
## [455]
Kennan  provided a
conceptual framework for containment in terms of “national interest,” thus
modifying the progressivist and internationalist premises of globalism and

making globalism compatible with the muted progressivist assumptions of
consensus liberalism. Despite the  appeal to  national interest, however,
Kennan was  able  to  re-define the  term  to  minimize considerations of
bourgeois  as  well  as  managerial  ideology and  to  limit  it  to  “non-
ideological” and  “pragmatic” ends.  By  diminishing the  role  of  what  he
called “the legalistic-moralistic approach to international problems” and of
ethics and idealistic considerations in the conduct of foreign affairs, Kennan
not  only  modified the  progressivist  content of  foreign policy but  also
reduced the role of traditional bourgeois ideas involving “national honor,”
the constitutional legitimacy and propriety of international commitments,
and  the  preservation of  national sovereignty and  autonomy.  Kennan’s
“pragmatic” assessment of  the  Soviet Union and  the  world  led  to  the
rejection of  an  immediate “rollback,” “liberation,” or  “victory over
communism” as impractical and dangerous and to recognition of the need
for continuing commitment and intervention on a global scale. The conflict
with the Soviet Union was thus a permanent and complex aspect of world
affairs.
[T]he patient persistence by which it [Soviet diplomacy] is animated means that it can be
effectively countered not  by  sporadic acts  which represent the  momentary whims of
democratic opinion but only by intelligent long-range policies on the part of Russia’s
adversaries—policies no  less  steady in  their  purpose, and  no  less  variegated in  their
application, than those of the Soviet Union itself.
In these circumstances, it is clear that the main element of any United States policy toward
the Soviet Union must be that of a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of
Russian expansive tendencies.
## [456]
Kennan’s rejection of a crusade against Communist power by military
action implied a  reliance on  what  he  called the  “effective use  of  the
principle of professionalism in the conduct of foreign policy . . . [by] a
corps of professional officers superior to anything that exists or has existed
in this field.”
## [457]
The function of such professional experts, drawn from the

managerial intelligentsia and  the  managerial  bureaucracy and  insulated
from the vagaries of democratic politics and public opinion, would be to
understand, interpret, explain, negotiate, and  manage foreign policy in
general and containment in particular. In presupposing that containment of
the  Soviets  would require professionalism, firmness, intelligence, long-
range planning, and patience, Kennan provided a formula that rationalized
the  dominance of American foreign  policy by  an  elite  that  supposedly
exhibited these virtues and  skills and  shunned “diplomacy by
dilettantism,”
## [458]
was  removed from  politics, and  was  fused  with  the
managerial state.
Containment as a whole also provided a rationalization for a continuing
and deepening involvement, almost purely managerial in nature, in world
affairs  and  for  the  regularization of  such  involvement by  excluding
prolonged or  major military conflicts as  well  as  by  concentrating on
Western Europe rather than on regions already under communist control
(the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe) or about to come under communist
control (China and  the  Far  East). Moreover,  containment  and  its
implications, regardless of Kennan’s formulation and intentions, in practice
incorporated the basic premises of progressivist liberalism. “The sensible
program for the United States,” wrote Eric Goldman in describing the goals
of containment, “was a positive effort to create healthy societies, primarily
through economic aid.”
## [459]
Containment therefore presupposed the
scientistic and  melioristic premises of  managerial liberalism in  its
commitment to the goal of creating healthy societies by the application of
managerial science to human social arrangements, and the policy provided a
rationalization of  the  material interests of  the  managerial elite  by
legitimizing the enhancement of the power and rewards of the elite through
the application on a global scale of its specialized skills.

The  containment policy was  especially well-suited for  the  soft
managerial regime because it tended to avoid military confrontation and the
use of force and relied on skills and resources—economic, technological,
verbal, and managerial—that the soft regime could provide. By minimizing
the role of military force in international policy and restricting it to “police
actions” and defensive purposes, the new formula of managerial globalism
corresponded to the patterns of behavior typical of the prevalent Class I
residues in  the  soft  managerial  elite.  The  concept of  the  “causes” of
communism presupposed by  containment reflected the  environmentalist
premises of  managerial liberalism,  and  these  premises pointed to  the
“solution” of  the  problem of  communist expansion. “The  seeds  of
totalitarian regimes,” said  President Truman in  announcing the  Truman
Doctrine on  March 12,  1947,  “are  nurtured by  misery and  want.  They
spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife,” and “I believe that
our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid, which is
essential to economic stability and orderly political processes.”
Managerial reconstruction of  global society was  initiated under  the
Marshall Plan and Truman’s Point Four program of exporting managerial
skills  and  knowledge to  undeveloped societies. Jonathan Bingham, an
administrator of the latter project, expressed its meliorist and scientistic
elements:
What makes Point 4 different from the ordinary concept of economic aid
and makes it so infinitely appealing is that it emphasizes the distribution of
knowledge rather than of money. Obviously there is not money enough in
the world to relieve the suffering of the peoples of the underdeveloped
areas, but . . . there is, for the first time in history, enough knowledge to do
the job. This is indeed an exciting, even a revolutionary idea.
## [460]

The  application of  “knowledge”—i.e., managerial skills—to human
suffering would result in the amelioration of human society and assimilate
“underdeveloped areas”—the term  presupposes the  normative status  of
“developed” or managerial societies, to which “underdeveloped” societies
are to aspire—within the global framework of the managerial regime.
The  Eisenhower administration continued and  even  expanded  the
foreign aid programs that became one of the main vehicles of managerial
globalism, and  it  also  retained the  basic  ideas  of  containment—the
acceptance of Soviet power as an enduring fact of international life, the
avoidance of direct military confrontation and of an unlimited “rollback”
policy, and the belief that economic and social change under managerial
supervision would reduce the appeal of communism outside the Soviet bloc.
Although many corporate managers and organs of business opinion retained
isolationist beliefs and were skeptical of foreign aid, continuing military
expenditures, and international activism, President Eisenhower himself
like many another leader whose political career was forged during the Second World War,
believed that private enterprise and public authority, working together, now had the duty to
export American capital, technology, skills, and managerial techniques in order to foster
economic, social, and political stability in the noncommunist world.
## [461]
The Committee for Economic Development also consistently supported
foreign aid  and  international activism. “Throughout the  1950s, CED
spokesmen enunciated constant support for global assistance projects and
the  necessity for  federal involvement in  them.”
## [462]
By  the  end  of  the
Eisenhower presidency,  corporate managers had  become far  more
supportive of foreign assistance programs, especially those that appeared to
develop “basic economic facilities—transportation, utilities, sanitation—in
areas unattractive to foreign investment,” in the words of a CED policy
statement.
## [463]
By the end of the 1950s,

The  program  of  foreign economic aid  begun under Truman had  been  broadened
substantially by Eisenhower. Truman had created a Marshall Plan for Western Europe.
Eisenhower created a Marshall Plan for the world. In both cases, the Presidents and their
legislative branch allies enjoyed the backing of the CED and (somewhat more reluctantly)
the Business Council, in expanding federal power out into the world to help contain the
communist menace. In supporting Ike’s foreign aid effort—as in sustaining that of Truman
before him—big-business  politicians had  once  again  learned that  a  large  and  activist
government was a tool that they, too, could use.
## [464]
The post-War era thus saw a consolidation of the institutions and ideas
of managerial globalism, a system by which the new elite assimilated and
stabilized the global power it had acquired and by which it could extend its
international power  in  the  future.  Although the  foreign policies and
international commitments that  developed in  the  1940s and  1950s
established a permanent involvement in and leadership of the world, and
though they  were  resisted strongly by  bourgeois  elements that  retained
isolationist or  nationalist interests and  preconceptions, the  adaptation of
managerial globalism in the post-War period to a system that consolidated
rather than expanded managerial global power was something of a retreat
from  the  more  aggressive international policy that  characterized the
emergent period of the managerial regime. Advocates of globalism in the
period of  consolidation muted the  cosmopolitan themes of  progressivist
ideology that Woodrow Wilson had articulated, and they formulated their
defense of global activism by appeal to a “national interest” that resembled
traditional or bourgeois beliefs. Architects of containment withdrew from
the unlimited crusading attitudes that had characterized Wilson’s foreign
policy and  rhetoric and  emphasized the  limits of  American power.
Containment also acknowledged Soviet power and communist control of
China as enduring facts of international life that could not be altered by
naive military adventures, in contrast to the pre-World War II determination
to eradicate Axis power in Europe as well as Asia. The ideas of containment
thus  resembled the  adaptation of  progressivism that  underlay consensus

liberalism, and the more modest goals that containment and related policies
professed were consistent with the interests of the managerial elite in the
period of its consolidation. The globalism of the managerial regime as it
was developed in this period was thus a limitation and a consolidation of
globalist activism, and  it  provided the  first  signs  of  the  risk-aversive
tendencies that characterize mature elites and, when carried to an extreme,
result in cultural and political stagnation.
The 1940s and 1950s were a period in which the new managerial elite in
the  United States successfully consolidated its  power through the
perpetuation of mass organizations in the economy, culture, and state and
adapted its  ideology and  behavior to  the  need  for  consolidation. It
developed national and  global structures and  policies and  a  national
consensus that enabled it to assimilate the massive resources and power it
had  acquired, and  it  temporarily  reduced or  withdrew from  further
expansion in order to ensure the survival of its apparatus of control. It made
use of the mass state to secure its power through legislative and policy
enactments, but its power also extended outside the state in the dominant
organizations of the economy as well as in the mass organizations of culture
and communication. The expansion of mass education and the development
of  new  techniques of  mass  communication in  television provided
instruments for  the  further disciplining and  integration of  the  mass
population by the managerial intelligentsia.
Yet, toward the end of the 1950s, a number of internal pressures began
to  accumulate  that  pushed for  an  acceleration of  social change under
managerial direction. Economic recession in 1957 and 1958 led to demands
for a more aggressive management of the economy than Eisenhower and
the Republican Party were prepared to undertake. The Soviet launching of

Sputnik in 1957 precipitated demands for further development of scientific
and technological education, resources, and innovation with governmental
assistance. The beginnings of the civil rights movement created demands
for social and ideological change that would challenge persistent bourgeois
beliefs and  power at  the  local  level  and  throughout society,  as  did  the
discovery of poverty as a social problem by Michael Harrington and others.
John Kenneth Galbraith in The Affluent Society criticized the mass pursuit
of  consumer goods, largely  a  creation of  managerial capitalism, as  an
outmoded remnant of  pre-managerial economies and  called for  a
reorientation of values toward public expenditures for education, health,
scientific and technological progress, and the elimination of poverty and
inequality. Walter Lippmann and other critics of the era of consolidation
called for a national commitment to “great purposes.” The demands and
pressures for a resumption of innovation, reform, and acceleration derived
largely  from  the  managerial elite,  were  articulated by  the  managerial
intelligentsia, and  pointed toward ideas,  policies, and  organizations that
would further  enhance the  power,  status, and  rewards of  the  elite.  The
particular pressures for  the  acceleration of  the  regime  were  the
manifestation of the inherent tendency to expand and promote social change
under the direction and control of the elite.
The  Kennedy administration was  committed to  the  resumption of
managerial acceleration and entered office with the support of the elite or
eager to have its support and to promote its agenda and its interests. Both
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson presided over a concerted effort to expand
managerial power at all levels of society and throughout the world. The
period of acceleration was to be, in the words of the poem written by the
senescent Robert Frost to celebrate its beginning, “a golden age of poetry
and power,” in which the poetry of revived progressivist optimism would

conjoin with the power of the managerial regime to promote and manage
the amelioration of mankind. Within a few years of its inception, however,
the golden age would collapse before the assaults of ideological movements
of left and right that rejected the managerial consensus and represented the
first major resistance to the managerial elite and its regime.

## ACCELERATION AND
## RESISTANCE
The Dynamic of Acceleration
Virtually all elites seek to consolidate and crystallize their power and to
resist challenges to the institutions on which their power rests. The elite of
the  soft  managerial regime is  no  exception, and  after  the  period of  its
emergence in the Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II, it too
began to  retreat from  the  innovative and  expansive tendencies that  it
originally displayed and to stabilize and perpetuate its power in permanent
institutional forms. Unlike most other elites of the past, however, the soft
managerial elite cannot remain permanently in a phase of consolidation and
stability. Its power rests ultimately on the application of managerial skills in
the mass organizations of the state, economy, and culture; and the larger, the
more  complex, and  the  more  extensive these  organizations become, the
more  power and  rewards will  accrue to  those  groups skilled in  the
techniques by which these organizations are operated and directed.
The soft managerial elite thus possesses a vital interest in continuing to
encourage the  enlargement of  its  mass  organizations and  in  continually
extending their reach, and this interest, as well as the very momentum of
expansion and enlargement, generates within the mass organizations of the
regime tendencies of continuous enlargement and a continuous extension of
the scope of their power. These tendencies mean that political jurisdictions
and authorities, sectors of the economy, and cultural institutions that lie

outside the reach of mass organizations are absorbed within the regime as
the organizations expand. The dynamic of enlargement also insures that the
managerial regime will be in continual conflict with non-managerial forces
and institutions, that the managerial intelligentsia will continually formulate
new rationalizations for the need for enlargement and for the absorption of
non-managerial elements, and  that  these  rationalizations will  seek  to
discredit non-managerial ideologies. The  dynamic of  enlargement also
means that pressures for a continuing process of innovation will develop.
The enlargement of mass organizations involves the expanding application
of  managerial techniques and  skills  to  social, political, economic, and
cultural relationships and institutions, the discrediting of old relationships
and  institutions, and  their  re-organization by  means of  the  skills  and
functions that the elite performs. As Kevin Phillips has argued, there is a
close  relationship between the  “knowledge elite,” the  “managers and
theoreticians who  deal  in  ideas  and  methods,” and  “accelerated social
change.”
## [465]
The soft managerial regime is thus engaged in a process of
continuous and permanent revolution, innovation, and social change that
reinforces and enhances the dominance of its elite and challenges the power
of  non-managerial groups that  resist  innovation and  absorption. This
process is consistent with the manipulative personality type and patterns of
behavior that  characterize the  soft  managerial elite.  It  is  because the
members of  the  soft  managerial elite  are  predisposed to  and  skilled in
manipulative rather  than  coercive  styles  of  power that  they  are  able  to
exploit the processes of enlargement and innovation to their own advantage
and the enhancement of their own power as an elite.
The dependence of the soft managerial elite on continuing enlargement
and social change means that it can never become thoroughly conservative
and that the period of consolidation in which it seeks to stabilize its power

must be limited and temporary. While conservation and perpetuation of the
mass structures on which the power of the elite rests is in the interest of the
elite, the elite and the structures themselves cannot remain secure unless
they continue to expand and to generate social change. The bureaucratic
elite  of  the  mass  state,  skilled in  the  design and  management of social
engineering through the administrative and legal apparatus of government,
must seek new social and economic problems to solve. The elite of the mass
corporations, skilled in the mass production and distribution of goods and
services, must  develop new  goods  and  services and  new  methods of
producing and distributing them. The elite of the mass organizations of
culture and  communication, skilled in  the  techniques of  mass
communication and manipulation, must invent and disseminate new ideas,
information, tastes, and values. The structures by which these innovations
are implemented remain intact, however, and while the elite possesses a
vital  interest in  conserving and  perpetuating these  structures, it  also
possesses an equally vital interest in using them to promote innovation and
in continuing to enlarge them.
These two  general interests are  capable of  creating a  dilemma  or
contradiction within the soft managerial regime, for it is possible that the
process of innovation will generate changes that threaten or challenge the
mass organizations and their elite. This possibility means that the process of
innovation is  not  unlimited, and  the  boundaries of  the  “pluralism” and
“open society,”  which the  ideological formulations of  the  soft  regime
defend, are found precisely at that point where innovation or variety might
jeopardize the  basic  structures  and  mechanisms of  the  regime and  the
interests of the elite.
After the emergence of the managerial elite as a dominant minority in

the wake of the Depression and the Second World War, the soft managerial
regime entered a period of consolidation in which it sought successfully to
perpetuate and stabilize its power. By the end of the 1950s, however, the
dynamic of  continuing expansion, enlargement, and  innovation created
irresistible demands for  the  acceleration of  the  regime. These demands
arose  from  the  interests of  the  managerial elite  itself,  and  they  found
political expression in the administrations of Presidents John F.  Kennedy
and Lyndon Johnson and in the domestic and foreign policies, rhetoric, and
imagery associated with them. In many respects, the period of acceleration
resembled the  period of  emergence of  the  managerial elite  and  the
formation of  its  regime. In  the  Kennedy-Johnson era,  the  Caesarist
tendencies of the managerial state reappeared after a period of routinization,
and these tendencies were coupled with political efforts to enlarge the mass
base  of  the  managerial state  and  to  extend its  scope. In  this  era  also,
managerial globalism became more assertive, and the period witnessed an
intense effort to extend the soft managerial regime on a global scale, in
contrast to the more passive globalism of the period of consolidation under
Truman and Eisenhower. Culturally and ideologically, the early 1960s saw a
revival of  explicit progressivist  themes that  were  reminiscent of  the
orientation of managerial thought toward challenge and conflict during the
period of managerial emergence. The size and scope of mass organizations
in the economy and culture as well as the state also expanded in the 1960s,
and the three sectors of the managerial regime became increasingly fused or
integrated.
While the  period of  acceleration  of  the  1960s began as  a  kind  of
managerial renaissance, a  golden age  of  centralized, technocratic, and
utopian planning that sought to satisfy the aspirations of the elite for further
enlargement, it ended in what appeared to many members of the elite as the

beginning of a new dark age, with the apparent breakdown or failure of
many managerial policies and with the emergence of new political forces
that challenged the regime and its claims to power. These forces—the New
Left  of  the  1960s  and  what  came  to  be  called  in  the  1970s  the  “New
Right”—were largely the product of the managerial regime itself, and their
appearance illustrates the propensity of the process of continuing innovation
that is necessary to the soft regime to generate forces hostile to the regime.
Since the challenges issued by the New Left and the New Right, the soft
managerial regime has been unable to recover fully, and since the late 1960s
it has sought to assimilate and deflect these two challenges. Hence, the
regime has been forced into a protracted period of consolidation and has
been unable to accelerate at the rate its elite demands. On the one hand, the
conflict between the need to deal with the challenges to the regime through
consolidation and  assimilation, and,  on  the  other,  the  need  to  continue
acceleration—enlargement, expansion, and innovation—has resulted in an
increasingly profound crisis of the soft managerial regime.

The Acceleration of the Managerial
## Regime
In the late 1960s a series of events created opportunities and incentives
for the managerial elite in the United States to press for an end to the period
of consolidation and a resumption of acceleration. The recession of 1957-58
led to demands for a more active management of the economy than the
Eisenhower administration was prepared to undertake, and these demands
emanated even  from  corporate managers, who  ordinarily harbored a
residual distrust of governmental intervention in the economy. Moreover,
the discovery of poverty and racial segregation as social problems through
the activism of the civil rights movement created an opportunity for the
managerial intelligentsia and the bureaucratic elite of the managerial state
to  design  and  implement social  and  political change and  to  resume the
managerial challenge to the bourgeois order.
In  international affairs,  the  Soviet launching of  Sputnik in  1957
instigated demands  from  all  sectors of  the  elite  to  expand federal and
corporate spending on  defense, education, and  technological research in
aerospace and communications science. Communist seizure of  power in
Cuba, the successful war of liberation in Algeria, and the rise of a similar
movement in Indochina generated fears within the soft elite of the United
States that the hard managerial regime of the Soviet Union would make
strategically irreversible gains in the Third World and that these areas would
be lost to the soft managerial globalism of the West. Much of the foreign
and  defense policy of  the  Kennedy-Johnson era  was  inspired  by  the
opportunity to challenge hard managerial expansionism by the extension of

the soft managerial infrastructure throughout the world.
Aside from the specific events that encouraged the acceleration of the
managerial regime, however, a cultural trend appeared among intellectuals
and publicists that was critical of the complacency, affluence, and lack of
purpose that characterized the period of consolidation. This new trend of the
late  1950s  promoted a  public commitment to  national and  international
“goals” in  place  of  the  apparent  aimlessness of  American culture and
politics of the preceding period. “The critical weakness of our society,”
wrote Walter Lippmann in a column of the late 1950s, “is that for the time
being  our  people do  not  have  great  purposes which they  are  united in
wanting to achieve. The public mood of the country is defensive, to hold on
to and to conserve, not to push forward and to create.”
## [466]
The  cultural drift  that  Lippmann  and  others noted  at  the  end  of  the
decade was due mainly to the atmosphere of the era of consolidation that
had lasted since 1945, but it was due in part also to the moribund condition
of the bourgeois order, which had ceased to be able to sustain its moral,
cultural, and ideological fabric but was still too powerful to permit the rise
of a purely managerial culture in its place. The social and cultural life of the
United States in  the  1950s was  characterized by  the  assimilation of
bourgeois and  non-bourgeois segments of  the  population into  the
organizational framework of  the  managerial regime. This  framework
consisted of  an  economy of  affluence and  mass  consumption of
technologically advanced goods and  services, of  high  vertical and
horizontal mobility, of the “organization man” and his mass workplace in
office and factory and his mass suburban communities, of the formation of
mass audiences by television and other communications technology, and of
mass education for the practical purposes of occupational skill and mobility

with a university degree as its goal. The persistence of bourgeois values and
ideology in the mass society over which the managerial regime presided
and  the  pseudomorphosis of  bourgeois  ideology effected by  consensus
liberalism in  the  1950s  prevented  the  full  development of  a  managerial
culture that would categorically break with the bourgeois order and assert
its  own  vision of  man  and  society.  The  demand for  accelerating the
managerial regime  was  not  only  a  result  of  the  needs, interests, and
aspirations of the elite for expanded power and rewards but also a reflection
of  its  desire to  create a  new  managerial culture that  could  replace the
deracinated and defunct bourgeois order and would contain, rationalize, and
elevate the  new  mass  society spawned by  the  managerial regime while
transforming the  regime into  a  new  and  autonomous managerial
civilization.
The period of acceleration that began in the early 1960s exhibited an
intellectual and cultural atmosphere that encouraged this creative aspiration.
In  many  respects this  atmosphere,  closely associated with  the  Kennedy
administration and  largely  the  product of  a  fairly  small  number of
northeastern urban  intellectuals, academics, and  verbalists in  the  mass
organizations of culture and communication, resembled that of the emergent
phase of the managerial regime. It was an atmosphere characterized by the
themes and  values of  innovation, change, reform, expansion, optimism,
conflict, challenge, adventure, and dynamism, and it contrasted with the
skeptical and risk-aversive consensus liberalism that predominated in the
1950s as the ideology of managerial consolidation. The ethic of acceleration
that prevailed in the 1960s was not only characteristic of the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations and the rhetoric of their leaders but also is evident
in the foundation of the space program, the Peace Corps, and the Special
Forces, the rise of the civil rights movement, the early phase of the mass

“youth culture” of the era, the New Left, and the economic growth and
cultural confidence of the era.
The ethic of acceleration was embodied in a revival of progressivist
ideas,  which, despite their  incompatibility with  much  consensus liberal
thought, had  remained latent  or  muted in  the  1950s and  were  now
resuscitated and grafted on to the framework of consensus liberalism. The
latter  remained the  general ideological rationalization of  the  managerial
regime and functioned as a means of legitimizing its basic structures, but
progressivist ideas were necessary for the acceleration of these structures
toward fulfillment of new managerial goals. The environmentalist premises
of progressivist theory were basic to the attack on racial discrimination and
poverty and the ideas and institutions that sustained them as well as to much
of the foreign policy of the era. Environmentalist social science encouraged
the optimism of the 1960s through the idea that social problems could be
alleviated by the reform of the social conditions that caused them. It thus
revived the scientistic and meliorist or utopian elements of progressivist
thought and supported the belief that the application of managerial skills by
the state to social problems was the principal means of realizing social
amelioration and producing the new civilization of the managerial order. “Is
a new world coming?” asked Lyndon Johnson in his inaugural address in
1965, “We welcome it and we will bend it to the hopes of man.”
The  environmentalist critique of  social institutions also  rejected
particularist loyalties and identities and supported a cosmopolitan ethic that
questioned or discarded racial, class, regional, and national categories and
relationships and asserted a universalist and humanist view of man and
society. Cosmopolitan values and goals were essential to the civil rights
movement, egalitarian policies and  programs, and  the  globalism of

international policies that pursued a transnational integration of the world
through the  development of  managerial infrastructures. Although
managerial liberalism in  the  1960s was  highly critical of  the  “affluent
society,” hedonism, and mass consumption of managerial capitalism, the
basis of much of its criticism was that the persistence of large numbers of
Americans in poverty prevented universal participation in mass affluence. If
liberal John  Kenneth Galbraith  was critical of  the  culture  of  affluence,
liberal Leon Keyserling defended it and the essentially hedonistic ethic that
supports it. Poverty, in Keyserling’s view,
could be reduced in the future mainly as it had been in the past—by large increases in
production for private use and hence in general living standards. . . . Thanks in large
measure to Keyserling, the issue of faster economic growth became a deepening liberal
concern as the decade [the 1950s] neared its end.
## [467]
Even  in  Galbraith’s  critique of  affluence, the  focus  was  on  the
undesirability of private consumption and the desirability of transferring
funds to public works, which would satisfy the material wants of the poor
and assimilate them into the disciplines and ethic of mass hedonism. The
liberal defense of economic growth and mass consumption in the 1960s
thus served to rationalize the hedonistic ethic of managerial capitalism.
The revival of progressivist ideas, the demand for reform and change,
and  the  confident faith  that  managerial skills  and  techniques applied
through government and other mass organizations could ameliorate human
society were  manifestations of  the  ethic  of  acceleration in  the  1960s.
Managerial liberalism in  that  decade did  not  carry  the  implications of
progressivist ideas too far, however. The liberal program
contained no  hint  of  radicalism, no  disposition to  revive the  old  crusade against
consolidated power,  no  desire to  stir  up  class  passions, redistribute the  wealth,  or
restructure existing institutions. . . . The reforms they [liberals] advocated were piecemeal
and implied no basic dissatisfaction with the existing capitalist system. . . . At the end of
the decade [the 1950s] as at the beginning, the intellectuals were holding fast to the vital

center.
## [468]
Liberalism did not endorse a more radical challenge to the “system,” of
course, because it was the principal ideological defense of the system and
because the  system—the soft  managerial regime of  integrated mass
organizations and  their  elite—operated to  implement the  changes that
managerial intellectuals and  other  members of  the  elite  sought. The
managerial intelligentsia that articulated the liberalism of the 1960s was an
organ  of  the  mass  structures of  the  media, whether in educational
institutions or  the  mass communications industry,  and  its  members
participated in and benefited from the managerial state and the managerial
corporations. The acceleration, expansion, and innovation that managerial
liberalism advocated functioned to protect and advance the regime and to
enhance the power, rewards, and status of its elite, including those of the
intellectuals who formulated and espoused it.
The main targets of managerial liberalism were the institutions, ideas,
values, and  social  and  political forces that  resisted acceleration and  lay
beyond the power of the regime in the period of consolidation. The most
significant obstacles to the regime and its agenda were in the American
South, where private institutions and local governments remained bulwarks
of  bourgeois  power and  supported racial  segregation; in  entrepreneurial
sectors of the economy, where the persistence of social and economic class
and hard property generated resistance to managerial power; in electoral
districts where local political bases made congressional opposition to the
managerial state possible; and in local law enforcement and the national
military services, where non-managerial elements retained control of the
instruments of  force.  The  acceleration of  the  regime in  the  1960s was
directed toward  the  eradication of  these  independent power bases  and
centers of  resistance to  managerial power and  to  the  extension of

managerial power over them, and the ethic of acceleration was generally
invoked to  rationalize their  assimilation within the  regime. Once  the
progressivist premises of this ethic were articulated, however, they could
not be applied as selectively as most of the elite wished, and by the later
part  of  the  decade, the  New  Left  was  using  environmentalist ideas  and
progressivist values to challenge managerial liberalism and the regime that
liberalism rationalized.
The  political dimensions of  the  period of  acceleration involved a
massive expansion in the scale and functions of the managerial state and a
resurgence  of  managerial Caesarism. After  the  comparatively lackluster
executive leadership of Truman and Eisenhower in the era of consolidation
and  the  routinization of  charismatic leadership in  the  managerial
bureaucracy, both Kennedy and Johnson adopted a style that presented the
president as  the  leader of  the  nation actively pursuing specific  and  far-
reaching goals and motivating more passive political forces to support these
goals. In the Kennedy administration
The President spoke for the people. Almost alone in the government, it sometimes seemed,
he proposed national solutions for pressing problems. Congressmen and bureaucrats were
too narrow-gauge, tied to special interests. The White House staff, inspired by this truth,
grew larger as presidents searched for the instruments of control.
## [469]
The  portrayal of  executive power  as  independent of  and  superior  to
“special interests”  is  itself  a  characteristic of  Caesarism. The  special
interests that Kennedy sought to overcome or energize included the federal
bureaucracy, which was perceived as having acquired its own interests and
momentum in  the  1950s. Kennedy sought to  animate the  “permanent
government” of the bureaucracy with a “presidential government” of his
own appointees, committed to his own goals and values and loyal to his
person. He  sought control of  the  bureaucracy through political

appointments, close supervision of bureaucratic action, and the creation of
new agencies. Lyndon Johnson held a similar view of presidential power as
the ultimate source of decision in government. “There are many, many, who
can recommend, advise and sometimes a few of them consent,” Johnson
said in 1966, “But there is only one that has been chosen by the American
people to  decide.”
## [470]
Under  his  administration, due  largely  to  his  own
political power and  skills,  presidential and  federal power and  functions
expanded far more than under his predecessor.
The  Caesarist tendencies of  the  Kennedy-Johnson era  were  closely
linked to the environmentalist ideas and their meliorist-utopian implications
that  returned to  life  in  the  1960s.  Utopian imagery was  present in  the
slogans of the “New Frontier,” “Camelot,” and “Great Society,” and the
War  on  Poverty,  originating with  efforts  to  apply  social science and
managerial techniques to  juvenile delinquency,  proceeded  from  the
assumption that crime, poverty, and urban decay were the products of a
social environment that could be ameliorated by the managerial state. David
Hackett and Lloyd Ohlin, who  devised and  implemented the  original
concept of  the  program, saw  themselves as  “revolutionaries .  .  .  on  a
mission to  root  out  the  causes  of  delinquency and  reshape complex
institutions according to the specifications of science.”
## [471]
The revival of managerial Caesarism under Kennedy and Johnson was
not principally directed at the bureaucratic inertia that had developed in the
period of  consolidation, however,  but  at  the  persistent power base  of
bourgeois and anti-managerial forces in local and state government and in
private institutions. The  strong and  explicit support of  the  civil  rights
movement and civil rights legislation by both presidents placed them in
alliance with a new mass political base among American blacks (and other

racial  minorities) and  in  an  adversarial relationship with  the  local  and
private power bases they challenged. The alliance of strong and charismatic
leaders with  a  mass  base  against an  elite  or sub-elite that  controls
intermediary institutions is also a distinctive characteristic of Caesarism,
and the extension of the managerial state into these institutions served to
create a new political coalition for the managerial elite and its agenda. The
Civil  Rights Act  of  1964  enabled  the  federal government to  forbid the
denial of  equal  accommodations by  private facilities and  to  oversee
desegregation of educational institutions under local and state authority as
well as private institutions. It thus challenged the traditional bourgeois idea
and  institution of  property and  local  authority and  promoted their
assimilation within the managerial regime. Desegregation of schools and
other public institutions served to  disseminate cosmopolitan and
environmentalist ideological values throughout the mass culture. The Voting
Rights Act of 1965 enabled the managerial state to determine a significant
portion of the electorate in districts that were generally outside its scope and
thus to weaken the political opposition to the regime that the representatives
of such districts often expressed.
By the 1970s, the Congress, historically the locus of bourgeois political
resistance to the managerial bureaucracy of the executive branch, had itself
become an  institutional bulwark  of  the  managerial regime. The  “Great
Society” programs enacted during the period of acceleration in the 1960s
caused the proliferation of managerial functions and services in the federal
government and considerably enhanced the role of congressional offices in
administering the  disposal of  federal benefits to  their  constituencies.
Congressional offices thus became involved in the managerial functions of
the executive branch itself and acquired a strong interest in perpetuating and
expanding these functions. “The volume of ‘casework’ for constituents and

constituency projects,” wrote  political scientist Samuel G.  Patterson in
## 1978,
has expanded a great deal in the 1970s as the coverage of welfare laws and veterans’
benefits has been enlarged and as federally funded projects in states and communities have
proliferated. . . . A study of Senate staff activity conducted in 1972 showed that two-thirds
of the staff dealt with constituency projects once a day or more, and more than 40 percent
of the Senate aides estimated that they handled casework more than once a day.
## [472]
The dramatic enlargement of congressional staffs—from a total of 1,150
employees for House and Senate combined in 1930 to 5,804 in 1967 and to
11,694 in 1986
## [473]
—enabled congressional offices to manage the increase in
constituent services and also to play a more significant role in overseeing
and  influencing governmental policies and  functions. Congressional
research and  information agencies such  as  the  Congressional Research
Service under the Library of Congress, the General Accounting Office, the
Office  of Technology Assessment, and  the  Congressional Budget Office
facilitated both congressional bureaucratization and the involvement of the
Congress in  administering the  managerial state.  The  proliferation of
congressional staff represented the emergence of a bureaucratic elite in the
legislative branch fused with the managerial state that is analogous to the
emergence of a similar elite in the bureaucracy of the executive branch of
the  state.  Moreover,  demographic  changes in  the  composition of  the
electorate—increasing urbanization and the enfranchisement and intensified
activism of  ethnic and  sexual minorities—as well  as  innovations in  the
techniques of  campaign management served to  remove  bourgeois
representatives from rural and provincial congressional seats, homogenize
and manipulate the mass electorate, and infuse into Congress managerial
elements that were more supportive of such functions of the managerial
state as social and economic regulation, provision of social services, the
enforcement of civil rights laws and policies, and the general use of the

state as an instrument of social manipulation and reconstruction.
Given the assimilation of Congress by the managerial state in the period
of acceleration, the apparent congressional resurgence against presidential
power in  the  1970s  was  less  of  a  renaissance of  an  institution  under
bourgeois control than an effort by congressional managerial forces to resist
the attempts of the Nixon presidency to circumvent what had become an
intermediary entrenchment of the managerial elite. The principal legislation
of the congressional “resurgence”—the Impoundment Control Act of 1974
and  the War  Powers  Resolution  of  1973—sought to  restrict presidential
attempts to control or re-direct congressionally appropriated funds and to
inhibit presidential use  of  military force  abroad. By  preventing the
executive from  controlling the  disposition of  appropriated  funds,
managerial elements in  Congress could  perpetuate the  functions  of  the
managerial state in which they had acquired an interest in preserving. By
limiting the use of force, they could not only gain influence in the direction
of  foreign  and  defense policy but  also  reduce the  role  of  force  in
international policy and  promote  the  role  of  manipulative skills  and
cosmopolitan or globalist values and institutions.
Congressionally enacted legislation on campaign spending in the same
period restricted the  use  of  private funds  for  electoral purposes and
established a  regulatory agency,  the  Federal Election Commission, to
oversee enforcement of  the  legislation. The  new  restrictions  served to
reduce the  role  of  bourgeois  and  entrepreneurial propertied interests in
campaign politics, although the emergence of “political action committees”
to circumvent these laws and mobilize the financial resources of corporate
and labor organizations permitted an enhanced electoral role for managerial
interests, as  well  as  for  those  non-managerial forces that  were  able  to

organize such PACs.
The  managerial assimilation of  Congress during the  period of
acceleration in the 1960s thus represents the tendency of what Max Weber
called “routinization,” by  which the  charismatic qualities of  Caesarist
leadership are  institutionalized into  more  enduring and  regularized or
intermediary structures. In both the Nixon and Reagan presidencies, anti-
managerial forces in the administration sought to penetrate or circumvent
the intermediary structures of the managerial regime—not only Congress
but also the mass organizations of culture and communication—through
their  own  Caesarist-populist tactics. In  neither administration, however,
were anti-managerial elements sufficiently powerful to sustain such efforts,
and  neither Nixon nor  Reagan was  successful in  dismantling or
reconstructing the mass structures of the regime.
## [474]
In addition to diminishing the resistance to the managerial regime in
Congress, the  period of  acceleration in  the  1960s witnessed a  vast
expansion of the scale, costs, personnel, and functions of the managerial
state. The  federal government “busied itself  with  macroeconomic
manipulation of varying degrees of effectiveness, was deeply involved in
transportation, energy, communications, natural resource use,  education,
public health, research, even the arts,” as well as expanding public welfare
programs, and it had begun to consider manpower, population, and land use
issues.
## [475]
While the beginnings of many of these programs were small in
themselves, their authorization often modified by compromise with political
opposition or  “special interests,” and  their  implementation  often
mismanaged by  their  administrators, the  functional enlargement of  the
managerial state  in  the  period of  acceleration served to  popularize and
legitimize the technocratic ideas and goals of the regime and to establish

new structures that sought to realize them.
The effort to accelerate the regime also involved an extension of the
managerial state at the federal level into local and state law enforcement
authorities, jurisdictions that  often remained under anti-managerial
bourgeois control and, as instruments of coercion, represented a significant
aspect of the social struggle for power. The Kennedy administration sought
the  “upgrading and  standardizing [of]  criminal justice throughout the
nation,”
## [476]
and though this effort was not successful during Kennedy’s life,
the Johnson administration supported similar measures with more success.
The President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of
Justice, appointed by Johnson, issued a report in 1967 that found the causes
of crime in poverty and held that “crime flourishes where the conditions of
life are the worst, and that therefore the foundation of a national strategy
against crime is an unremitting national effort for social justice.”
## [477]
## By
portraying crime as a national problem rather than one of the local and state
jurisdictions in which it occurred, by attributing its causes to the social and
economic environment, and by offering a solution in the form of a “national
effort for social justice,” the report offered a justification for the extension
of the managerial state into local and state law enforcement matters.
In general, the Commission found that law enforcement agencies had fallen behind the
times and had failed to make use of new techniques and equipment; and that there was
little employment of systems analysis, data processing, modern scientific analysis and new
training procedures. . . . The Commission “warmly” endorsed federal programs to reduce
delinquency and  crime  and  urged  that  they  be  intensified. It  said  that  “the  Federal
Government can make a dramatic new contribution to the national effort against crime by
greatly expanding its support of the agencies of justice in the states and in the cities.”
## [478]
The extension of the managerial state and the employment of managerial
skills to deal with crime were embodied in the original version of Johnson’s
Safe Streets and Crime Control Act, though congressional action altered its
provisions considerably.  Nevertheless, other  legislative proposals of  the

administration provided federal funds for local and state police agencies,
thereby initiating their assimilation into the managerial apparatus, and for
crime prevention and rehabilitation, and attempted to enact a federal gun
control statute. The federal crime control and law enforcement measures of
this period not only challenged persistent non-managerial power in these
areas  and  extended managerial  power but  also  were  consistent, in  their
encouragement of technically and administratively sophisticated skills in
law enforcement and in their application of social science to crime and its
causes, with  the  Class  I  psychological type  and  behavioral patterns
characteristic of the soft managerial elite.
Decisions of the Supreme Court in the same period, particularly the
Miranda and Escobedo cases, had the effect of establishing homogeneous
national standards of law enforcement to which local and state agencies
were required to conform, as well as of supporting managerial Caesarist
tendencies generally. While the Court was not a direct extension of the
managerial state,  presidential appointment of  its  members on  political
grounds effectively transformed it  into  an  institution that  increasingly
reinforced managerial power and its expansion. By 1965 the Court “had
generally put a judicial seal of approval upon a variety of ‘New Frontier’
programs and objectives, carried on and in some cases implemented further
by President Johnson.”
## [479]
## Chief Justice Warren
had utilized the judiciary as a constructive policy-making instrument in a wide range of
areas.  Intent  more  upon  social  ends  than  upon  legal  subtleties and  refinements,  and
candidly prepared to say so, he had pushed the nation, through his Court’s legal rulings, to
take public actions that Congress was unprepared to recommend and the executive was
incapable, unilaterally, of effectively securing.
## [480]
The revolution in American law, which Warren and the Court during his
tenure did  not  initiate but  carried to  its  furthest extent, was  a  principal
means of transforming the nomocratic government of the bourgeois order

into the teleocratic managerial state, prepared to pursue specific goals and
purposes and using public law as an instrument to achieve them.
The acceleration of the managerial state in domestic affairs paralleled its
acceleration on an international level. Kennedy entered office with explicit
and repeated commitments to enlarge the global role of the United States,
and the ways in which he did so reflected the managerial character of his
globalism. The  most  striking manifestation of  this  character was  the
archetype of  managerial liberalism, Secretary of  Defense Robert
S.  McNamara, the  former president of  Ford  Motors, and,  according to
Robert Kennedy, the man whom President Kennedy regarded as “the most
valuable public servant in the administration and the government.”
## [481]
## The
Secretary instigated and presided over a far-reaching transformation of the
Department of  Defense and  the  military services that  was  intended to
complete their managerialization.
McNamara and his “Whiz Kids” from corporate management confronted the bewildered
generals and admirals with a dazzling and mysterious array of programming, planning and
budgetary techniques that  successfully challenged the  heretofore almost unchallenged
expertise of the career military men. For a few years, these techniques, supported by a
massive use of computers, even offered some hope that the leaders of government would at
last gain control of the enormous and complex apparatus of government. But that hope
petered out late in the Johnson administration, at about the same time as did the hope for
victory in Vietnam which, to so large an extent, had been based on these managerial
miracles.
## [482]
Because of McNamara’s managerial and technical expertise, he exerted
influence outside the Defense Department on other matters such as civil
defense, space policy, intelligence and paramilitary operations, foreign aid,
and foreign policy, and President Johnson, seeing in McNamara’s budgetary
techniques an instrument for presidential control of the federal bureaucracy,
sought to apply them throughout the government.
While resistance to  communist  expansion was  a  main  theme of

Kennedy-Johnson globalism, the  means of  resistance was  through the
export and development of managerial infrastructures in underdeveloped
countries and  the  amelioration of  their  social  problems that  supposedly
encouraged communism. The  utopian and  environmentalist premises of
managerial globalism and the techniques that embodied them were central
in the escalation of American involvement in Vietnam. In February, 1965,
Johnson convened a meeting of military, diplomatic, and technical leaders
in Honolulu to plan the objectives of the coming war effort. “We are here,”
stated the recently elected president, “to talk especially of the works of
peace. We  will  leave  here  determined not  only  to  achieve victory over
aggression but to win victory over hunger, disease, and despair. We are
making a  reality out  of  the  hopes  of  the  common people.” As Frances
FitzGerald explains,
The United States was not going into Vietnam merely for crass power objectives, but for
the salvation of the Vietnamese, who, like the majority of mankind, lived in poverty and
ignorance. The  fight  against Communism  demanded not  only  military power  and
determination, but all the prowess of an advanced industrial society and the generosity of a
nation that led the world in its search for peace, prosperity, and freedom. One section of
the  final  declaration read,  “The  United States  is  pledged to  the  principle of  the  self-
determination of peoples and of government by the consent of the governed. . . . We have
helped and  we  will  help  [the  Vietnamese] to  stabilize the  economy,  to  increase  the
production of goods, to spread the light of education and stamp out disease.”
## [483]
One of the first projects that Johnson proposed to implement his utopian
objectives was  a  “billion-dollar American development project for
Southeast Asia, centering on a vast TVA-like development of the Mekong
## River.”
## [484]
Not only did managerial methods and premises govern the social and
political objectives in Vietnam but also they enveloped the use of military
force. As Colonel Harry Summers has written,
The rationalistic economic approach dominated military strategy formulation throughout
the Vietnam war. . . . The rationalistic system introduced by Secretary McNamara . . . did

an excellent job in “getting control of the lines of supply.” It was and is a useful system for
“preparing for war.” [ . . . ] But while it was efficient in structuring forces in preparation
for war, it was neither designed for, nor was it capable of, fighting the war itself. . . .
British defense  analyst Gregory Palmer  found  that  “the  rationalistic approach is  .  .  .
characterized by the pretension to universality of its solution, its intolerance of tradition
and authority, quantification, simplification, and lack of flexibility. . . . ” The fatal flaw was
that consistency was a premise of rationalistic policy, and the one thing war is not is
consistent.
## [485]
The  application of  managerial  military and social engineering
techniques to Vietnam was only the most visible illustration of the activist
managerial globalism of  the  era.  Kennedy’s  Alliance for  Progress,
motivated largely by fear of communism in Latin America after the victory
of Castro, proceeded from similar assumptions, as did the “United Nations
Development Decade,” the “Food for Peace” program, and the Peace Corps.
The goal of all these policies and programs was “to transform the 1960s
into a historic decade of democratic progress,” as Kennedy described the
Alliance. Since “democratic progress” was  to  be  achieved  by  the
development of  managerial infrastructures in  Third  World  governments,
economies, and  social institutions and  of  managerial elites in
underdeveloped states  that  would be  interdependent with  the  emerging
global managerial elite  centered  in  the  advanced states, these  policies
amounted essentially to a systematic effort to integrate the non-communist
world within the global framework of the soft managerial regime.
Outside the  sector of  the  state,  but  closely linked with  it,  other
managerial structures also expanded in size, functions, and power in the
1960s. The mass organizations of culture and communication became the
dominant institutions in the transmission of ideas, information, and values.
In the decade between 1954-55 and 1964-65, the number of state colleges
and universities with enrollments of over 10,000 increased from 18 to 59,
comprising over 55 per cent of such institutions. By 1967, institutions of
higher learning included more than 7 million students, of whom nearly a

million were  pursuing advanced degrees, and  some  500,000 faculty
members.
## [486]
Two students of the educational system found that “the large
campus has become the dominant environment in public higher education
today,”  that  “managerial innovation is  a  much more pronounced
characteristic of large campuses than it is of small ones,” and that federal
aid  to  universities effectively  encouraged the  managerialization and
bureaucratization of  higher education.
## [487]
The  expansion  of  universities,
however,  was  only  one  aspect of  the  general enlargement of  the  mass
organizations of  culture and  communication, including the  corporate
communications industry and tax-exempt or public research institutions.
## [488]
The  inhabitants, beneficiaries, and  directors of  the  mass  cultural
organizations were primarily the managerial intelligentsia, who enhanced
their  incomes, power,  and  status  as  mass communications, education,
research, and information expanded. In the 1960s a new professional and
social stratum emerged in American culture that was closely related to the
managerial intelligentsia and to other components of the managerial elite
and contained both the “producers and consumers of the products of the
media.”
These people were members of minorities (especially Jews) raised in metropolitan areas,
who had received college educations, were liberal-cosmopolitan in orientation, and had
chosen the  professions rather  than  traditional  business careers. .  .  .  The  new  metro-
Americans were still a relatively small portion of the population of the 1960s; the total
number of  technical and  professional employees (occupations requiring at  least  some
college education) had grown from about 3.8 million in 1941 to over 8.5 million in 1964.
Nonetheless, their values and attitudes were beginning to have an impact on newspapers,
magazines, and even television. For one thing, their numbers were now large enough to
provide an audience for more sophisticated films and periodicals, as well as for journals
that took a less parochial and narrowly patriotic view of American institutions.
## [489]
The  professional intellectual and  verbalist groups in  the  1960s
discovered a  hero  in  John  F.  Kennedy,  whose Harvard education and
reputation for  intellectualism contributed to  his  personality cult,  and

intellectuals either directly participated in government in his administration
or benefited from it through increased governmental aid to education and
research or through the high value that the Kennedy administration placed
on intellectuals and the patronage it gave them. The creation in the 1960s of
the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment
for the Arts served to fuse the managerial intelligentsia more firmly with the
managerial state.  The  intelligentsia provided the  managerial state  with
ideological rationalizations through adherence to  and  articulation of
managerial liberalism. Not until the Vietnam war controversy and the New
Left of the later 1960s did the intellectual and verbalist groups begin to
question and then challenge openly the dominant ideology, structures, and
dynamic of the managerial regime.
In addition to mass universities closely connected to the managerial state
and publicly funded endowments for the intellectual, scientific, and artistic
professions, tax-exempt foundations and  “think tanks” also  emerged  as
powerful cultural and  intellectual forces integrated with  the  managerial
elite. In the Depression and afterwards, “college administrators, academics,
foundation managers, and  civil  servants began to  form  a  growing
managerial network. The  reorganization of  the  foundation world’s
infrastructure paralleled that of large industry as ownership became further
separated from management.” The effective control of foundation financial
resources by managerial elites meant that these resources could be used for
supporting the design and management of social change in conformity with
the interests and values of the elite.
Instead of simply ameliorating distressing social conditions, foundations channeled efforts
to correct them through planned social reforms. These led initially to foundation-sponsored
social science research and thus ultimately to foundation involvement in the public policy
process. Up-to-date foundations believed  in  developing pilot  programs to  serve  as
prototypes for  much  larger  government-funded programs. The  shift  in  purpose led
foundations to urge the government to assume the burden of developing massive programs

for social change.
## [490]
The  acceleration  of  the  regime was  less  popular with  corporate
managers, who  retained a  distrust of  the  Democratic Party  and  of
governmental regulation of the economy. Nevertheless, Kennedy himself
spent an inordinate amount of time courting corporate managers, trying to
bring  them  into  his  coalition, and  supporting policies in  their  interests.
Despite the skepticism of corporate leaders, major corporations participated
in the War on Poverty by administering urban training centers for the Job
## Corps.
## [491]
In  soliciting corporate support, Kennedy generally avoided
progressivist themes and emphasized the pragmatic goals and methods of
his administration. He and his advisers worked closely with the Business
Council, and Lyndon Johnson hosted a meeting with 89 members of the
Business Council at the White House twelve days after Kennedy’s death.
## [492]
Most of the managerial elite in the corporations supported Johnson over
Goldwater in 1964, and several of the more prominent corporate leaders
supported Humphrey over Nixon in 1968.
## [493]
Managerial corporations also expanded during the 1960s. By 1971 the
process of corporate concentration that began in the 1940s had resulted in
the 100 largest manufacturing corporations owning over 49 per cent of the
assets of all such firms, more than the top 200 corporations had held in
## 1948.
[T]he pace of this centralizing activity grew all through the 1960s. Between 1963 and
1966,  the  value  of  assets  acquired by  the  big  mining and  manufacturing companies
averaged $4 billion to $5 billion a year. This rate rose to $10 billion in 1967, then to $15
billion in 1968, and reached an all-time peak rate of $20 billion in the first quarter of 1969,
before the break in the stock-market brought mergers to an abrupt halt.
## [494]
The  process of  concentration was  of  little  concern to  the  Kennedy
administration, which did not enforce anti-trust legislation vigorously and
in  some  specific cases  encouraged  or  subsidized monopolies  of  large

corporations. Moreover,  the  close  cooperation between government and
corporations in the 1960s promoted further the fusion of state and economy
and the unification of the managerial elites of both sectors.
The two-way exchange of senior personnel between government and business has vastly
improved communication  between the  two  sectors and  implicitly reflects a  new
appreciation of the commonness of the problems confronting executives in managing big
organizations, whether  they  happen to  bear  a  “public” or  “private” label.  This  new
interdependence is still in a formative state, but it was encouraged to such a degree by
Lyndon B.   Johnson and accepted so heartily by so many businessmen that it appears
almost certain to be a permanent feature of the American way for years to come.
## [495]
The  fusion also  served to  promote the  cooperation of  corporate
managers with government in managed social change through the resolution
of  “problems like  job  training,  civil  rights, lower  income housing, city
rejuvenation, education, and  water  pollution,” and  in  developing what
George Champion of the Chase Manhattan Bank called in 1967 “an exciting
and challenging new concept of the relationship between the public and
private sectors of the American economy.”
## [496]
Corporate participation in
public programs for social reform and engineering illustrates the support of
the managerial elite in the corporations for continuing social change and the
expansionist dynamic of the soft managerial regime. Nor did the Kennedy
era  display any  sympathy for  declining entrepreneurial capitalism.
Kennedy’s  “economic policy in  general reflected the  almost total
abandonment of  the  entrepreneur by  the  liberal and  corporate
establishments,” writes Don Gevirtz. “Dismissing the old concerns about
corporate concentration, Kennedy saw economics as consisting essentially
of  ‘technical  problems,’  solvable  only  by  the  close  cooperation of  both
corporate and governmental experts.”
## [497]
The political leaders, corporate executives, intellectuals, and verbalists
who presided over and assisted the acceleration of the managerial regime in
the 1960s did so not primarily because the expansion of mass organizations

and managerial control was in their material self-interest as a social and
political force, but  because their  ideological preconceptions and
assumptions, not  always on  a  conscious level,  led  them  to  perceive
problems and solutions and to frame questions and answers in a perspective
that  rationalized  the  acceleration. The  ideology of  the  soft  managerial
regime and the deeply-rooted perspective it generated were consistent with
the basic psychological type and the patterns of behavior that predominated
in the elite. No doubt there were members of the elite who considered or
advocated actions that were not consistent with this perspective and the
psychological type  associated with  it,  and  occasionally their  dissent
prevailed. But  the  ideology evolved, long  before as  well  as  during the
period of acceleration, in accordance with the interests of the elite and the
structures and methods on which its power was based. Deviation from these
interests could not prevail for long or become a general pattern because it
would have created dysfunctions in the apparatus of the elite, weakened or
destabilized its dominance, and eventually led to its decline or replacement
by alternative groups. The ideology of the regime, identifying in a coded
form the interests of the elite for its members, was an adaptation to these
interests. It  was  sufficiently vague in  its  philosophical and  scientific
underpinnings to  be  flexible under  differing circumstances and  to  be
appealing to  a  wide  range  of  the  population, and  it  was  sufficiently
successful through its  codes  in  both  disguising and  communicating the
interests of the elite and the kind of behavior that was consistent with them
to provide a usually reliable guide to action.
By the late 1960s, however, the pace of the managerial regime began to
decelerate. The deceleration was due not only to the periodic need of the
regime to consolidate and assimilate new power and resources acquired in a
preceding period of acceleration but also to the emergence of social and

political forces that challenged both the ideological defenses and the basic
apparatus of  power of  the  regime.  These challenges were  not  merely
accidental but were deeply related to the structures and dynamics of the soft
managerial regime, and the power that they acquired in the late 1960s and
1970s forced it into a protracted crisis and a further period of consolidation.
In the era that began approximately with the national election of 1968,
the principal problem for the managerial elite and its regime was to counter
the  challenges mounted by  the  New  Left  and  the  New  Right  and  to
assimilate the social forces behind them into its framework of political,
economic, and cultural power. The resolution of this problem was difficult
and has not yet been fully achieved, because the challenges were the most
serious encountered by  the  regime, because its  internal vulnerabilities
retarded the  effort  to  assimilate the  challenges, and  because in  some
respects the  forces behind the  challenges cannot be  assimilated and  are
incompatible with soft managerialism. The protracted crisis of the regime
caused by the emergence of anti-managerial forces jeopardizes not only the
functioning of the regime of mass organizations but also the basic interests
of  its  elite  and  thereby its  very  survival, and  it  also  endangers the
emergence and efflorescence of a new managerial civilization in which a
soft managerial elite would predominate.

## The New Left Challenge
The New Left of the 1960s originated within the managerial elite itself,
and  more  especially among its  younger members within the  academic
institutions of the mass cultural and communications organizations. Except
for political alliances with black nationalist movements, which often broke
down over differences in political objectives, the adherents of the New Left
never extended beyond the managerial elite, and their activities flourished
almost exclusively within the sectors and regions of the mass society that
were most closely linked with and controlled by the managerial regime—
the mass universities and urban conglomerates of the northeastern United
States and the similar region on the West Coast.
The principal reason for the emergence of a section of the managerial
elite in the New Left as an anti-managerial political movement lay in what
Stanley Rothman and S.  Robert Lichter call the “erosion of the American
social myth” that occurred in the post-World War II era and particularly in
the late 1950s. What Rothman and Lichter mean by the “American social
myth” is mainly the cultural and ideological formula of the equilibrium
between managerial and bourgeois forces that developed in the period of
consolidation as  “consensus liberalism.” While this  equilibrium and  its
rationalization served the function of perpetuating the managerial regime
and reconciling the bourgeois sub-elite to acceptance of it, the dynamics of
the  managerial regime—its propensity for  continuing enlargement,
expansion, and innovation—rendered a permanent equilibrium impossible
and eroded its ideological consensus. The managerial elite, because of its
group  interests and  its  disaffiliation from  bourgeois  and  pre-managerial

institutions, seeks an acceleration of the regime it controls and a renewed
challenge to  bourgeois  institutions that  constrain its  acceleration. The
erosion of the consensus was thus not contrary to but consistent with the
basic interests of the elite and the regime it dominated.
In its origins, the New Left was part of the demand for the acceleration
of  the  managerial regime and  the  abandonment of  consolidation that
developed within the elite in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The rejection
of the consensus ideology or “American social myth,” write Rothman and
## Lichter,
was most pronounced among professional people in the service sector of society, which
was  rapidly  growing.  The  new  critics were  concentrated in  areas  associated with  the
creation and dissemination of knowledge, especially the universities and the media. The
influence of this segment of the population was growing even as its members became more
liberal and  cosmopolitan.  For  one  thing,  more  and  more Americans were  enrolled in
colleges and  universities .  .  .  For  another,  with  the  advent of  television and  rapid
technological advances in  transportation, Americans and  the  rest  of  the  world were
becoming ever smaller. Indeed, the events and cultural styles of New York and Washington
spread to  “backwater” small  communities  with  a  rapidity which would have  been
inconceivable even twenty-five years earlier.
## [498]
Those members of the elite who were most skeptical and hostile toward
the compromise with bourgeois forces and who demanded a rejection of the
compromise and its ideological formulation were also those who were most
intensely subjected to the cosmopolitan and homogenizing influences of the
expanding mass media. They included the younger generation of the elite,
formed in  the  mass  educational institutions and  by  the  new  medium of
television, as well as the intellectual and verbalist professions generally,
which derived their income, power, and status from the mass organizations
of  culture  and  communication  and  the  expansion of  their  scale  and
influence; and it was largely from these sectors of the managerial elite that
the New Left and its sympathizers emerged.

The New Left was thus not originally an anti-managerial force but was
supportive of  the  regime and  its  acceleration toward the  fulfillment of
managerial goals. It became anti-managerial because the regime could not
immediately accommodate its  aspirations for  acceleration and  the
fulfillment of  these  goals  to  the  extent it  demanded, and  the  resulting
frustration rather quickly produced a rejection of the regime as fraudulent
and  repressive. “Among the  sources of  sixties radicalism,” writes Allen
## J. Matusow,
none was more important than disillusionment with liberalism. A generation reared to
believe in America as the land of the free and the home of the brave was forced by events
to confront the facts of American racism, poverty, and imperialism. The same liberals who
promised to abolish these evils, new leftists came to believe, played politics with race,
fought a phony poverty war, and napalmed Vietnamese. Beneficiaries of a system that
seemed to do evil, guilt-ridden students committed themselves to liberate those whom
America oppressed.
## [499]
The  managerial regime, however,  was  incapable of  fulfilling the
professed goals of its own ideology. Aside from the problem of whether
these  utopian and  cosmopolitan goals  are  attainable, the  persistence of
bourgeois  power as  an  obstacle to  managerial acceleration forced the
regime to  compromise with  and  accommodate non-managerial demands
even during the period of its acceleration. Moreover, many of the members
of the managerial elite, despite their commitment to their ideology and their
interest in accelerating the regime, retained considerable loyalty to various
bourgeois values and ideas and found it difficult to accept the unadulterated
implications of acceleration and the resurgence of progressivist ideology.
Finally,  and  perhaps most  significantly,  the  managerial elite  sought to
implement its goals through the mechanisms of mass organizations and the
managerial skills  and  functions that  controlled them, and  while the
tendencies of mass organizations worked against the bourgeois order and its
remnants and toward the implementation of managerial goals, the actual

and more immediate result (and, to a large extent, the purpose) of these
tendencies was to enhance the power and rewards of the managerial elite
and not to fulfill literally the professed goals of its ideology. In so far as the
elite perceived that more radical efforts to fulfill its professed goals would
interfere with  the  pursuit of  its  own  interests, the  fulfillment  of  the
professed goals was compromised and attenuated.
The frustration experienced and perceived by the New Left in the early
1960s in efforts to alleviate poverty and promote the civil rights movement
led to an eventual repudiation of the managerial regime as a whole. Yet
despite the rejection of the regime by New Left adherents, their ideology
and activities in the 1960s in several ways were not contrary to managerial
interests and in fact often assisted managerial acceleration and the challenge
to  bourgeois  and  non-managerial forces. This  assistance was  largely
inadvertent and arose from a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of
the  managerial  regime and  its  dynamic by  the  New  Left.  The
misunderstanding of the regime permeated New Left ideology. It consisted
in the erroneous idea that the managerial regime was in fact an extension
and a continuation of the bourgeois order, that its ruling class was bourgeois
capitalist, and that it sustained itself in power by the same means as non-
managerial elites of the past. The principal political concerns of the New
Left  reflected this  erroneous conception of  the  managerial regime. Its
opposition to racism, to nationalism and imperialism and the Vietnam war,
to the use of force on an international or domestic level as a means of
repression, and to capitalism and the “middle class values” that sustained it
show that the New Left misperceived the soft managerial regime as a hard
regime that relied on particularist, solidarist, and ascetic ideologies and the
use of force to support itself and was dominated by an essentially bourgeois
elite.

To a large extent, this misunderstanding derived from the rather callow
Marxism that  many New  Leftists embraced and  from  New  Left
regurgitation of the Marxist critique of 19th-century bourgeois capitalism.
Whatever the applicability of Marxist perspectives to capitalism and the
state in the 19th century, their reference to their 20th-century analogues is
only tangential. The dematerialization of property, the revolution of mass
and scale, the dominance of managerial and technocratic functions and of
those  groups that  perform such  functions, and  the  reliance of  the  soft
managerial elite on manipulative styles of power and systems of belief had
by  the  early  20th  century superseded bourgeois  capitalism  and  the
bourgeois  state  and  had  superannuated the  bourgeois  elite.  But  the
misunderstanding of  the  New  Left  was  also  reinforced by  the  very
considerable influence of C.  Wright Mills, who seems to have coined the
term “New Left,” who was “the intellectual who most influenced the early
new left,” and who heavily influenced the “Port Huron Statement” of the
Students for a Democratic Society.
## [500]
In Mills’s theory of the “power elite,”
managerial elements remain the subordinate or assimilated employees of a
dominant “propertied class,” and “The recent social history of American
capitalism does not reveal any distinct break in the continuity of the higher
capitalist class.”
## [501]
Aside from necessary adaptations to larger scale and
more technical operations, the “propertied class,” in Mills’s view, retained
its dominance through ownership of property and through the economic,
social, and  political power that  ownership yields, and  this  elite  was
essentially conservative in  its  social  values and  policies. Mills  did  not
perceive that  the  managerial elements were  in  conflict with  and  were
becoming dominant over the bourgeois forces and that their group interests
conflicted with those of the old bourgeois order.
The practical effect on the New Left of the influence of this erroneous

understanding of the managerial regime was to misdirect its critique of the
regime away from the distinctively managerial elements that predominated
within it and toward the persistent but subordinate bourgeois elements of
the regime. The New Left rejected the political, economic, and cultural
compromises of the managerial regime with bourgeois remnants that had
developed in  the  period of  consolidation and  could  not  be  immediately
overcome without destabilizing the  regime itself, and  it  rejected the
pseudomorphosis of bourgeois ideology in consensus liberalism, by which
the  regime  sought to  portray itself  as  the  fulfillment, with  historically
necessary adaptations, of  the  bourgeois  order,  and  with  which the  elite
sought to placate and assimilate bourgeois elements.
In rejecting the bourgeois elements in the managerial regime, however,
the New Left mistakenly took such elements as the whole or dominant part
of  the  regime and  thus  missed the  essential distinctions between the
bourgeois and managerial orders. The rejection of “technocracy” and of
mass organizations in general by the New Left was predicated on the belief
that  they  were  the  manifestations  of  bourgeois  interests rather  than  the
logical culmination of anti-bourgeois managerial interests and ideology, and
in  demanding the  repudiation  of  bourgeois  power,  ideas, values, and
institutions, the  New  Left  actually  assisted the  process of  managerial
acceleration by challenging and opposing the major obstacle to managerial
goals. The regime itself was eventually able to assimilate and make use of
the anti-bourgeois thrust of the New Left, though it largely filtered out and
ignored the New Left rejection of “technocracy.”
The misunderstanding of the managerial regime by the New Left also
contributed to its erroneous idea of the role of force in the domestic and
international policies of the managerial state, and specifically the use of the

instruments of force in Vietnam and against domestic dissidents. The New
Left’s view of what its proponents variously called the “warfare state,” the
“garrison state,” or the “national security state” was based on the idea that
the managerial regime relies on coercion, as traditional elites and regimes
often do, as a means of sustaining itself in power. In fact, the state of the
soft managerial regime cannot rely on coercion to any great extent (which is
why it did not simply repress the New Left) because the psychological type,
behavioral patterns, interests, and ideology of the soft managerial elite are
inconsistent with  reliance on  force  and  depend upon  manipulation in
politics, the economy, and the culture. During the period of acceleration, the
managerial regime in the United States sought to extend its control of the
instruments of  force  at  the  national and  local  levels through Robert
McNamara’s innovations in the Defense Department and through similar
reforms encouraged  by  the  federal government in  local  and  state  law
enforcement (although it was not entirely successful in the latter effort), and
the  attempt to  extend managerial  control over  the  instruments of  force
involved a dramatic modification of the use of coercion and the way in
which coercion is applied.
The incompatibility of reliance on force with the mentality, beliefs, and
interests of the soft managerial elite accounts for its incompetence in using
coercion and  its  reluctance to  employ force  in  general and  for  the
incompetence of its use of force in Vietnam specifically and even in the
assassination plots  of  the  CIA  in  this  period. In  the  latter,  no  one  was
actually assassinated except the Diem brothers in Vietnam, who were slain
by South Vietnamese military officers and not by the CIA or the American
government, which neither desired nor  ordered their  execution.
Domestically, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the most notable instances
of the use of force against dissidents, rioters, or criminals occurred in local

jurisdictions and were carried out by agencies that were generally outside
managerial control—by Southern sheriffs  and  state  police against civil
rights demonstrators, by the Chicago police against New Left dissidents at
the  national convention of  the  Democratic Party  in  1968,  by  national
guardsmen and prison guards under state authority at Kent State and Attica
in 1971, by the Los Angeles Police Department against the Symbionese
Liberation Army  in  1974,  and  by  national guardsmen and  local  police
against most urban rioters in general. It was in part the apparent brutality
and immediacy of the use of force by such bourgeois, post-bourgeois, or
non-managerial elements and authorities that instigated the attempts of the
managerial regime at  the  national level  to  extend its  control of  the
instruments of force in the 1960s.
The New Left also displayed its misunderstanding of the managerial
regime in its critique of the Vietnam war and of American “imperialism.”
Drawing its  interpretation of  imperialism from  Lenin and  from  later
revisions of  Lenin’s  theory of  imperialism, the  New  Left  failed to
distinguish the motivations of managerial globalism from those of finance
capitalism as well as from classic imperialism. Managerial globalism is not
imperialism in  the  traditional sense  of  the  expansion of  a  nation or  a
political-cultural entity over new territory, nor is it motivated primarily by
the need for profits from foreign markets that in Lenin’s theory is the cause
of capitalist imperialism. Managerial globalism is the result of the need and
the ability of the managerial elite (in the state and the mass culture as well
as  in  the  economy)  to  extend and  enhance its  power by  developing
managerial infrastructures in non-managerial societies. By integrating such
infrastructures into  a  transnational order,  it  actually contributes  to  the
erosion of  national, racial, and  cultural particularisms and  to  their
replacement by  a  global cosmopolitan identity within the  framework of

mass organizations under the direction of a transnational managerial elite.
The  unit  of  expansion is  thus  not  the  nation or  culture, as  in  historic
imperialism, but the managerial elite itself, and the transnational apparatus
of the elite tends to become a new and autonomous identity. As in the
extension of the managerial regime within a particular society, managerial
globalism does  not  depend on  force  or  profit  motives deriving  from
ownership of  hard  property but  on  the  continuous enlargement of  mass
organizations, on  the  application of  managerial skills  and  functions to
economic, political, social, and  cultural relations, and  on  manipulative
modes of control that are associated with such applications. The use of
force to protect or extend managerial global projects usually represents a
failure of the implementation of its extension, as it did in Vietnam, and is
usually executed with a minimum of competence and with the brutality that
accompanies incompetence.
Like  its  critique of  the  managerial regime as  a  continuation of  the
bourgeois order, the New Left critique of American foreign policy mistook
peripheral bourgeois and non-managerial elements as the core of American
foreign policy. By concentrating its criticism on such elements, the New
Left served to reduce their influence as a brake on the global acceleration of
the regime and thereby to assist the process of acceleration. While the New
Left eventually exerted a historic influence on the conduct of the Vietnam
war, the use of force in international policy, and the adoption of restrictions
on governmental and corporate policies and activities abroad, these reforms
did not seriously challenge the framework of managerial globalism. In the
late 1970s and through the 1980s, the development of “human rights” as a
theme of  American foreign policy,  coupled with  the  rise  of  a  “global
economy” and  with  U.S.  efforts  to  develop “global democracy” and  a
foreign policy centering on “transnational issues” such as environmental,

legal, economic, strategic, and cultural problems, enabled the managerial
regime to  continue its  global  extension through the  modernization of
political and economic infrastructures in undeveloped states and thereby to
encourage the emergence and interdependence of soft managerial elites in
such states. Although the use of force continued sporadically, neither force
nor corporate investment in the traditional sense was essential to the main
line of managerial global integration.
The New Left’s misconceptions of the nature of the managerial regime
thus actually assisted the regime in its acceleration by contributing to the
rejection of bourgeois elements and the revision of consensus ideology; and
the New Left did little to jeopardize the acceleration. Other aspects of New
Left ideology in many respects actually resembled managerial liberalism in
the 1960s. Aside from its misunderstanding of the managerial regime and
its rejection of technocracy, mass organizations, and managerialism, New
Left ideology incorporated most of the progressivist premises and values of
managerial liberalism that  re-emerged  in  the  Kennedy-Johnson era. The
New Left found in Marxism and its revisionist variations a new and more
radical vehicle for the environmentalist presuppositions of progressivist and
liberal theory, and it also revived and pushed to an extreme the progressivist
interpretation of  environmentalism as  a  basis  for  utopianism and
cosmopolitanism. In  this  respect, it  differed  from  managerial liberalism
only in viewing the managerial regime itself as part of the bourgeois enemy,
thus turning the relativist and environmentalist weapon against those whom
it  originally  served, and  in  pushing the  radical implications of  this
ideological weapon much further than the regime found it convenient or
possible to go.
The New Left viewed the ideas, values, tastes, manners, and morals of

bourgeois society as impositions that served the interests of a dominant
capitalist ruling class, and it demanded an immediate fulfillment of utopian
goals by the dismantlement of the managerial regime and its replacement by
“participatory democracy,”  “counter-communities,” and  alternative
institutions that would embody cosmopolitan and utopian principles and in
which the bourgeois particularist identities of class, nationality, ethnicity,
and  sexuality would be  abolished  and  transcended by  a  cosmopolitan
identity.  The  environmentalist premises of  New  Left  ideology also
supported an explicit defense of hedonism, especially among the counter-
cultural movements, that was based on the rejection of conventional moral
values as repressive and relative. Nor did the New Left and the counter-
culture, for  all  their  repudiation  of  technocracy and  their  indulgence of
irrationalism, entirely reject the scientism of  progressivist ideology.
Marxism itself claimed a scientific basis and rationalized the application of
science to society, and much of the New Left critique of the managerial
regime and  bourgeois  persistence also  claimed a  foundation in  social
science. Counter-cultural “Dionysianism,” developed in  the  Marxian
Freudianism of Herbert Marcuse and Norman O.  Brown, often degenerated
into  a  nihilistic  denial of  order  in  external reality,  but  at  its  more
sophisticated levels sought in contemporary science (especially cosmology
and  psychology)  an  affirmation of  the  mystical worldview  it  tried  to
articulate. The defense of the use of drugs by the counter-culture generally
involved an  appeal to  science, as  did  the  ecology movement  and  the
liberation movements for women, racial groups, and homosexuals. A cliché
of the era reveals the persistence of scientistic and technocratic categories in
the mentality of the New Left and the counter-culture, that if the United
States could place a man on the moon, it ought to be able to abolish poverty,
war, hunger, and racism. The assumption of the popular slogan is that the

economic, political, psychological, and moral problems of human society
are analogous to the purely scientific and technical problems of engineering
and astronautics, an assumption that is a characteristic feature of managerial
scientism.
The principal difference between the ideology of managerial liberalism
and  that  of  the  New  Left  was  the  rejection by  the  New  Left  of  mass
organizations and  managerialism.  Managerial liberalism defended  mass
organizations and the managerial and technical skills that controlled them as
the  practical, scientifically valid, and  rationalistically designed and
administered mechanisms for  the  realization of  progressivist values and
objectives. The rejection of managerialism by the New Left was clearly
contrary to  the  interests of  the  managerial elite,  yet  militant New  Left
utopianism and cosmopolitanism presented no serious threat to the elite or
the regime it dominated. The alternative institutions that the New Left and
the counter-culture advocated were based on a naive utopianism that was
far too exotic to exert wide appeal and was too simple to present a serious
alternative to  mass  organizations  and  their  disciplines. New  Left  and
counter-cultural alternatives flourished in the late 1960s only because they
continued to  depend on  managerial infrastructures and  bourgeois
institutions. They  indirectly made  use  of  the  products of  managerial
capitalism and  relied  on  protection from  the  managerial state,  and  they
depended directly on the social and cultural disciplines and the conceptual
and  practical  skills  inculcated in  their  adherents by  the  managerial
educational and  cultural organizations. The  utopian communities and
movements of the 1960s were incapable of generating their own discipline
or of sustaining themselves independently of the society they rejected, and
most of them eventually collapsed or degenerated under the burdens of the
crime, drugs,  and  deviance that  they  regarded as  liberating and  were

incapable of controlling.
Yet  while  New  Left  and  counter-cultural primitivism did  little  to
threaten or  challenge the  managerial regime, it  did  contribute to  the
criticism of bourgeois values and the power of bourgeois forces, and this
aspect of  New  Left  ideology was  promoted and  disseminated by  the
managerial media, which sought to  challenge bourgeois  obstacles to
managerial acceleration. The exotic utopianism of the New Left and the
counter-culture was not therefore a threat to the managerial regime, and it
assisted the  regime in  its  own  challenge to  bourgeois  ideology and
institutions.
Thus, although the New Left repudiated the managerial regime and its
ideological defenses, several characteristics of the New Left prevented it
from becoming as serious a challenge to the regime as most of its adherents
and many of its critics believed it was. Its misunderstanding of the regime,
its hostility to the bourgeois forces that also were enemies of the managerial
elite, its support for basic progressivist ideas and values that were consistent
with managerial ideology and interests, and the general irrelevance of many
of  its  exotic activities and  beliefs often  assisted the  acceleration of  the
regime. Such  characteristics prevented the  New  Left  from  evolving a
serious and  enduring anti-managerial ideology and  consciousness, from
creating practical alternatives to managerial structures, and from developing
a mass base outside the elite, and in large part these characteristics reflected
the origins of the New Left in the managerial elite itself.
The  New  Left  presented more  of  a  challenge, however,  through the
persistence, intensity,  and  militancy of  its  ideology and  activism and
through the political and cultural influence that it was able to gain. By
developing and articulating the progressivist elements that it shared with

managerial liberalism, the New Left was able to challenge the credibility of
managerial ideology and thus to threaten the formulas by which the regime
legitimized itself.  The  New  Left’s  general argument against managerial
liberalism as it had developed by the 1960s was that liberal claims were
fraudulent and  a  mask  for  self-interest, and  although its  critique of
liberalism was erroneous in seeing it as a defense of bourgeois capitalism,
the “corporate liberalism” that New Left theorists such as Carl Oglesby and
James Weinstein dissected was sufficiently similar to managerial ideology
to wound it seriously and come close to discrediting it. The response that
the  managerial elite  was  forced to  issue  to  the  New  Left  attack  on  its
formula of legitimacy was to reformulate its ideological defenses in such a
way as to satisfy the aspirations and demands of the most radical members
of the elite in the New Left and at the same time to re-legitimize the mass
organizations of the regime and their managerial control.
The New Left’s challenge to the ideological defenses of the regime was
never a serious threat to the regime and its elite, however, and in many
ways  the  challenge to  consensus liberalism was  compatible with  the
tendency to  acceleration that  prevailed in  the  1960s. The  regime  easily
deflected and assimilated the New Left challenge and did so with minimal
modification of its own functions and structures. The means by which the
regime responded  to  the  New  Left  was  a  classic illustration  of  the
manipulative style of dominance on which the soft managerial elite relies.
The process of assimilation was successful because most of the adherents of
the New Left movement were drawn from the managerial class, exhibited
the same psychological type and patterns of behavior that distinguish the
elite of soft managerialism, and had been formed in the intellectual and
verbal categories of  the  elite  in  the  mass  organizations of  culture and
communication of the regime.

Since the premises and values of the ideological formulas of the regime
resembled those of the New Left, the adaptation of managerial liberalism to
express New Left ideas and goals was not difficult. Since many of the
demands of  the  New  Left  overlapped with  managerial interests and
ideology,  the  regime could  make  concessions that  allowed New  Left
adherents to participate in the managerial political system and incorporated
some  reforms that  they  demanded—increased political attention to  the
minority groups that the New Left championed; restrictions on military,
police, and intelligence agencies and on the international commitments and
policies of the managerial state; and modification of the “national security
state”  through  the  abolition of  conscription and  the  expansion of  civil
liberties and cultural “openness.” Such reforms and modifications tended to
placate the mainstream of the adherents of the New Left and afforded them
the  opportunity to  advance within and  to  exert  influence upon  the
managerial regime, to “work within the system to change the system,” in a
phrase current in  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s, when  the  process of
assimilation was occurring. The presidential campaign of Senator George
McGovern in  1972  drew  many New  Leftists into  the  political and
communicational structures of the regime. The Watergate scandal appeared
to  legitimize  some  of  the  New  Left  complaints of  the  fraudulence,
repressiveness, and  corruption of  the  regime. The  ensuing reforms and
restrictions on  the  intelligence  and  law  enforcement functions and  the
foreign and military policies of the managerial state reflected the influence
of the New Left, but these adaptations also represented the resistance of
managerial elements in Congress and the bureaucracy to anti-managerial
tendencies in the Nixon administration. In the administration of President
Carter, a number of former New Leftists actually obtained fairly prominent
and  influential positions, and  the  “institutionalization of  more  radical

attitudes on  college campuses  was  facilitated by  an  influx  of  radical
academics into  social  science and  humanities departments all  over  the
country.”
## [502]
The counter-culture itself also was assimilated into the framework of the
regime. Both the cosmopolitanism and the hedonism of the counter-culture
served the managerial imperatives of the homogenization and disciplining
of mass society by the mass organizations of culture and communication
and the hedonistic ethic of managerial capitalism. The adherents of both the
New  Left  and  the  counterculture represented a  vast  market of  young
consumers, whose affluence, leisure, and sophisticated and unconventional
tastes and  values were  manipulated and  profitably exploited by  the
increasingly dominant service sectors of managerial capitalism. So far from
being a formula of rebellion, as Marcuse and Brown believed, the hedonism
of the counter-culture was the principal means of its assimilation within the
mass economic apparatus and was part of the manipulative discipline that
under  managerial capitalism replaces the  internalized bourgeois  ethic  of
deferred gratification.
Not least among the reasons for the waning of the impulse [of the counter-culture] was the
ease with which the dominant culture absorbed it. Indeed, despite the generational warfare
that marked the late 1960s, hippies were only a spectacular exaggeration of tendencies
transforming the larger society. The root of these tendencies, to borrow a phrase from
Daniel Bell, was a “cultural contradiction of capitalism.” By solving the problems of want,
industrial [i.e., managerial] capitalism undermined the very virtues that made this triumph
possible, virtues like hard work, self-denial, postponement of gratification, submission to
social discipline, strong ego mechanisms to control the instincts. As early as the 1920s the
system of mass production depended less on saving than consumption, not on denial but
indulgence.
## [503]
Such tendencies toward hedonism and an ethic that rationalized it were
not confined to the young and the dissident but were increasingly common
among older and more mainstream groups.
Parental discipline declined, sexual promiscuity rose along with the divorce rate, worker

productivity fell, ghetto obscenity insinuated itself into standard speech, marijuana became
almost commonplace,  sexual perversions were  no  longer deemed so,  and  traditional
institutions like the Army, the churches, and the government lost authority. . . . Dionysus
had been absorbed into the dominant culture and domesticated, and in the process routed
the Protestant ethic.
## [504]
The ethic of hedonism and the decomposition of the bourgeois ethic of
deferred gratification were part of the erosion of the American social myth
and the attempt to replace it with a new myth that reflected the interests of
the soft managerial elite and the new civilization that it sought to create.
There were, of course, some in the New Left who did not fully conform
to the Class I residues that prevailed in the elite and whose disposition to
violence reached pathological levels  in  the  early  1970s. Such  terrorist
groups as the Weathermen and their satellites, however, were not serious
challenges to the regime, regardless of the threat to life and property they
presented. By adopting the tactics of violence, these groups immediately
isolated themselves from the mainstream of the managerial regime as well
as  from  the  mainstream of  the  New  Left,  and  their  absurd plan  of
precipitating “peoples’ war” or underground insurgency in the United States
was easily countered by the regime and crippled by its own futility. In the
late 1970s and early 1980s, when several of the leaders of the Weathermen
surrendered to authorities, long-standing legal charges against most of them
were  dropped or  reduced, and  they  were  simply sent  home, to  be
assimilated by the apparatus at which they had hurled a few stones.
## [505]
The participation in the managerial regime of many of the remaining
adherents of the New Left through political action, academic or journalistic
careers, or actual office-holding had the effect of muting their repudiation
of the regime and its ideology, and the adaptation of managerial ideology to
accommodate some New Left demands tended to resolve the challenge to
legitimacy the  New  Left  had  presented. Yet,  despite its  reforms and

adaptations, the  managerial regime did  not  significantly change. Mass
organizations were not dismantled, and the application of managerial skills
to their direction and control and the continuing extension of such skills
throughout mass  society were  not  abandoned. Indeed, in  the  1970s, the
rapidly emerging “post-industrial” economy and society increasingly relied
on technocracy, the “knowledge sector,” and manipulative disciplines that
were  made  possible by  managerial technique and  new communications
technologies. Post-industrialism encouraged the  processes of  continuous
innovation, displacement of non-managerial institutions and values, and the
manipulation and integration of mass society through the disciplines of a
hedonistic ethic, a cosmopolitan identity, and melioristic political and social
aspirations to be achieved through the scientific application of managerial
functions and techniques.
Although the  challenges mounted by  the  New  Left  never  actually
threatened the  basic  functioning  of  the  regime, they  did  succeed in
discrediting certain policies and practices of the managerial state and much
of the managerial formula of legitimacy. But this challenge was in some
respects consistent with managerial interests, and the regime experienced
no real difficulty in adapting to it and assimilating most of the New Left
within its own organizational and ideological framework. The regime was
able to assimilate the New Left rather easily precisely because the New Left
was  part  of  the  managerial elite,  displayed the  same  psychological and
behavioral dispositions, and  shared many of  the  same  ideological
presuppositions. The latter, instilled in the following of the New Left by the
mass  educational institutions in  which they  had  been  instructed and
reinforced by  the  mass  organizations of  culture and  communication in
which they had been socialized, acted as a homing device by which the
regime manipulated them back into its apparatus and turned their energies

and aspirations to its own uses against persistent bourgeois forces and other
non-managerial centers of  resistance. Confronted by  a  challenge from
forces that  are  essentially similar  or  identical to  the  main  body  of  the
managerial elite, the soft managerial regime displays a capacity to use its
manipulative style of dominance effectively to respond to and assimilate the
challenge. When it  is  confronted by  dissimilar forces that  exhibit no
affinities for  or  attraction to  its  manipulative techniques, however,  the
managerial regime may  find  the  challenges issued by  such  forces less
tractable and more of a threat to its structure and the techniques by which it
holds power.

The Failure of the Bourgeois Resistance
While the  managerial regime was  able  to  assimilate the  New  Left
because its adherents originated from the managerial elite and expressed
goals and values consistent with the interests of the regime, assimilation of
the New Right resistance was more difficult. The mass following of the
New  Right  did  not  derive from  the  managerial elite  and  shared less  in
common with it, and it was thus far less assimilable by and more of a threat
to managerial interests. Nevertheless, the regime eventually absorbed much
of the New Right political movement, or at least its leadership, though the
anti-managerial constituencies of the New Right were not assimilated and
continue to present a potential threat to the managerial regime.
The New Right was not an expression of bourgeois interests and values
but represented post-bourgeois aspirations, and its emergence in the late
1960s and its successes in the following decade suggest that post-bourgeois
strata in American society were beginning to form a distinct identity and
consciousness that differentiated them from both bourgeois and managerial
social  forces. Post-bourgeois  groups  originated in  the  dissolution of  the
bourgeois order in the early 20th century when the revolution of mass and
scale, the formation of mass organizations under managerial control, and
the impact of depression, war, and governmental extension into social and
economic processes pulverized the bourgeois order, eroded its social fabric,
displaced the bourgeois elite from national dominance, and challenged the
legitimacy and  credibility of  bourgeois  ideology.  The American middle
class ceased to be an economically and culturally autonomous social group
and, while it regained affluence after World War II, was integrated into and

disciplined by the managerial economic, political, and cultural apparatus.
Yet  managerial control of  the  post-bourgeois social strata was
incomplete, and  throughout the  1950s and  1960s these  strata  displayed
proclivities to resistance to the managerial regime. The regime alternately
ignored, manipulated, or suppressed these tendencies, and the social force
that consistently sought to make use of them was the bourgeois sub-elite,
which retained a large degree of independence from the managerial regime
and continued to resist its power. Although the interests and values of the
bourgeois sub-elite and those of post-bourgeois strata were not identical and
often were antagonistic, their  common opposition to  managerial
predominance and  post-bourgeois  retention of  bourgeois  values  were
sufficiently strong to create the basis for their common participation in a
political movement. In the two decades after World War II, post-bourgeois
groups lacked sufficient identity to assert their own interests and values
separately from those of the bourgeois sub-elite, and their alliance with
bourgeois forces served to infuse into them an ideological content that later
distorted and deformed their distinctive identity and the New Right political
movement associated  with  it. The  political movement that  they  and  the
bourgeois sub-elite formed in the 1950s and 1960s, with the latter force
predominant in  it,  came  to  be  known as  “conservatism,” and  until  the
emergence of New Left and New Right opposition to the managerial regime
in the late 1960s, it constituted the only major challenge to the regime.
The central political and cultural conflict in the United States from the
1930s until the 1960s was a struggle for power between the managerial
elite, based in  the  mass economic, political, and  cultural and
communicational organizations, on the one hand, and the bourgeois sub-
elite,  based  on  smaller,  more  compact, localized, private, and  social

organizations in  entrepreneurial firms, local  communities, and  local
electoral districts and political institutions, on the other. Ideologically, the
struggle for  power took  the  form  of  the  conflict between managerial
liberalism, which expressed and rationalized the interests of the managerial
elite,  and  bourgeois  conservatism, which expressed and  rationalized the
interests of the bourgeois sub-elite. Politically, the conflict was expressed in
the rivalry between the “Taft wing” of the Republican Party, representing
bourgeois  interests  and  values, and  the  “Eastern wing” led  by Thomas
Dewey, Wendell Willkie, Dwight Eisenhower, and Nelson Rockefeller and
representing managerial interests; in  the  Democratic Party  there  was  a
parallel division between the dominant northeastern section of the party,
also an expression of managerial interests, and its southern and western
branches. In international affairs, the conflict revealed itself in the contest
between an isolationist, nationalist, and anti-communist foreign policy that
reflected the interests and values of the bourgeois sub-elite and its allies,
and a globalist, internationalist, and cosmopolitan foreign policy, supported
by  managerial forces and  expressing their  interests and  ideology.
Constitutionally, the struggle for power between bourgeois and managerial
forces appeared in  the  conflicts between the  managerially dominated
executive branch under the presidency and the federal bureaucracy, usually
in alliance with the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary, and Congress
and  state  and  local  governmental levels, which generally represented
bourgeois forces. There also was a geographical dimension to the conflict,
with the managerial elite and the mass organizations under its control being
situated principally in the northeastern United States and especially in its
mass urban conglomerations, and the bourgeois sub-elite retaining influence
over  rural  and  more  compact power bases  in  the  less  urbanized South,
Midwest, and Far West. The geographical division between managerial and

bourgeois forces tended to import into the conflict the subcultural values
and traditions of these regions as well as economic and political interests
peculiar to them.
Despite the loss of its dominant position, the bourgeois sub-elite retained
considerable private wealth, social status, political influence in Congress
and local political institutions, and regional cultural power, but the diversity
and  localism of  the  structure of  its  power and  the  individualism of  its
ideology and  worldview presented disadvantages in  its  conflict with
managerial forces. Political leaders  representing bourgeois  interests and
values tended to be concerned principally with issues directly relevant to
their constituencies and districts rather than with national or international
issues that served to coordinate a mass following and gain the support of
managerial forces. Similarly,  entrepreneurial capitalists, whose wealth
derived from  locally based, privately owned and  operated, and  usually
comparatively small firms or industries, directed their attention to their own
personal, corporate, or community concerns and tended to take little interest
in more national, international, or abstract economic and political issues
that did not directly affect them. Bourgeois cultural institutions in churches,
schools, and newspapers focused on local matters and displayed little of the
cosmopolitanism of the intellectual and cultural vanguard of the managerial
regime. Ideologically, bourgeois individualism and particularism served to
legitimize parochialism and self-serving behavior within the bourgeois sub-
elite and its supporters. Thus, the political and economic competition of
bourgeois forces  against the  managerial elite, controlling mass
organizations and resources of colossal reach and scale, was difficult. Both
the  structure of  bourgeois  power  and  interests and  the  basic  bourgeois
mentality enhanced the disadvantages of bourgeois competition with and
resistance to the regime, and in so far as the managerial elite was able to

establish standards of  taste,  high  culture, and  public discourse, it  could
delegitimize bourgeois opponents that did not or could not conform to such
standards.
The bourgeois resistance to managerial power was closely related to the
private business  interests of  entrepreneurial capitalists, who  mainly
provided financing for resistance efforts. They showed little inclination or
capacity to connect their narrow interests with larger questions framed by
ideas and values that were more attractive to intellectual and cultural elites
than  those  of  traditional bourgeois  ideology.  The  principal vehicle for
entrepreneurial capitalist interests in the early 20th century was the National
Association of  Manufacturers (NAM), which faithfully recapitulated the
laissez-faire and anti-union ideology that reflected the economic interests of
most  of  its  components but  exerted no  cultural influence beyond such
components.
Not until the Depression and the New Deal did the bourgeois elite begin
to appreciate the broader dimensions of the managerial challenge, and only
in the 1930s and 1940s did it begin to mount a more aggressive (though still
not very effective) resistance to managerial forces. The New Deal exposed a
cultural, intellectual, and political, as well as an economic, schism between
bourgeois  and  managerial groups.  What  E.  Digby  Baltzell called the
“schizophrenia within the  business community” that  the  New  Deal
produced was  largely  a  division between bourgeois  and  managerial
interests. While Roosevelt at  first  attracted broad support among
businessmen, the  radical appearance of  his  administration and  the
enactment of  labor  and  social security legislation alienated many
entrepreneurial capitalists, high  bourgeois,  and  corporate managers who
retained bourgeois values and beliefs.

[T]he real schizophrenia within the ranks of the business community came, by and large
but of course not entirely, from the conflict between this old-stock concentration in the
older, more production-oriented seats of economic power and the newer consumer and
communications branches of the business community.
## [506]
The  latter  sectors were  “more  likely to  support the  New  Deal
economically because of  its  efforts  to  redistribute wealth and  place
purchasing power in the hands of the masses of consumers,” and
The  nature of  the  schizophrenia which divided the  business establishment during the
thirties was nicely illustrated in the career of Gerard Swope. He and such men as Owen
D.  Young and Alfred P.  Sloan, Jr., were leaders of the managerial revolution which took
place in American business leadership between the two wars.
## [507]
The  distinction  between “older,”  “production-oriented” sectors and
“newer” consumer-oriented sectors tended to  correspond to  the  division
between corporations in  which entrepreneurial and  bourgeois  interests
remained dominant or influential and those in which managerial leadership
had  already  emerged.  The  latter  depended on  a  high  level  of  mass
consumption to sustain their growth and on massive and complex marketing
systems to distribute, and advanced technologies to produce, their goods
and  services; and  the  size,  scale,  and  complexity of  such  functions
intensified their  need  for  managerial and  technical skills.  Because such
corporations tended to be newer, they tended to be less encumbered with the
dominance of individual entrepreneurs, their families, and their bourgeois
ideological reflexes.
The  political divisions among  businessmen in  the  1930s did  not
exclusively correspond to  the  organizational distinctions among their
businesses, however. The high bourgeois elite was divided between those
who had absorbed progressivist ideas and who supported the New Deal for
non-economic reasons and  those  who  remained attached to  traditional
bourgeois  beliefs  and  values, even  when  their  economic interests had

become dependent on managerial capitalist corporate activities. Corporate
managers themselves often retained or had acquired bourgeois values and
also opposed the New Deal policies because of such preconceptions and
mental habits. Nevertheless, as John Kenneth Galbraith notes, there was
distinct correlation between acceptance of the New Deal and managerial
business firms, on the one hand, and resistance to it and entrepreneurial
firms, on the other.
The opposition to the rising power of the state in the decisive years of the thirties, like the
opposition to the rising power of the unions, was led not by the mature corporations but by
the surviving entrepreneurs. The names of Ernest Weir, Thomas Girdler, Henry Ford, the
Du Ponts and Sewell Avery are associated with this resistance. General Motors, General
Electric, U.S.  Steel and other mature corporations were much more inclined to accept such
innovations as  NRA, to  be  more  philosophical about  Roosevelt and  otherwise  to
accommodate themselves to the New Deal.
## [508]
Other reasons besides economic interest attracted corporate managers to
the New Deal and repelled bourgeois and entrepreneurial elements. The
managerial corporation and its elite had less interest in the institution of
hard  property and  the  rights  of  ownership than  entrepreneurial and
bourgeois elements and were not significantly threatened by the extension
of  governmental power into  property relationships. The  progressive and
cosmopolitan ambience of  the  New  Deal  was  consistent with  the
meritocratic values of corporate managers whose proficiency in managerial
and  technical skills  rather than  social status, family connections, and
adherence to  bourgeois  social and  moral codes  was  the  basis  of  the
advancement of their careers. According to Baltzell, the ethnic tolerance
and pluralism encouraged by the New Deal also attracted new managerial
elements.
[I]t was the members of the newer ethnic minorities, especially the Jews, who supported
the New Deal because they had taken the lead in developing these newer, consumer fields,
partly because of the caste monopoly of the older centers of production and commercial
banking maintained by established members of the old stock upper class.
## [509]

For  converse reasons, cosmopolitan and  meritocratic values,  ethnic
pluralism, and the challenge to property rights contributed to the resistance
to the New Deal by bourgeois forces.
The principal vehicle for bourgeois resistance to the political phase of
the  managerial revolution in  the  New  Deal  was  the  American Liberty
League (ALL), founded in 1934 and supported mainly by “businessmen and
self-employed professionals to resist the growth of what has come to be
known as the ‘welfare state.’”
## [510]
The major contributors to the ALL were
drawn from the high bourgeois elite, although managerial executives who
adhered to bourgeois political and economic ideology also were supportive
of  it,  and  the  League acquired  sizable contributions from  smaller
businessmen throughout the country. Nevertheless, the League was never a
broad-based organization and was unsuccessful in its efforts to attract a
mass following and rejuvenate bourgeois beliefs. The League reached its
maximum membership (which involved nothing more than sending one’s
name and address to its national headquarters in Washington) of 124,856 in
1936 and subsequently declined until it was disbanded in 1940. In the six
years of its existence it collected and disbursed nearly $1,200,000, and most
of its money was spent on the salaries of its staff, building up its state
organizations, and  promoting its  propaganda.
## [511]
One  of  its  principal
supporters was  Pierre  S.  DuPont,  who,  with  a  handful of  other  men  of
wealth, virtually sustained the League in the mid 1930s.
[F]ewer than two dozen bankers, industrialists, and businessmen contributed over half the
League’s funds for 1935; and nearly 30 per cent of all League funds for that year was from
the du Pont family. In 1936, approximately two thirds of the money came from thirty men
contributing $5,000 or more apiece; and one of every four dollars spent was from the
pockets of the du Ponts.
## [512]
After 1936 contributions to the ALL dwindled, and businessmen who
pledged contributions often failed to make them.

Pierre DuPont himself was an outstanding example of an entrepreneurial
capitalist who came to depend on managerial functions. With two cousins
he had purchased control of the family firm in 1902, had developed it into a
major corporate enterprise, and  had  himself instituted a  managerial
reorganization of  the  company.  He  and  his  family continued to  own,
operate, and direct the firm as managers themselves, though their fortune
eventually became dependent on managerial capitalism.
At Du Pont, owners still managed in 1917. Pierre and his brothers maintained control
through an intricate network of holding companies. . . . Nevertheless, the only Du Ponts to
serve  on  the  executive  committee were  experienced managers. .  .  By  the  1930s  top
managers outnumbered the family on the Du Pont board.
In  recent years  Du  Pont,  so  long  cited  as  a  preeminent family firm,  has  become
managerial. . . . Still owners, du Ponts no longer manage. They no longer make significant
industrial decisions.
## [513]
Despite their dependence on and benefits from managerial capitalism,
DuPont and most of his family retained the beliefs and values of the high
bourgeois  elite,  and  their  support of  the ALL  and  other  anti-Roosevelt
activities reflected their  adherence to  bourgeois  ideology as  large-scale
entrepreneurs. John  J.  Raskob and  Alfred P.  Sloan, Jr.,  who  were
professional managers active in the ALL, were closely tied to the DuPont
family through the  latter’s  controlling interest in  the  General Motors
Corporation, which Raskob and Sloan had directed.
The  narrowness of  the  base  of  the  ALL  means that  it  cannot be
considered to have represented any significant social force, although its
undiluted assertion of bourgeois ideology reveals its social composition.
The facile transparency of its propaganda and the vast wealth of its major
contributors and supporters account in large part for its failure to mobilize
more  effective resistance to  the New  Deal.  Nevertheless, while the
ideological content of  its  propaganda was  conventionally bourgeois,  the

League sought to  use  moral, religious, patriotic, and  constitutionalist
themes as well as appeals to laissez-faire economic principles to attract
support and build a case against Roosevelt’s policies. The ALL “launched
the  most  intense and  concentrated campaign to  propagate conservative
political and economic thought that the United States had ever witnessed,”
and it espoused “a philosophy that was at once a combination of Social
Darwinism, laissez-faire economics, Old  Testament apocalypse, and
Constitution and ancestor worship.”
## [514]
It combined these bourgeois themes
with a ferocious hatred of Roosevelt as a class renegade and insinuations of
communist influence in his administration. Through such appeals to values
not directly connected to bourgeois economic interests and through its use
of mass propaganda, the ALL sought, albeit unsuccessfully, to attract and
mobilize mass  support for  the bourgeois  order  and  to  develop a  more
aggressive and  mass-oriented resistance to  managerial power than  was
typical of earlier bourgeois efforts.
Yet  by  the  end  of World  War  II  high  bourgeois  resistance to  the
managerial regime had dwindled, and support for resistance efforts became
concentrated among a  handful of  wealthy high  bourgeois and
entrepreneurial magnates and  middle-class entrepreneurs who  retained a
commitment to  the  traditional bourgeois  worldview and  to  their  group
interests as small businessmen. The revival of the national economy after
the  war,  the  emergence of  a  “corporate culture” under managerial
dominance, and the dependence of the higher reaches of the bourgeois sub-
elite on managerial capitalism and the managerial regime served to prevent
any  serious attention among high  bourgeois  elements to  continuing
resistance to managerial power. Thereafter, only the personal idiosyncrasies
of  particular members of  the  high  bourgeois sub-elite, rather  than  their
group interests, led them to support organized resistance to the managerial

regime.
The  effect  of  this  separation of  high  bourgeois interests from
conservative resistance was to reduce the social status and organizational
and financial resources of the latter and to deracinate it as a political and
ideological movement that might reflect the interests and aspirations of a
major social force. Although smaller entrepreneurial interests and bourgeois
values remained the  prevalent force  in  conservative ideology,  and  thus
perpetuated the  bourgeois  identity of  conservatism, the  conservative
political and  intellectual movement that  emerged  in  the  1950s was  not
closely tied to high bourgeois material interests and social values, and the
petty  bourgeois  interests it  reflected were  not  sufficiently significant or
powerful to make the conservative challenge a successful one. Bourgeois
conservatism thus  became a  socially isolated political and  intellectual
movement that ceased to reflect powerful interests or widely shared ideas
and values, and it increasingly relied on post-bourgeois political support to
mobilize resistance to the managerial regime.
The major bourgeois political challenge to the regime in the post-war era
was the movement led by Senator Joseph McCarthy, whose ascendancy was
possible only because of the weakness of bourgeois forces. Had such forces
not become moribund, McCarthy’s career probably would not have been
possible, and leadership would have devolved upon more typically high
bourgeois figures such as Senator Robert Taft. The inability of such figures
as  Taft  to  mobilize a  national  following indicates not  only  their  own
weakness and  social isolation but  also  the  irrelevance of  bourgeois
conservatism as  a  formula for  anti-managerial resistance. The  ability of
figures such  as  McCarthy and,  later,  Richard Nixon, neither of  whom
originated from the bourgeois elite, to assume leadership of the resistance

and gain a national following outside bourgeois ranks suggests that post-
bourgeois forces were emerging as the political base of the resistance to the
regime.
McCarthy’s political following, in the analysis of Michael Paul Rogin,
derived from two main sources. On the one hand, to “the traditional right
wing of the midwestern Republican Party,” McCarthy “seemed to embody
all their hopes and frustrations.”
To them, communism was not the whole story; their enemies were also the symbols of
welfare capitalism and cosmopolitanism. These militants were mobilized by McCarthy’s
“mass” appeal. Yet this appeal had its greatest impact upon activists and elites, not upon
the rank-and-file voters. And while McCarthy mobilized the Republican right wing, he did
not change its traditional alliance. This was not a “new” American Right, but rather an old
one with new enthusiasm and new power.
## [515]
This component of McCarthy’s following was largely bourgeois in its
cultural and political values and entrepreneurial in its economic interests.
Thus, a study of attitudes toward McCarthy in Bennington, Vermont, in
1954  found substantially stronger support for  him  among “small
businessmen, including merchants and  other  proprietors,” than  among
“salaried employees, including lower  and  upper  white  collar,  salaried
professionals, and executives,” and the data of the study indicated
that small businessmen in our society disproportionately tend to develop a generalized
hostility toward a  complex of  symbols and  processes bound up  with  industrial
capitalism: the steady growth and concentration of government, labor organizations, and
business enterprises; the correlative trend toward greater rationalization of production and
distribution; and the men, institutions, and ideas that symbolize these secular trends of
modern society.  These trends and  their  symbols were,  we  believe, McCarthy’s  most
persuasive targets. Quite apart from the questions of Communists in government, and
blunders or worse in foreign policy, the congruence between McCarthy’s attacks on and
small businessmen’s hostility to the dominant characteristics and tendencies of modern
society account, we believe, for much of the disproportionate support McCarthy gained
from small businessmen.
## [516]
The institutions to which McCarthyite small businessmen were hostile
were those central to the managerial regime, and “communism” appears to

have become a symbol by which these institutions, the elite that controlled
them, and  the  policies and  ideology associated with  them  could  be
described and attacked.
While “Conservative Republican activists provided McCarthy with the
core  of  his  enthusiastic support,” non-bourgeois  groups, “the  lower
socioeconomic groups, the more poorly educated, and the Catholics,” were
his other major source of support, while “the big business and professional
classes, the better educated, and the Protestants” tended to oppose him.
## [517]
The principal reason for non-bourgeois, working and lower class, support
for  McCarthy appears to  have  been  concern with  the  external threat  of
communism during the Korean War,  and  McCarthy’s  ability to  elicit
support among this stratum suggests the beginnings of a post-bourgeois
resistance to the managerial regime.
Unlike earlier bourgeois political leaders, McCarthy did not emphasize
the political and economic ideology of the bourgeois sub-elite but relied on
anti-communist, nationalist, and  patriotic formulas that  he  rhetorically
connected to  his  anti-establishment and  anti-elitist appeals. While his
attacks on the establishment did little to attract mass support, his avoidance
of conventional bourgeois ideology allowed him to gain a following outside
bourgeois  ranks  among elements  that  would have  been  alienated by
invocations of laissez-faire economics and the minimal state. The strong
opposition to McCarthy from organized labor as well as from the national
media may  have  prevented him  from  mobilizing this  support among
workers into a more permanent and effective political movement; but by
diluting, obscuring, or abandoning appeals to formulas that transparently
served bourgeois economic interests and by using patriotic formulas, he was
able  to  gain  the  sympathy of  groups that  had  historically shown little

attraction to bourgeois and anti-managerial ideology and thus to threaten the
cohesion of  the  mass  base  of  the  managerial regime. Post-bourgeois
consciousness in  the  early  1950s was  not  yet  sufficiently strong to
overcome traditional voting patterns and  the  mass  disciplines of  the
managerial regime, but  the  rudimentary support for  McCarthy among
working class elements suggests an incipient consciousness on their part
that  eventually evolved into  an  anti-managerial social and  political
movement separate from bourgeois forces.
While opposition  to  and  hatred of  McCarthy was  strong within  the
managerial elite in the governmental bureaucracy, the larger universities
and media, and large corporations, a portion of the elite centered around
Eisenhower in the Republican Party exploited McCarthy’s popularity and
the anti-communist issue he had developed for its own political purposes.
Eisenhower himself intensely disliked McCarthy because of his attacks on
General George Marshall and on Paul Hoffman, founder of the Committee
for  Economic Development, president of  the  Ford  Foundation, and  a
principal managerial supporter of Eisenhower against Robert Taft. Despite
his dislike, Eisenhower campaigned with McCarthy in Wisconsin and used
the same anti-communist rhetoric in his speeches.
## [518]
Eisenhower’s election
and subsequent administration, however, in no way challenged managerial
dominance but in fact consolidated it, and, as president, Eisenhower resisted
and helped to undermine McCarthy. Even managerial forces outside the
Republican Party, while they did not directly exploit McCarthy for their
own ends, made use of anti-communist rhetoric and measures to assist their
consolidation of  power and  to  manipulate mass  anti-communist and
nationalist sentiments.
The consensus ideology and the consolidation phase of the managerial

regime thus assimilated the anti-communist and nationalist themes of the
bourgeois  resistance  while  ignoring bourgeois  anti-managerial impulses.
This managerial tactic of selective assimilation of challenges to the regime
was  consistent with  the  prevalent  Class  I  residues of  the  elite  and  the
manipulative style of dominance on which it relied, and it was later used in
the managerial response to the New Left challenge. In the 1950s selective
assimilation was effective partly because of McCarthy’s own personal and
political vulnerabilities but  also  because the  lack  of  a  distinct  identity
among post-bourgeois forces and the strength of the managerial apparatus
of  social  control prevented the  formation of  a  mass  anti-managerial
movement and  allowed the  apparatus of  mass  unions, political parties,
national media, and the state to continue the integration of potentially anti-
managerial forces.
The  ideological  efforts  of  the  bourgeois  resistance in  the  1950s  also
revealed the  effect  of  the  erosion  of  high  bourgeois  power and  social
cohesion. What George  H.   Nash  calls  the  “conservative intellectual
movement,” centered mainly around the journal National Review, reflected
bourgeois  conservative ideology in  its  general defense of  laissez-faire
economics, a  minimal state,  an  anti-communist and  nationalist foreign
policy, and a cultural and moral traditionalism that derived from the ascetic
individualism of  the  bourgeois  ethic.  The  principal exponents of  this
movement, however,  were  distinctly different from  the  elite  of  the
bourgeois order and were often alien to or alienated from it. A noticeable
number of foreign-born intellectuals were present among the academics and
professional verbalists who articulated conservative ideology in the 1950s
and 1960s, and a strong presence of ethnic Catholics, Jews, Southerners,
and  ex-Communists distinguished them  from  the  typically northeastern
Anglo-Saxon Protestant composition  of  the  bourgeois  elite.  Moreover,

conservative intellectualism in the 1950s intentionally addressed itself to
the  managerial intelligentsia and  purposely avoided the  “grassroots”
constituencies of  bourgeois  and  post-bourgeois  social forces. William
F. Buckley, Jr., the founder and editor of National Review,
forcefully rejected what he called “the popular and cliché-ridden appeal to the ‘grass-
roots’” and strove instead to establish a journal which would reach intellectuals. Not all
conservatives agreed with this approach, but the young editor-to-be was firm. It was the
intellectuals, after all, “who have midwived and implemented the revolution. We have got
to have allies among the intellectuals, and we propose to renovate conservatism and see if
we can’t win some of them around.”
## [519]
The  goal  of  converting the  managerial intelligentsia to  bourgeois
conservative ideology was  a  virtual impossibility,  however,  since  this
ideology,  regardless  of  its  intellectual merits, could not  express or
rationalize the interests and needs of the managerial elite and was in no way
attractive to it. Bourgeois conservatism as an intellectual movement thus
succeeded only  in  marginalizing  itself  by  becoming a  dissident faction
within the managerial intellectual and verbalist class and isolating itself
from  both  bourgeois  and  post-bourgeois  forces, and  it  exerted little
influence on either.
By  insulating themselves from “grassroots” elements and  by
concentrating their efforts on the managerial intelligentsia and its ideology,
leaders of the conservative intellectual movement and those few politicians
associated with it were selecting only one component of the managerial
regime as a focus of their resistance. Under the slogan that “ideas have
consequences,” conservative intellectuals tended to ignore the structural and
organizational foundations of the managerial regime and to emphasize only
its ideological extensions. In doing so, conservative intellectuals placed the
cart before the horse, since managerial ideology was not the source of the
dominance of the elite but an adaptation to the regime and a reflection and

rationalization of the interests of its elite. The most erudite and sharply-
worded critiques of managerial ideology therefore did not jeopardize the
dominance of the elite, which could ignore the ideological challenge from
the right because this challenge was irrelevant to and was not connected
with any significant social force that resisted the organizational base of its
dominance. Furthermore, by  seeking a  dialogue with  the  managerial
intelligentsia and  by  ignoring the  structural basis  of  managerial  power,
conservative intellectuals generally neglected to develop a critique of the
structure of the regime and gradually came to defend the structure under the
illusion that  the  ideology,  and  not  the  structure itself,  was  their  main
adversary.  The  goal  of  the  conservative intellectual movement was  to
persuade the elite to change its ideological defenses to a form of bourgeois
conservatism, not to delegitimize and dismantle the structures by which the
elite  held  power.  Not  only  was  this  goal  futile because  of  the
incompatibility of the interests of the elite with bourgeois ideology, it also
eventually served to assimilate conservative intellectualism to the defense
of the regime itself. By the late 1960s, conservative intellectuals took the
lead in defending managerial capitalism, the managerial state, and much of
the managerial apparatus of culture and communications against the New
Left challenge, and long after managerial liberalism had ceased to defend
the Vietnam War, deracinated bourgeois conservative intellectuals continued
to  defend the  disastrous and  incompetent experiment in  managerial
globalism.
While conservative intellectuals mounted a  sophisticated critique  of
managerial ideology, their neglect of, and often contempt for, “grassroots”
bourgeois and post-bourgeois resistance to the regime left this dimension of
the  resistance without a  coherent ideology,  and  the  adherents of  the
“grassroots” conservative resistance  generally subscribed to  simplistic,

conspiratorial formulas that expressed social resentments and frustrations
but could not be credited by more than a small part of the politically active
population. Grassroots resistance in the 1950s and 1960s thus came to be
known as the “radical right” and was organized in such groups as the John
Birch Society, the Ku Klux Klan, the Minutemen, the Citizens Councils,
and  similar extremist, fringe, or  violent movements. While the
conspiratorial and  radical ideology of  such  groups often  contained an
opaque perception  of  the  structural basis  of  managerial power,  the
perception was so distorted and lacking in intellectual sophistication as to
be worthless as a mobilizing force. The disjunction between conservative
intellectualism and  bourgeois  and  post-bourgeois  political and  social
resistance movements thus fragmented the resistance and prevented it from
effectively challenging the consolidation and later the acceleration of the
managerial regime. In 1965 National Review, which remained the principal
organ of conservative intellectualism, repudiated the John Birch Society in
an  effort  to  reconcile itself  with  the  managerial intelligentsia, and  it
periodically repeated its exorcism of “right wing extremists” with George
Wallace in 1968 and other post-bourgeois resistance movements. When, in
the 1970s, a more powerful “grassroots” resistance movement developed in
American politics, the  exponents of  “Old Right” conservative
intellectualism found themselves increasingly isolated from it and rejected
by its activists and leaders.
By the 1960s, with McCarthy dead and discredited and Nixon defeated
by John F.  Kennedy, the bourgeois political and intellectual resistance was
in a state of collapse. Its momentary resurgence in the Goldwater campaign
of 1964 succeeded only in capturing the Republican Party from its eastern,
managerial wing. The unadulterated expression of bourgeois economic and
political ideology by Goldwater, who differed from McCarthy and Nixon in

his own high bourgeois background, found little support outside bourgeois
ranks  because the  ideology had  ceased to  reflect the  interests and
aspirations of  any  significant social  force  other  than  the  dwindling old
bourgeois sub-elite and its fragments. Although Goldwater was supported
by  new  entrepreneurial forces in  the  southwest (as  well  as  by  old
entrepreneurs), who saw in his campaign a vindication of entrepreneurial
capitalist interests,
## [520]
his opposition to the civil rights movement received
considerable support and won him the only states that he carried other than
his own state of Arizona.
While Goldwater opposed civil  rights legislation on  the  basis  of
bourgeois constitutionalist principles rather than  on  overt  racial
consciousness, it is likely that race was the basis of the popular response to
his position. Neither McCarthy nor the bourgeois resistance of the 1930s
and 1940s had made any political appeal to racial solidarity and sentiment,
and its presence in the election of 1964 and subsequent elections indicates a
transition from  a  bourgeois  to  a  post-bourgeois  consciousness  as  the
ideological formula of resistance. Whereas the former was distinguished
principally by  the  defense of  the  economic and  political interests of
bourgeois and entrepreneurial forces, which progressively declined from the
position of a nationally dominant elite to that of a sub-elite and finally to a
dispersed social fossil, the post-bourgeois resistance was distinguished by
its defense of a social and cultural identity, with political implications. The
first national political figure to express this identity explicitly was not Barry
Goldwater, however, but George Wallace, and the political movement that
developed from his campaigns in 1968 and 1972 became the basis for the
major anti-managerial force in the latter part of the 20th century.

## THE POST-BOURGEOIS
## RESISTANCE
## The Post-bourgeois Proletariat
Neither the radicalism of the New Left nor the bourgeois conservatism
of the Old Right succeeded in their efforts to mobilize successful challenges
to  the  managerial  regime. The  New  Left  failed because most  of  its
adherents derived from the managerial elite itself, shared the worldview,
values, and interests of the elite, and were rather easily assimilated within
the mass organizations under managerial control. The Old Right resistance
failed  because the  bourgeois  ideology that  it  espoused represented the
interests and values of a declining social class unable to compete effectively
against its  ascendant managerial  rival  and  unable to  attach itself  to  a
sufficiently significant social force outside the bourgeois sub-elite to sustain
its  resistance. In  short,  both  challenges failed  because they  remained
socially and politically isolated from the social forces that were emerging
within the soft managerial regime and without the support of which no
successful challenge to the regime was possible.
Yet, while the New Left and the Old Right failed to overthrow or replace
the managerial regime, they both enjoyed partial successes. The former,
principally through its skill in manipulating the mass organs of culture and
communication, was able to modify and influence managerial ideology and
policies. The  Old  Right, mobilizing considerable financial and  political
resources from  the  bourgeois  sub-elite, also  was  able  to  restrain the

acceleration of the regime and to preserve significant political influence at
the local, state, and congressional levels of government. But the Old Right
was  unable to  win  control of  the  executive branch, the  core  of  the
managerial state, because it could not mobilize a mass following in national
elections, and its failure, which prevented it from seizing control of the
managerial governmental apparatus and perhaps from dismantling it, was
due ultimately to its insularity and its crystallized attachment to obsolescent
bourgeois ideology and interests. Whatever political following it attracted
on  a  national level  was  increasingly due,  not  to  the  revitalization of
bourgeois conservatism, but rather to a fragile and uneasy alliance with
emerging  social  groups that  were  neither bourgeois  nor  managerial and
harbored increasingly bitter frustrations with the soft managerial regime.
Joseph McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Barry Goldwater, George Wallace, and
Ronald Reagan all  enjoyed whatever political success they  achieved
because of their appeal to these relatively new sociopolitical forces.
These new  forces, the  post-bourgeois  groups that  originated in  the
collapse of the bourgeois order under the impact of the revolution of mass
and scale in the early part of the 20th century, are distinct from both the
managerial elite and the bourgeois sub-elite. They are separate from the
managerial elite because they lack the advanced technical and managerial
skills, and generally lack the opportunity to acquire such skills, that yield
control of the mass organizations of the regime and social and political
dominance. They are also separate from the bourgeois sub-elite because
they lack its distinctive feature, the ownership and operation of their means
of subsistence in the form of the hard property of the entrepreneurial firm.
In the hierarchy of society, post-bourgeois groups constitute for the most
part the working and lower middle classes, dependent for their economic
subsistence on  the  mass  organizations (corporations and  unions) of

managerial capitalism, and they consist in part of dislocated and declining
bourgeois  elements of  rural  or  urban  background as  well  as  of  equally
dislocated but economically ascending working class elements of European
or native origin. They are also materially (but not entirely psychically and
socially) integrated into the mass structures of the managerial state and the
apparatus of  culture and  communication. Concentrated in  mass  urban
conglomerations, occupying mass  residential facilities in  the  form  of
apartment complexes  and  housing developments, commuting  on  mass
transportation networks, producing and consuming within mass offices and
factories and mass shopping centers, disciplined, informed, and entertained
by the mass media of culture and communication, passively participating in
the mass political apparatus, and supplied by and subordinated to the legal,
administrative, and  social  services of  the  mass  state,  the  post-bourgeois
strata, despite their relative affluence, constitute a proletariat within the soft
managerial regime that the regime has been unable to assimilate socially or
psychologically.
The proletarianization of the middle class was noted by Andrew Hacker,
who remarked on the new dependency of the post-bourgeois groups that
resulted from their assimilation into the mass organizations of the economy
and from the dematerialization of property.
[P]ostwar America’s new middle class stands in a continual condition of dependency. Its
members are employees, and their livelihoods are always contingent on the approval and
good will of the individuals and organizations who employ them.
What needs emphasis is that this group lacks the significant characteristics of past middle
classes in American society. It is expansive rather than attenuated, national rather than
local, and propertyless and dependent rather than propertied and secure. In fact, the new
middle class  has  many  attributes in  common with  the  traditional conception of  a
proletariat. And it is possible to argue that those who were once known as the working
class have simply put on white collars.
## [521]
C. Wright Mills, surveying the emergence of “white collar” groups in

American society,  commented  on  the  social and  psychological
transformation that  the  decline of  hard  property and  the  entrepreneurial
economy of the bourgeois order involved:
Changes in the spread and type of property have transformed the old middle class, changed
the way its members live and what they dream about as political men, have pushed the free
and independent man away from the property centers of the economic world. . . . The
centralization of property has thus ended the union of property and work as a basis of
man’s essential freedom, and the severance of the individual from an independent means
of livelihood has changed the basis of his life-plan and the psychological rhythm of that
planning. For the entrepreneur’s economic life, based upon property, embraced his entire
lifetime and was set within a family heritage, while the employee’s economic life is based
upon the job contract and the pay period.
## [522]
The  dematerialization of  property and  the  replacement of  the
entrepreneurial firm as the dominant form of economic organization by the
mass corporations and unions under managerial control eroded both the
economic power base of the bourgeois elite as well as the institutional roots
of the bourgeois worldview. The re-organization of the population from the
particularized, localized, private, and  family and  community centered
institutions of  the  bourgeois  order  into  the  massive, anonymous, highly
mobile, homogenized, and routinized disciplines of the managerial regime
subverted the  bourgeois  worldview and  the  ideologies based  on  it  by
rendering its ideas and values irrelevant to the actual life-styles of post-
bourgeois  groups.  The  proletarianization of  the  post-bourgeois  social
formations thus consists not only in the disappearance of economic and
social  autonomy  through the  erosion of  hard  property and  independent
ownership but also in the cultural dispossession involved in the deracinating
transformation provoked by  the revolution of  mass  and  scale  and  the
dominance of managerial elites.
The protracted duration of the transformation, extending from the late
19th  century through the  1920s and  completed in  the  Depression and

Second World War, disguised its occurrence, and the distractions of the war
and  the  return of  mass  affluence  afterward softened its  impact on  the
bourgeois order. Nevertheless, the long-term result of the proletarianization
of the bourgeois middle class is the emergence of a separate, distinct, and
increasingly alienated anti-managerial post-bourgeois  social force  with
emerging  structural  interests and  a  collective consciousness, neither
bourgeois nor managerial, that constitutes a locus of resistance to the soft
managerial regime. As Mills noted in 1951, “the structural position of the
white-collar mass is becoming more and more similar to that of the wage-
workers. Both are, of course, propertyless, and their incomes draw closer
and  closer  together. All  the  factors  of  their  status  position, which have
enabled white-collar workers to set themselves apart from wage-workers,
are now subject to decline,” and Mills predicted that
In the course of the next generation, a ‘social class’ between lower white-collar and wage-
workers will probably be formed. . . . This will not, of course, involve the professional
strata or the higher managerial employees, but it will include the bulk of the workers in
salesroom and office.
## [523]
Economically dependent on the mass organizations of the regime for
their subsistence and affluence, post-bourgeois strata display little attraction
to bourgeois conservatism and its emphasis on laissez-faire economics, the
rights of property, the minimal state, the ethic of economic individualism,
and other tenets of bourgeois ideology centered on the defense of bourgeois
economic and  political interests. Although post-bourgeois  strata  retain
fragments of  the  bourgeois  worldview,  they  cannot re-integrate these
fragments into a replication of bourgeois ideology because their material
interests and the social and economic conditions in which they live prevent
the formation of a coherent bourgeois consciousness. What has persisted
among post-bourgeois groups from bourgeois ideology are the solidarist
and ascetic themes that emphasize community, kinship bonds, class, racial,

and sexual and national identities, although these ideological fragments are
re-shaped in post-bourgeois consciousness to constitute an emerging and
distinctive post-bourgeois social and political worldview.
The general character of the post-bourgeois mentality corresponds to the
ideologies and  Paretian “derivations” associated with  Class  II  residues
(persistence of aggregates or “lions”): solidarism and attachment to group
identities, authoritarianism, with  low  tolerance of  deviation and  the
subordination of the individual to the group, a disposition to use force as a
means of responding to challenges and problems, and a tendency to “resist
innovation, and  [to]  seek  to  preserve old  forms  and  traditions,” in  S.E.
Finer’s words. While Class II proclivities, when they take ideological form,
are often called “conservatism,” they bear only a superficial resemblance to
the bourgeois conservatism of the Old Right. The individualist and classical
liberal ideas of the latter cannot encompass either the material interests or
the  psychic composition of  post-bourgeois  strata, and  while  bourgeois
conservatism incorporates values such  as  patriotism and  adherence to
traditional morality, the logic of its ideological premises, especially when
divorced from the bourgeois social institutions, moved it toward an abstract
libertarianism that rejected group identities and resembled the cosmopolitan
and hedonistic ethic of managerial ideology.
While post-bourgeois  groups display little  attraction to  bourgeois
conservatism, at least in its pristine and coherent forms, and while they are
economically dependent on  the  mass  organizations of  the  regime, the
predominance of Class II residues and derivations among them constitute a
source of  deep  hostility to  the  cosmopolitan and  hedonistic themes of
managerial liberalism, a derivation associated with Class I residues in the
soft managerial elite. Only in periods of crisis such as depression and war

or  during  the  era  of  managerial consolidation, when  cosmopolitan and
hedonistic themes were muted, could the regime accomplish a satisfactory
integration of post-bourgeois groups or partially succeed in legitimizing its
dominance among them, and even then it did so through direct appeal to
their economic interests and through the manipulation of the public images
of national leaders such as John F. Kennedy, who appeared to exhibit the
patriotism, piety,  aggressiveness, heroic leadership, courage, and
attachment to family and ethnic identity that post-bourgeois groups value.
Post-bourgeois groups manifest hostility not only to the ideology of the
soft managerial regime and to the psychic and behavioral patterns of its
elite but also to the manipulative style of dominance that characterizes the
elite  and  the  tendency to  acceleration on  which the  elite  relies  for  the
preservation and  enhancement of  its  power.  The  managerial  use  of
manipulation and  acceleration not  only  alienates post-bourgeois  groups
culturally and morally but also threatens their economic position and social
status. The acceleration of the managerial state in particular involves an
alliance between the elite and the underclass, and the formulation of public
policies on  behalf of  the  underclass  that  contribute to  inflationary and
economically dysfunctional trends that erode post-bourgeois affluence and
destabilize social roles. Moreover, the application of managerial skills for
the  manipulative amelioration of  social  arrangements intrudes upon  and
subverts the  social institutions in  which post-bourgeois  solidarism is
expressed. Characteristically post-bourgeois hostility to the soft managerial
regime thus  manifests itself  in  anti-liberal ideologies and  movements
among the working and lower middle classes that emphasize group loyalty
and  integrity  (with  nation, class,  community,  race,  family,  religion), the
value of the use of force to respond to challenges, opposition to politically
managed amelioration and  acceleration and  to  both  the  elite  and  the

underclass as agents of undesirable and dysfunctional social change, but
support for the economic security provided by mass organizations
The anti-liberal aspects of the lower middle and working class mentality
have often been noted and appear to be virtually universal in the Western
world. “The poorer strata everywhere,” wrote Seymour Martin Lipset in
## 1960,
are more liberal or leftist on economic issues; they favor more welfare state measures,
higher wages, graduated income taxes, support of trade-unions, and so forth. But when
liberalism is  defined in  non-economic  terms—as support of  civil  liberties,
internationalism, etc.—the correlation is reversed. The more well-to-do are more liberal,
the poorer are more intolerant.
Public opinion data from a number of countries indicate that the lower classes are much
less committed to democracy as a political system than are the urban middle and upper
classes.
## [524]
While the  conventional explanations of  lower-class anti-liberalism
emphasize the lack of education and information available to lower levels
of society, an alternative explanation is that in the soft managerial regimes
of  the  United States and  Western  Europe, Class  II  residues and  the
derivations associated with them tend to be excluded from the elite and to
be  concentrated  in  the  lower  levels  of  the  social  hierarchy.  Since  soft
managerial elites select their members on the basis of their proficiency in
manipulative managerial skills  and  since  such  skills  are  correlated  with
Class I residues, the latter tend to prevail within the elite and to lend it its
character of softness. Skills correlated with Class II residues are of little
value  to  the  elite  for  the  manipulative style  of  dominance on  which it
depends, and  those  elements of  the  population among whom Class  II
residues prevail are  incongruent with  the  psychosocial and  ideological
prerequisites of  the  soft  managerial  elite  as  well  as  with  its  style  and
techniques of dominance. Those persons or groups within whom Class II
residues prevail are thus pushed into the lower levels of society, which then

come  to  exhibit the  anti-liberalism that  characterizes the  post-bourgeois
strata. This polarization of residues, with a concentration of those of one
class within the elite and those of the other class accumulated at the lower
levels, was explicitly predicted by Pareto and is the basis for his theory of
the circulation of elites and of social revolution.
## [525]
Although the  emergence of  a  distinct post-bourgeois  identity  is  a
phenomenon of  the  late  1960s  and  later  decades, its  rudimentary
manifestations seem to have appeared for the first time in the extremist
political movements of the Depression era, when the implications of the
managerial revolution began to make themselves clear, at least in mythical
form, to early post-bourgeois elements.
For the lower middle classes—small tradesmen, clerks, white collar workers, poor farmers,
and skilled laborers—the Depression had been a shocking and humiliating experience. The
loss of business, farm, job, or home, the necessity at last to go on a government “dole,”
had political repercussions both severe and far-reaching.
Some of these Americans had been traditionally conservative in social affairs, emulating
the  richer  middle classes in  their  attitudes toward capitalism. But  the  depreciation of
property values and their own personal losses during the crisis destroyed their sense of
security. . . .
[T]hese disciples of [Father Charles E.] Coughlin were not right-wing conservatives with
substantial power in the business community. Instead, they were often small businessmen
who feared and mistrusted concentration and control in government or business. Lacking
institutionalized roles on the political scene, they looked in time of crisis to a leader whose
boldness and aggressiveness would combat the power and arrogance of the “big shots” and
bureaucrats while not threatening the capitalist system to which they subscribed.
## [526]
The supporters of Father Charles Coughlin, Gerald L.K. Smith, Francis
Townsend, William Lemke, and Huey Long were eventually absorbed by
the national economic recovery in the aftermath of World War II, though
similar forces contributed to  the  national following of  Senator Joseph
McCarthy in the early 1950s. While the core of McCarthy’s support was
drawn from petty bourgeois sources that themselves were in transition to a
post-bourgeois identity, he also attracted lower and working class support

on  the  basis  of  his  anti-communism. The  principal concerns of  this
constituency seem to have been not the internal subversion that McCarthy
emphasized but  rather the  external  menace of  communism  in  Korea,
Europe, and elsewhere. Nevertheless, concerns over the foreign dangers of
communism and the apparent failure of the managerial state to contain or
defeat it connected easily to perceptions of the managerial elite in the state
as  weak,  irresolute, and  ambivalent  or  sympathetic to  communism, and
thence to increasing suspicion and resentment of the elite and its regime.
McCarthy exacerbated these resentments through his rhetorical synthesis of
the  imagery of  upper-class elite  status—Harvard-educated, tea-sipping
diplomats and advisers in striped pants who spoke in pretentious accents
and  equivocating tones—with accusations of  disloyalty,  indifferent
patriotism, and  sympathy for  communism. It  is  likely  that  much  of  the
massive popular support for General Douglas MacArthur in the wake of his
dismissal by  President Truman in  1951  also  represented post-bourgeois
frustrations with the perceived vacillation of a manipulative elite in the
Korean war. MacArthur’s explicit appeals in his public addresses to military
duty, national solidarity, and victory through the effective use of military
force were expressions of post-bourgeois values that contrasted with the
subtleties of  the  containment policy and  global diplomacy that
representatives of the elite expressed and reflected the Class I residues that
prevailed within the elite.
Whittaker Chambers, whose own  social dislocation from  his  petty
bourgeois roots resembled the position of post-bourgeois strata, explicitly
connected the controversy over Alger Hiss with social position in relation to
the ascendant elite of the managerial regime. “The inclusive fact” about
those who supported his accusations against Hiss was that “in contrast to
the  pro-Hiss rally,  most  of  them,  regardless of  what  they  had  made  of

themselves, came from the wrong side of the tracks.”
No feature of the Hiss case is more obvious, or more troubling as history, than the jagged
fissure, which it did not so much open as reveal, between the plain men and women of the
nation, and those who affected to act, think and speak for them. It was, not invariably, but
in general, the “best people” who were for Alger Hiss and who were prepared to go to
almost any length to protect and defend him. . . . It was the great body of the nation,
which, not invariably, but in general, kept open its mind in the Hiss Case, waiting for the
returns to come in.
## [527]
Much of the imagery of popular discontent with the managerial elite and
its  internal  and  external policies toward communism was  that  of
conventional class  resentments. Popular anti-communist expressions
focused on  the  wealth, social status, educational background, and
appearance and mannerisms of the representatives of the elite rather than on
specifically managerial characteristics or on the ideological content of the
alleged communists and communist sympathizers. The persistence of such
conventional resentments in  popular expressions was  due  partly  to  the
absence of  a  clear  perception of  the  nature of  the  social  and  political
revolution that had occurred and partly to the prominence in governmental
circles and the foreign policy elite of high bourgeois figures such as Dean
Acheson, Averell Harriman, Alger Hiss himself, and others who had made
the transition to the managerial elite, reflected its interests and worldview,
and acted as the spokesmen or symbols of its policies. The political use of
class resentments is historically a tactic of the left for the mobilization of
opposition to a dominant elite, and its relocation on the right indicates the
development of a perception that a displacement of elites had occurred,
even if the different character of the new elite was not yet clear to those
who were beginning to resist it, and that the new elite was distinguished by
its adherence to and use of liberal and progressivist ideology. Moreover, the
relative absence of bourgeois economic and political themes in the form of
classical liberalism  and  the  dwindling of  isolationist sentiment and  its

replacement by  a  militant, activist, and  nationalist anti-communism
differentiate the emerging post-bourgeois resistance to the new elite from
the Old Right challenge mounted by the American Liberty League, which
had  reflected the laissez-faire  economics, constitutionalism, and
isolationism of the old bourgeois elite, and from the urbanized, abstract, and
highly intellectualized libertarianism and artificial “traditionalism” of the
conservative intellectual movement of the 1950s and 1960s.
While popular anti-communist rhetoric of the 1950s connected with and
stimulated an incipient post-bourgeois resistance, the issues on which this
rhetoric focused proved ephemeral. The end of the Korean war, the election
of  a  national military hero  as  president, the  withdrawal of Douglas
MacArthur from public life, and the condemnation and subsequent personal
decline of  Joseph McCarthy removed the  immediate sources of  post-
bourgeois  resentment and  the  most  salient icons  of  post-bourgeois
discontent, and the single issue of anti-communism was not sufficiently
broad to encapsulate the full range of post-bourgeois frustrations. In the
period of consolidation, the managerial elite moderated its cosmopolitan
and hedonistic ethic and successfully pacified the alienated social forces
that were emerging. Nevertheless, a somewhat broader and more concrete
expression of  post-bourgeois  consciousness appeared in  the  person of
Richard M. Nixon, the congressional mentor of Whittaker Chambers, whom
Chambers included among those “from the wrong side of the tracks” who
had supported the case against Alger Hiss, and who for some twenty-five
years afterwards would build a successful political career on his ability to
represent the  post-bourgeois mentality that  was  emerging.  Nixon’s
“Checkers speech” of September 23, 1952, remains one of the clearest early
statements of this mentality.

The occasion for the speech was the revelation by the New York Post on
September 18, 1952 that a secret, $18,000 fund for Nixon, senator from
California and vice-presidential candidate of the Republican Party, had been
established by a group of wealthy men in his home state. The revelation led
to  demands  for  Nixon’s  resignation from  the  ticket, a  possibility given
serious consideration by Gen. Eisenhower and some of his close advisers.
The speech, broadcast nationally on radio and television to an audience of
some 55 million, responded to the specific charges against Nixon, but it
departed from  them  to  cast  the  speaker as  a  personification of  post-
bourgeois values. “Most of the thirty minutes” of the address, wrote Eric
Goldman, “was a story of a family, told in a tone of utter earnestness by an
ordinary-looking young man in a none-too-fashionable suit.”
## [528]
Nixon emphasized the modesty of his social origins in a petty bourgeois
home, his personal struggle against adversity, his marriage, his identity as
an ordinary man, and his solidarity with family and nation. His war record,
in his own words, was not “particularly unusual,” and he and his wife were
“like  most  young couples,” with  ordinary possessions—a two-year old
Oldsmobile, a mortgage on their home, a life insurance policy, and a cocker
spaniel, to which his children were devoted. His allusion to the dog and to
the modesty of his wife’s wardrobe—“Pat doesn’t have a mink coat, but she
does  have  a  respectable Republican cloth  coat”—concretized  post-
bourgeois material simplicity and  domesticity,  in  contrast to  the
pretentiousness and corruption of the elite, and played on a recent scandal
of the Truman administration in which an official’s wife had received a
mink coat allegedly in return for political favors from her husband. Nixon’s
determination to “drive the crooks and Communists and those that defend
them  out  of  Washington,” his  resolution not  to  quit  the  campaign, his
reference to his wife’s Irish background, and his peroration on America and

the  greatness of  Gen.  Eisenhower also  incorporated post-bourgeois
resentments of the elite, appealed to national solidarity and ethnic identity,
and evoked a psychological determination associated with Class II residues.
What  is  absent from  the  Checkers  speech, which received massive and
enthusiastic popular support, is  any  reference to  traditional bourgeois
economic and political ideology. There was no criticism of the regulatory
and economic policies of the New Deal and the Truman administration and
no  invocation of  the  minimal state  or  economic individualism. Nixon
presented his  success in  his  struggle against unpromising prospects as
rooted in his family, not in individual aspiration, and as both modest and
uncertain, threatened by his political enemies, rather than the natural result
of  adherence to  the  bourgeois  virtues. The  speech also  reflected post-
bourgeois resentment against an affluent and powerful elite that exploits
and scorns those modest Americans who fight the wars, do the work, raise
the families, pay the taxes, and bear the burdens of American society. The
Checkers speech thus  retained the  ascetic and  solidarist themes of  the
bourgeois  worldview,  but  it  located these  themes in  the  familiar post-
bourgeois society of the Depression era, World War II, and the post-war
period rather than in a mythical or moribund bourgeois order, and divorced
them from the traditional values and interests of the bourgeois elite.
## [529]
Although Nixon’s subsequent political career until its last stage after
1972  was  largely  one  of  accommodation to  the  managerial regime, his
ability to  express post-bourgeois frustrations and  aspirations, later
encapsulated in  his  “silent  majority” and  “New American Majority”
slogans, made him perhaps the most useful political figure in the period of
managerial consolidation. His aggressive anti-communist rhetoric helped to
legitimize the Eisenhower administration against attacks by McCarthy, and
his own administration of the late 1960s and early 1970s assisted the regime

in its assimilation of the challenges from both the dwindling New Left and
the emerging and increasingly militant post-bourgeois resistance. Only at
the  beginning of  his  second administration did  Nixon display any
inclination to  use  his  post-bourgeois  political base  to  challenge the
managerial regime, but  whatever his  intentions after  1972,  they  were
distracted by  the  rapid  collapse  of  his  presidency.  While the  Checkers
speech and similar rhetoric used by Nixon helped form a post-bourgeois
consciousness, most  of  his  own  policies and  administration did  little  to
further the political representation of post-bourgeois interests and values,
which virtually ceased to be visible during the period of consolidation under
## Eisenhower.
It was not until the mid-1960s that post-bourgeois consciousness began
to assume coherent and distinctive form, and the chief precipitant of its
formation at that time was the reaction among post-bourgeois social groups
to  the  acceleration of  the  managerial regime and  its  social  and  cultural
consequences. Several features of the period of acceleration served to call
forth the post-bourgeois reaction and to instigate the birth of an enduring
post-bourgeois resistance to the regime. One precipitant was the chronic
inflation and economic dislocation that the social and economic policies of
managerial acceleration caused. The social status and standard of living of
post-bourgeois groups in particular were jeopardized by the costs of these
policies, as was the legitimacy of the regime itself when it failed to provide
for the economic security of these groups. Secondly, the general revival of
pristine managerial  liberalism, in  place  of  the  muted and  qualified
expression of progressivist ideas and values that had prevailed in the period
of consolidation, led to public rhetoric and actions that deeply alienated the
Class II sensibilities of post-bourgeois groups. In particular, the revival of
progressivist environmentalism, with  its  cosmopolitan, relativist, and

hedonistic implications, offended and challenged the solidarist values of
family,  community,  nation, and  sexual and  ethnic identity as  well  as
traditional religious and moral bonds, and the extreme interpretations of
these  implications that  the  New  Left  and  counter-culture expressed
deepened the sense of alienation on the part of post-bourgeois groups. The
resurrection of cosmopolitan and hedonistic values and ideas was reinforced
and  intensified in  the  1960s by  the  sudden expansion of  the  mass
organizations of culture and communication through new technological and
organizational developments and  by  the  embrace of  cosmopolitan and
hedonistic ideas  and  values by  the  managerial elite  within these
organizations as  a  means of  rationalizing the  interests of  the  elite  and
extending their  institutional reach.  Thirdly,  the  apparent failure of  the
managerial regime to deal adequately with internal and external challenges
tended to  delegitimize the  regime among the  demographic core  of  its
habitual supporters in post-bourgeois strata. The failures were not confined
to the economy but extended also to the Vietnam war, the rising urban
crime rate, racial riots, the erosion of social manners, tastes, and moral
standards, and the violence and offensiveness of the New Left and counter-
culture themselves. Most of these failures could plausibly be ascribed to the
reluctance or inability of the soft managerial elite to use force competently
or to the tacit or explicit alliance of the elite with the particular groups
involved in these challenges.
Finally, a major source of alienation from the regime on the part of post-
bourgeois groups arose as a consequence of the realignment of the elite that
occurred as a result of the civil rights movement and the legal and political
changes that it encouraged. Post-bourgeois groups began to perceive that
the managerial elite in all sectors, but especially in the state, was neglecting
their interests and aspirations in preference to those of the largely non-white

underclass. The  social, economic, and  cultural chasms between the
underclass and the post-bourgeois groups, the sudden aggressiveness of the
former and of its political leaders, and the acceptance of their demands by
the elite not only alienated post-bourgeois forces from the regime but also
encouraged their perception of the regime and its elite as enemies.
The realignment of the elite with the underclass, particularly its non-
white components, was a necessary part of the period of acceleration. In
order to resume the expansion and extension of the mass organizations of
the regime, the elite was obliged to revive the Caesarist tactics of the period
of managerial emergence. The crystallization of local and private power
bases by the bourgeois sub-elite in the period of consolidation acted as a
constraint on acceleration, and these non-managerial centers of power had
to be overcome if the regime were to expand and if the interests of its elite
were  to  be  enhanced. The  Caesarist tactic  requires for  its  efficacy an
alliance with a mass base as a means of challenging the intermediary power
centers of an elite or sub-elite, and while the working class had served as a
mass base for managerial Caesarism in the period of managerial emergence,
by the late 1960s it was no longer suitable for this role. The working class
of the early 20th century had come to constitute a substantial part of the
post-bourgeois proletariat, which in the early 1960s had few economic or
social grievances and  sought mainly to  conserve the  affluence that  it
derived, at least indirectly, from the economic policies of the regime. Post-
bourgeois elements, especially their working class components, provided
the political base of the elite in the periods of emergence and consolidation
through the political influence of organized labor under managerial control,
but  their  support of  the  elite  and  its  regime was  conditional upon  the
economic security they received, and they were not an adequate base for
accelerating the regime.

Only  the  underclass could  serve  as  a  mass  political base  for  further
acceleration, and in supporting its aspirations and sponsoring the demands
of its leaders, the soft managerial elite in the 1960s essentially abandoned
its historic post-bourgeois constituency in favor of a constituency composed
of the underclass. Responding to the social and economic problems of the
underclass involved a  dramatic expansion of  the social engineering
functions of  the  managerial state  and  its  elite  and  an  opportunity for
virtually limitless enhancement of the powers and rewards of the elite. The
realignment of the elite with the underclass also involved the formulation of
policies that  could be  rationalized only  with  the  environmentalist,
cosmopolitan, and relativist premises of progressivist managerial liberalism.
Environmentalism explained the inferior performance and conditions of the
underclass, offered a course of action in the form of social engineering by
the state for their amelioration, challenged the prevalent values and ideas
that  rationalized discrimination against and  negative judgments of  the
underclass, and provided a critique of racial solidarity while defending a
cosmopolitan fraternalism among racial groups.
While the realignment of elite and underclass certainly enhanced the
economic and  political interests  of  both,  it  precipitated a  far-reaching
reaction within the post-bourgeois base of the managerial regime. At first
this reaction was largely confined to the white constituents of the regime in
the  South,  which supported Goldwater in  1964  less  because of  his
unequivocal defense of  bourgeois  political and  economic ideology than
because his constitutionalist ideas and his commitment to the ideal of the
minimal state led him to oppose federal civil rights legislation and thence,
whatever his  personal feelings on  the  subject, objectively to  defend
traditional race  relationships. By  the  late  1960s, however,  the  post-
bourgeois revolt extended not only to Southern whites but also to northern

urban ethnics, who were activated by racial riots, crime, and urban decay,
the threat to ethnic identity, family, and community, and the inability or
unwillingness of the elite to suppress these threats deriving from its new
allies in the underclass. The post-bourgeois revolt instigated by the alliance
of the soft managerial elite with the non-white underclass was the principal
force behind the political support for Governor George Wallace in 1968
and, prior to an attempted assassination that was highly convenient for his
political rivals in the elite, in 1972. This revolt, connecting to other social,
economic, and cultural discontents, led directly to the formation of the first
distinctively post-bourgeois  political movement, the  New  Right  of  the
1970s and 1980s.

The New Right and the Post-Bourgeois
## Proletariat
Although the  “New  Right” movement that  developed in  the  1970s
enjoyed the  somewhat uneasy support of  “Old  Right” bourgeois
conservative intellectuals and  politicians, operated largely  within the
Republican Party  and  the  Reagan  administration, and  often  expressed
conventional bourgeois  conservative themes, the  main  thrust of  the
movement was not conservative but radical. Its leaders frequently voiced
disdain for the mainstream of both the Republican and Democratic Parties,
for “big” business, labor, media, and government, for nationally established
leaders in  these  sectors of  the  managerial regime, and  even  for
representative figures of  the  Old  Right  such  as Barry  Goldwater  and
William  F.  Buckley,  Jr. The  New  Right  thus  felt  little  kinship with  the
traditional bourgeois conservatism that had provided the main vehicle of
resistance to the managerial regime in the United States since the 1930s, but
at the same time, it clearly exhibited little similarity to the New Left, the
ideological content, agenda, and social composition of which were not only
alien to the New Right but also were frequent targets of its attacks.
The New Right thus occupied an anomalous position. On the one hand,
it  resembled  radical movements  of  the  past  with  its  criticisms of  the
“establishment,” its  demands for  significant changes in  political
arrangements and social mores, and its use of a “grassroots” or populist
strategy of seeking to construct a coalition of non-elite forces led by and
symbolized in a charismatic leader and directed against an elite lodged in
intermediary institutions. On  the  other  hand,  the  New  Right  resembled

conservative movements in its defense of traditional morality and religion,
family, nation, local community, and at times racial integrity and identity.
These conservative features of  the  New  Right  gave  it  its  “right-wing”
character and attracted bourgeois conservative figures to it; but the radical
quality of  the  New  Right  strongly suggests that  the  movement was
originally a genuinely anti-managerial force composed of groups outside
the  managerial elite  and  hostile to  at  least  some  aspects of  the  mass
organizations by  which the  elite  holds  power and  to  the  ideology and
policies that characterize the soft managerial regime.
Despite the anti-managerial radicalism of the New Right, the movement
was eventually deflected from its original goals and, like the New Left of
the previous decade, was assimilated by the managerial regime. The process
of assimilation was completed in the course of the administration of Ronald
Reagan, who, like Eisenhower and Nixon, exploited the mass following and
anti-managerial consciousness offered by the post-bourgeois components of
the  New  Right  but  did  little  to  advance their  goals  after  his  electoral
victories. Indeed, not only were New Right anti-managerial demands not
advanced under Reagan but also the whole anti-managerial direction of the
American right, old and new, was effectively curtailed and countered in the
era  of  his  presidency.  The  process of  assimilation by  which the  elite
circumvented resistance from the right occurred through the separation of
the largely urban, technocratic, and managerial elite that emerged within the
New Right itself from its far more radical and anti-managerial constituency.
The result of the assimilation was the effective decapitation of the post-
bourgeois resistance to the managerial regime. The resistance still exists as
a potentially radical or even revolutionary force in managerial society, but
in the aftermath of the assimilation of Reagan and his administration and of
most of its other erstwhile leaders by the regime and in the absence of other

leaders in their place, its effectiveness as a social and political force in the
future remains questionable.
That the New Right was a political expression of the anti-managerial
radicalism of the post-bourgeois proletariat is clear from its beginnings in
the  presidential  campaigns and  movement associated with  Alabama
Governor George  C.  Wallace. “Typically,”  wrote  demographers Richard
Scammon and Ben J. Wattenberg in 1970, “the Wallace voters are to the
right  of  Republicans  on  race,  law  and  order,  and  big  government—the
Social Issues. But they are to the left of Republicans on bread-and-butter
## Economic Issues.”
## [530]
This apparent duality, schizophrenia, or contradiction
in fact is a distinctive trait of post-bourgeois political consciousness, which
rejects the hedonism and cosmopolitanism in the ideology and ethic of the
soft  managerial elite  that  serve  to  rationalize its  soft  character  and  its
encouragement of continuous acceleration, but also rejects the laissez-faire
economics and  minimal state  of  bourgeois  conservatism. Post-bourgeois
political consciousness accepts the mass organizations of the managerial
regime, particularly those associated with economic functions that provide
“bread and  butter,”  but  seeks  to  rationalize them  with  a  solidarist and
ascetic or  Class  II  ideology corresponding to  the  Class  II  residues that
prevail among post-bourgeois groups. Wallace supporters in the late 1960s
not only shared this consciousness but also were located in typically post-
bourgeois  social  strata  —the  working and  lower  middle classes. While
Scammon and  Wattenberg  characterized Wallace’s  following  as  “the
middle-aged, middle-class, middle-educated, working with their hands,”
## [531]
political scientists Seymour Martin Lipset and Earl Raab found that
The pattern of support for George Wallace before the beginning of the 1968 campaign
resembled that of Father Coughlin and Senator Joe McCarthy, reported earlier. Wallace
was strongest among the less educated, rural, small-town, and working-class population.
As a spokesman of the Protestant South he secured most of his support in the South and

more from Protestants than Catholics.
## [532]
While Wallace’s strength in the South is understandable because of his
own Southern origins and identity, what was remarkable was his following
among northern industrial workers, especially given the failure of Barry
Goldwater to attract such elements in 1964. Goldwater “failed miserably in
the working-class districts of Gary, Milwaukee, and Baltimore, which had
cast large votes for Wallace in the 1964 Democratic Presidential primaries.
Clearly,  Goldwater with  his laissez-faire  antiwelfare-state program went
counter to the desires of the less affluent for social security, trade-unions,
economic planning, and the like.”
## [533]
Wallace’s  appeal to  such  post-bourgeois  forces was  evident in  the
ideological synthesis that he articulated. His rhetoric and platform accepted
the  mass  organizations on  which post-bourgeois  strata  were  materially
dependent but emphasized national, class, and racial solidarity and the use
of force against external and internal enemies and thus provided almost a
definitive formulation of post-bourgeois political and social consciousness.
This synthesis appealed to post-bourgeois Class II residues, and it explicitly
rejected and attacked the Class I residues and ideology that are prevalent
among and characterize the soft managerial elite. Wallace, like Coughlin
and  McCarthy,  made  clear  his  hostility to  the  incumbent elite,  and  his
rhetoric about “pointy-headed intellectuals” and  “briefcase-toting
bureaucrats” identified and  provided a  metaphor for  the  specifically
managerial character of  the  elite  in  symbols more  appropriate than
McCarthy’s anti-communism or Coughlin’s anti-Semitism could do. At the
same time, the platform of Wallace’s American Independent Party endorsed
support for  government-sponsored health care,  education, welfare,
assistance for  the  elderly,  and  legislation in  behalf of  labor  unions and
workers, all  of  which contributed  to  the  denunciations of  Wallace by

bourgeois conservative leaders such as Barry Goldwater, John Ashbrook,
and William Buckley as “a Populist with strong tendencies in the direction
of a collectivist welfare state.”
## [534]
Wallace’s  own  personality dominated the  political movement  that
developed around him, and he failed to institutionalize it in an enduring
organizational vehicle by the time of the assassination attempt on him that
removed him from the national political scene in 1972.
## [535]
## Nevertheless,
many of the distinctively post-bourgeois themes of his movement as well as
its actual adherents provided the core of the New Right in the early and mid
1970s. Popular protest movements against the  use  of  objectionable
textbooks in public schools, federal efforts at forced busing and affirmative
action for racial integration, the Equal Rights Amendment, and the Panama
Canal  Treaties exhibited much  of  the  same  anti-elitist and  anti-liberal
themes that Wallace had expressed. Moreover, a direct connection between
the  Wallace movement and  the  New  Right  existed in  the  person and
activities of political consultant Richard A. Viguerie, who had raised $6.9
million for Wallace’s 1976 presidential campaign through innovative and
aggressive mail  marketing techniques. “Wallace’s  campaign,” writes
political journalist Sidney Blumenthal, “was the real making of Viguerie
and the New Right, for it provided a list of 600,000 names, sifted from a
larger list of contributors, that was as good as gold.”
## [536]
This list of over
half  a  million Wallace supporters and  financial contributors was  “the
hardcore of the New Right,” and its exploitation by Viguerie and his clients
in the late 1970s enabled the New Right to emerge as a national political
force.
The social composition and ideological character of the base of the New
Right movement remained throughout the 1970s and 1980s what it had

been under the leadership of Wallace—working and lower middle class,
though with infusions from new entrepreneurial elements in the southern
and western regions of the United States. The demographic core of this
following has  been  called by  sociologist Donald I.  Warren  “Middle
American Radicals” or MARs, a group defined principally by its ideology
but that displays definite socio-economic correlates. Warren found that in
the early 1970s MARs had an annual family income of $3,000 to $13,000,
that  northern European ethnics and  Italians were  strongly represented
among them, that they were nearly twice as common in the South as in the
north central states, that they tended to have completed high school but not
to have attended college, were more common among Catholics and Jews
than  among Protestants and  among  Mormons and  Baptists than  among
other Protestant sects, and were likely to be males in their thirties or their
sixties. Occupationally, “skilled and semi-skilled blue collar workers” were
common among MARs, who “are slightly less likely to be employed in
clerical, sales and other white collar technical jobs than are others in the
survey. They are significantly less likely to be professional or managerial
workers.”
## [537]
Yet these objective features do not adequately define Middle American
Radicals. What defines them is the ideology that they harbor and which
closely approximates the  post-bourgeois  consciousness that  is  neither
bourgeois nor managerial and conforms to neither bourgeois conservative
nor managerial liberal ideological patterns. Their view of government in
particular is distinctively different from the bourgeois conservative idea of
the minimal state as well as from the managerial liberal idea of an expanded
state  involved in  the  management and  amelioration of  the  social
environment. Rather,
MARs are a distinct group partly because of their view of government as favoring both the

rich and the poor simultaneously. Such a view, while concentrated among people actually
in the middle of the social structure, can also be shared by those in the low status as well as
high status positions. More importantly, MARs are distinct in the depth of their feeling that
the middle class has been seriously neglected. If there is one single summation of the
MAR perspective, it is reflected in a statement which was read to respondents: The rich
give in to the demands of the poor, and the middle income people have to pay the bill.
## [538]
The  implication of  this  viewpoint is  that  there  exists  a  systematic
collusion or coalition, and perhaps a conspiracy, between the “rich” (the
powerful as well as the affluent) and the “poor” (the underclass) manifested
in managerial support for acceleration and that the victims of this collusion
are the middle income strata. While MAR ideology does not endorse the
bourgeois minimal state, it rejects the use of the state as an instrument of
amelioration and acceleration for the advancement of the underclass at the
expense and  to  the  detriment  of  the  middle class  or post-bourgeois
proletariat, and more generally it rejects the use of the state as an instrument
for social amelioration and acceleration.
Middle American Radicals see formal organizations as not holding to clear-cut rules (due
perhaps to rule-bending minorities) and as not being responsive to their concerns (due
perhaps to confused goals established by both government and minority influence). They
do not want these organizations to become smaller or to be restructured. Instead, they want
new leaders who will seek broader goals by an equal application of the rules. Out of this
desire stems a strong concern for action of some type on the part of the MAR.
## [539]
The  MAR worldview is  thus  consistent with  and  indeed is  an
articulation of  the  post-bourgeois  consciousness that  accepts the  mass
organizations of the managerial regime on which post-bourgeois groups are
materially dependent but simultaneously rejects the elite that controls and
directs these organizations, the ideology by which the elite rationalizes its
dominance, and  the  manipulative skills  and  techniques by  which the
dominance of the elite is maintained. It is also consistent with the solidarist
ideology associated with  Class  II  residues that  prevail among post-
bourgeois  strata  and  with  their  rejection of  cosmopolitan, hedonistic,
manipulative ideology and  with  their  support for  the  use  of  force  as  a

response to challenges. “To the MAR, the alliances arrayed against them are
made up of people who possess defective character traits such as laziness,
immorality or hedonistic life styles,” and
the lower middle class male defines all organizations which demand verbal skills and
organized political activity as  incompatible  with  his  self-image. His  “ideal self”  is  a
physically strong, hardworking, dependable person. Social aggressiveness and  verbal
ability are seen exclusively as feminine attributes.
## [540]
In 1975, more than 43 percent of MARs agreed with the statement that
“The true American way of life is disappearing so fast that we need to use
force to save it,” and 42 percent of these believed that force should be
directed against officials in positions of public responsibility.
## [541]
The political preferences of MARs in the mid 1970s closely paralleled
their ideological profile. Nixon and Wallace received 72 percent of MAR
votes in 1968, and in early 1972, 46 percent of MARs preferred Nixon and
Wallace to George McGovern, who received the support of only 2 percent
of MARs. About one in five among MARs “indicated that George Wallace
came  closest to  representing their  own  point  of  view.  This  level  of
identification with Wallace is significantly higher than that displayed by any
other population group in the sample,”
## [542]
and in a survey of candidate
preferences for the forthcoming 1976 presidential elections, Wallace was
favored by  51  percent of  MARs,  exceeded only  by  then-incumbent
President Gerald Ford, who was favored by 55 percent, and was followed
closely by Ronald Reagan, with 49 percent.
## [543]
Throughout the early 1970s
MARs were  significant participants in  “grassroots” protest actions and
movements, sometimes with violent fringes, that had a New Right tone: the
protest against busing for racial integration in Boston, the protest against
obscene textbooks in the West Virginia public schools, and the truckers’
strike against high fuel prices in 1973-74.

The social composition of the Wallace movement and subsequent New
Right activist campaigns and the ideology and rhetoric of Wallace himself
and his Middle American Radical constituency confirm the post-bourgeois
identity of  the  New  Right. Alienated from  bourgeois  as  well  as  from
managerial institutions and beliefs, the post-bourgeois proletariat in the late
1960s  and  early  1970s  was  beginning to  form  a  distinct consciousness,
manifested in a radical and sometimes violent political movement. This
consciousness articulated a  nascent political ideology that  expressed the
interests, aspirations, and values of the middle income strata and sharply
differentiated these strata from the underclass and the elite. The latter were
perceived as in alliance against the middle class and its values and interests
and as either unresponsive and indifferent to middle class problems—crime,
inflation, the challenges to and erosion of cultural values and institutions,
the threats to family, school, work, and neighborhood—or, through support
for continuing social amelioration and acceleration, actively collaborating
to work harm to the middle class. The acceleration of the regime in the
early  1960s  and  the  alliance between elite  and  underclass that  was
necessary for the acceleration undoubtedly was the chief precipitant of the
post-bourgeois revolt, but other precipitants included the rise of the New
Left and the counter-culture in the same period, the economic problems of
the late 1960s and early 1970s, the breakdown of order in metropolitan
areas, and the failures of American foreign policy and military action in
Indochina. While post-bourgeois political ideology remained amorphous in
many  respects and  was  often  focused on  local  issues, it  incorporated
solidarist ideas and values of group and national loyalty, postponement of
gratification, self-denial, and willingness to use force that are characteristic
of  Pareto’s  Class II  residues or  “lions,” and  it  strongly rejected and
condemned the ideas and values associated with Class I residues or “foxes”

that,  in  the  form  of cosmopolitanism and  hedonistic relativism,
characterized the ideological formula of the soft managerial elite and much
of the New Left. Although post-bourgeois ideology did not fully develop in
the early 1970s, it appeared to be evolving toward a distinct worldview that
was militant in the ends it sought and the means it was prepared to use to
achieve them, nationalist and perhaps even racialist in its affirmation of
group solidarities,  authoritarian in  its  readiness to  use  force  against
perceived enemies, and radical or even revolutionary in its aspiration to
displace the incumbent elite from social and political power and to re-order
the institutions by which the elite preserved its dominance. The evolution of
a radical anti-managerial movement composed of post-bourgeois elements
was deflected, however, by its own internal development as well as by the
assimilative response of the soft managerial regime to the challenge that
this movement presented.

The Managerial Assimilation of the Post-
## Bourgeois Resistance
Despite the clarity with which post-bourgeois forces were beginning to
announce their presence and their goals in the New Right, the movement as
it developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s began to deviate from the
radicalism and  anti-managerial  tendencies that  it  displayed in  the  early
1970s. This deviation, finally ending in the assimilation of the New Right
leadership by the managerial regime, was the result in part of changes in the
composition, objectives, and  mentality of  the  leadership of  New  Right
organizational activities and  in  part  of  an  ideological and  political
distraction of the New Right by its bourgeois conservative and Christian
evangelical allies. The  major reason, however,  for  the  managerial
assimilation of the New Right and for its failure to develop into a broad-
based, enduring, radical anti-managerial movement lay  in  the  concerted
efforts  of  the  managerial elite  itself  to  impede it.  These efforts  were
manifested by open resistance to the New Right by the managerial elite but
also  and  more  effectively by  the  co-optation and  manipulation  of  the
movement by parts of the elite in the course of the two administrations of
## Ronald Reagan.
The coalition that provided the social and political base of the Reagan
presidency contained disparate managerial and anti-managerial forces that
possessed different and  conflicting interests in  relation to  the  soft
managerial regime. On  the  one  hand, post-bourgeois  forces, largely
identical in composition to what Richard Nixon called the “New American
Majority,” provided much of Reagan’s electoral base. This constituency,

organized in  the  New  Right  movement or  sympathetic to  its  goals  and
values, lay  outside of  the  managerial elite  and  displayed considerable
hostility toward it. As Kevin Phillips describes it,
His [Reagan’s] coalition’s regional base—Sun Belt, Farm Belt and Western—coincides
with the traditional populist and antielitist component of U.S. political geography. . . .
Moreover, the coalition’s critical new religious adherents—Northern Catholic right-to-life
and  Southern fundamentalist Protestant—represent constituencies whose traditionalist
morality, over the last fifty years, has been complemented by support for the New Deal and
economic activism.
## [544]
While post-bourgeois  forces opposed the  soft  managerial  regime
because of  the  cosmopolitan and  hedonistic content of  its  ideology,  the
manipulative style  of  the  elite,  its  avoidance of  the  use  of  force,  its
encouragement of continuing acceleration and expansion of the regime in
alliance with the underclass, and its support for policies contrary to their
economic interests and cultural values, they were generally supportive of,
and  indeed materially dependent  on,  the  mass  organizations of  the
managerial state, corporations, and unions and the economic security these
structures provide. Post-bourgeois  interests thus  dictate not  the  mere
dismantlement of the regime but its transformation into a hard regime in
which Class II residues prevail within the elite and is not dependent on a
manipulative style of dominance that requires continuing acceleration and a
continuing subversion of post-bourgeois values and institutions.
The  same  post-bourgeois  forces provided the  political base  of  what
Richard Nixon called the “New American Majority.” Nixon, always aware
of  the  political significance of  post-bourgeois  forces, perceived the
possibility of basing an administration on them alone and of challenging the
managerial elite, and his apparent intention of doing so in his second term
may have contributed to the rapid alienation of his managerial allies and the
collapse of his government. “At the beginning of my second term,” Nixon

wrote in his memoirs,
Congress, the bureaucracy, and the media were still working in concert to maintain the
ideas and ideology of the traditional Eastern liberal establishment that had come down to
1973 through the New Deal, the New Frontier, and the Great Society. Now I planned to
give  expression to  the  more  conservative values and  beliefs of  the  New  Majority
throughout the  country and  use  my  power  to  put  some  teeth  into  my  New American
Revolution. As  I  noted  in  my  diary,  “This  is  going to  be  quite  a  shock to  the
establishment.”
## [545]
The “New Majority” of which Nixon wrote had “its roots mainly in the
Midwest, the  West,  and  the  South,” and  included “manual workers,
Catholics, members of labor union families, and people with only grade
school educations” who “had never before been in the Republican camp”
and “had simply never been encouraged to give the Eastern liberal elite a
run for its money for control of the nation’s key institutions.”
## [546]
## These
groups clearly include the post-bourgeois proletariat, and Nixon’s Caesarist
alliance with  them  against intermediary institutions under managerial
control was  consistent with  the  political pattern of  an  emerging  elite
challenging the rule of an incumbent minority. Some explanations of the
Watergate affair argue that the collapse of the Nixon administration was
instigated or encouraged by elements in the bureaucracy of the managerial
state  and  the  mass  media that  perceived in  Nixon’s  plans  for  “massive
reorganization and reduction of the federal bureaucracy and White House
staff”
## [547]
a direct challenge to their apparatus of power.
A second component of Reagan’s coalition, probably more hostile to the
structures of the managerial regime than post-bourgeois forces, consisted of
a relatively new stratum of entrepreneurial businessmen, located mainly in
the South and West of the United States. While new entrepreneurial forces
resembled the old bourgeoisie in that they owned and operated their own
firms, had acquired considerable wealth through the exploitation of new
technologies and markets, and often articulated an ideology of aggressive

individualism and economic growth as a rationalization of their interests
and aspirations, they lacked the connections to (and the power to dominate)
local communities that characterized the elite of the bourgeois order and
served to modify bourgeois individualism with an “ascetic” or socializing
dimension. They also were strongly opposed to the whole structure of the
managerial regime, and especially to its mass organizations in the state and
economy, as a serious obstacle to their aspirations and interests. Regulation,
bureaucracy, taxation, and labor unions represented sources of frustration to
the new entrepreneurs, who, as Sidney Blumenthal describes them,
possess neither authority endowed by  inheritance nor  authority stemming from
bureaucratic function. . . . [T]hey are envious and resentful of the Eastern Establishment,
which they equate with the Liberal Establishment. . . . Their own rise is recent, a postwar
phenomenon, and they feel excluded because of an Eastern Establishment monopoly of
prestige and political power.
## [548]
Despite their hostility to the managerial regime, their opposition was
based  largely  on  economic interests and  thus  was  in  conflict with  the
interests of post-bourgeois forces, which were economically dependent on
the regime. Nor did the aggressive individualism, probably a correlate of
Class I residues prevalent among new entrepreneurial elements, share much
with post-bourgeois solidarist values and beliefs.
The third component of Reagan’s coalition of social and political forces
consisted of those elements of the managerial elite, based mainly in the
large corporations, that sought to consolidate the regime and contain the
processes of  managerial acceleration within the  disciplines of  mass
organizations and managerial ideology. The same forces, organized since
the  early  1970s in  forums such  as  the  Trilateral Commission and  the
Business Roundtable, had supported the Carter administration in an effort to
stabilize the acceleration of the regime, assimilate anti-managerial forces
generated by acceleration, and predominate over or exclude from power

those  elements of  the  elite  involved in  “New Politics” or  New  Left
movements that  advocated forms of  acceleration and  innovation that
threatened to destabilize the managerial apparatus of power. No less than
eighteen top-ranking members of the Carter administration were members
of the Trilateral Commission, and the Carter Cabinet was overwhelmingly
managerial in composition and tone. “Without notable exception,” wrote
journalist Roger Morris of the Carter Cabinet,
they are a group of organizational aspirants and dependents, their lives defined and their
careers thrust onward by the institutional perch of the moment in government, law firm,
university,  corporation. They  are  uniformly undistinguished outside an  organizational
setting, outside the  expectations and  rewards  it  gives  them.  .  .  .  They  were  “good
managers,” Carter announced of his new Cabinet, wishing as always to be little more
himself, and knowing that it was not the meek (read outsiders), but rather the organization
men who would inherit the earth.
## [549]
Despite the managerial predominance in the Carter administration, the
effort to stabilize the regime failed, as post-bourgeois forces in the late
1970s gained increasing popular  strength in  their  resistance to  the
managerial policies of  the  administration. In  1980  corporate managerial
elements shifted their support away from Carter toward John Connally and
George Bush before supporting Reagan, who relied on a post-bourgeois,
entrepreneurial, and  anti-managerial following and  program,  after  his
nomination as Republican presidential candidate was certain.
Unlike the entrepreneurial and post-bourgeois elements in the Reagan
coalition, however,  the  managerial component had  no  interest in
dismantling the regime or in substantially altering its functioning, nor did
they seek to halt or reverse the processes of acceleration, on which their
position in  the  elite  depended. They  sought rather to  manage and
manipulate acceleration within the existing framework and disciplines of
managerial organizations in  the  state,  economy,  and  culture. The  chief
executive officers of the corporations of the Business Roundtable, writes

## Blumenthal,
have not risen to their positions because of Yankee ingenuity, chance, or celebrity. With the
growth of a national market and the rapid pace of technological development in the late
nineteenth century, the corporations expanded and diversified. They required technical
expertise, a complex hierarchical system, internal stability, and a permanent managerial
elite.
## [550]
Although the managerial forces that joined Reagan’s coalition had an
interest in  controlling inflation  and  reducing the  impact of  federal
regulation and  taxation on  the  corporate sector,  they  were  principally
interested in preserving the managerial state and its close relationship with
the  mass  economic organizations and  in  ensuring that  this  relationship
functioned efficiently.
They [the CEO’s] want big government to be the marketing agency and brokerage firm to
big business. The CEOs appreciate the methods of big government, when they serve their
interests, because they seem so similar to those of big business. What they always want
from big government is faster service and preferential treatment. They believe government
should be run like a subsidiary. So they think of reforming government, not eliminating it.
## [551]
In the early 1970s, managerial stabilization required the assimilation of
the New Left, and this was achieved by drawing the adherents of the New
Left into the political routines and disciplines of the mass organizations of
the managerial state and the structures of culture and communication. By
the  late  1970s and  early  1980s,  managerial stabilization required the
assimilation of  the  New  Right  and  the  neutralization of  anti-managerial
demands that emerged from post-bourgeois and new entrepreneurial forces
that  challenged the  managerial apparatus of  power.  This  process of
assimilation took place in the course of the Reagan presidency.
The  principal ideological vehicle for  this  assimilation was  the
intellectual and  political movement that  came to  be  known as
“neoconservatism.” Although this movement was generally associated with

a  comparatively small  group of  intellectuals, journalists, and  social
scientists drawn  from  the  managerial intelligentsia and  located in  the
northeastern, urban  universities and  media, it  eventually acquired close
connections to the corporate managerial elite and allied with it in the effort
to  consolidate  and  stabilize the  regime. The  body  of  intellectuals and
verbalists that  constituted the  neoconservative movement was  not  only
drawn from the managerial intelligentsia but also was composed largely of
academics and publicists who had been among the principal architects and
exponents of the consensus liberalism that had served as the ideological
orthodoxy of the managerial regime in the period of consolidation. The
acceleration of  the  regime, releasing forces that  challenged managerial
power and ideology in the state, corporation, and mass media, threatened
the positions, interests, beliefs, and achievements of those in the managerial
intellectual and  verbalist professions who  had  formulated  consensus
liberalism; and the articulation of neoconservatism was a response to these
challenges and  an  attempt to  resolve the  crisis  of  the  regime that
acceleration had generated.
The principal source of pressures for further acceleration, often in forms
that would have been dysfunctional to the stability of the regime and the
power of the elite, was an element of the managerial elite located mainly in
the managerial bureaucracy and the mass media that came to be labeled (at
least  by  neoconservatives) as  the  “New  Class.”  This  element, in  many
respects derived  from  or  sympathetic to  the  New  Left  of  the  1960s,
advocated or encouraged a continuing acceleration of social and political
change directed especially against bourgeois remnants in the managerial
regime but also against the institutionalized apparatus and disciplines of the
regime itself. The “New Class” used its positions in the managerial state
and mass organizations of culture and communication, both of which had

expanded dramatically in the Great Society programs and the advances in
communications technology and services in the period of acceleration of the
1960s, to challenge the balance of power within the elite and to seek to
dominate and  restructure the  corporate sector and  the  national security
bureaucracy of the state, and it sought to ally with the underclass and with
marginal  minorities to  form  a  political base  for  the  advancement of  its
power. In the 1970s and 1980s it was the source of the “New Politics,”
associated with the campaigns of George McGovern, Walter Mondale, Gary
Hart,  and Jesse  Jackson, among others, and  though it  often  used  an
ostensibly anti-managerial rhetoric critical of technology and bureaucracy,
it depended on them for its political movements and its own status and
rewards within the regime. Rejecting most of the managerial consensus that
had  eroded in  the  1960s and  1970s, it  retained both  the  progressivist
elements of  managerial liberalism as  well  as  the  basic  interests of  the
managerial elite, into which it had been assimilated, and aspired to become
the dominant component of the elite.
Although neoconservative polemics often identified the “New Class” as
an  enemy,  dedicated to  continuing acceleration and  destabilization, the
exponents of neoconservatism were themselves closely related to the “New
Class,” which was simply a component of the managerial elite. “Despite the
polemics, exaggeration, and confusion surrounding the term,” writes Peter
Steinfels, “those who use it agree on certain characteristics.”
First, the “new class” derives its power from two very different sources: from, on the one
hand, “expertise”—technical knowledge and skills, often of a fairly advanced sort—and,
on  the  other  hand,  from  “position”—posts  in  large,  complex organizations that  both
depend on the expertise of the “new class” and provide the necessary conditions for its
exercise. Second, the  “new  class” acquires  its  advanced education and  achieves  its
positions, at least to begin with, through higher education and the credentials thereby
earned.
## [552]
The process of acceleration and the challenge to consensus liberalism

from the New Left and counterculture had disrupted and in many respects
discredited the operative political formula of the managerial regime, and the
ensuing crisis of the regime could not be resolved adequately until a new
ideological consensus had  been  formulated that  would unify  the  elite.
Neoconservatism emerged as such an ideological formula intended to unify
the elite as consensus liberalism had unified it in the period of consolidation
and to resolve the crisis provoked by acceleration.
What  the  “new  class”  needs, quite  simply,  is  ideology—a large  and  coherent set  of
principles and symbols that will ground and guide its politics. From the neoconservative
viewpoint, this ideology must integrate the restless “new class” firmly into “the system.”
In  sum,  the  ideological offensive of  neoconservatism has  two  purposes. One,  fairly
conscious, is  to  bind  the  “new  class” to  the  institutions of  liberal [i.e.,  managerial]
capitalism, thus assuring that system’s stability and survival. The second, less conscious, is
to ensure the leadership of the policy professionals in the “new class” and their influential
position near the pinnacles of power.
## [553]
Although neoconservative formulas were  directed at  the  “new  class”
component of the managerial elite, they were far more attractive to both the
corporate managerial elements in  the  Reagan coalition and  to  the  new
leadership that emerged within the New Right movement in the late 1970s
and early 1980s than either traditional bourgeois conservatism or the radical
anti-managerial and conflict-oriented ideas of post-bourgeois forces. Like
the corporate sector of the managerial elite, neoconservatism did not seek to
dismantle the mass organizations of the regime, as did the conservatism of
bourgeois  forces, or  to  halt  its  dynamic of  acceleration, as  did  post-
bourgeois  forces. Neoconservatism sought to  reform and  stabilize the
functioning of  mass  organizations and  to  provide a  new  legitimizing
consensus for the regime that would include both the “New Class” and the
post-bourgeois  resistance and  to  legitimize continuous but  managed
acceleration of the regime. Paul H. Weaver has noted the close relationship
between neoconservatism and  the  interests of  the  managerial corporate

system.
Neoconservatives believe in  institutions, prudential management of  society’s  affairs,
experts, social policy, a well-tempered welfare state, and the idea of the corporation as a
quasi-public institution. They reject as simplistic the principles of limited government,
individual rights, direct citizen participation, and the marketplace. The corporation . . .
stood for these same neoconservative ideals. In effect, the company was a laboratory for
the study of neoconservative theory.
## [554]
In  short,  neoconservatism was  a  form  of  managerial conservatism,
distinct from and opposed to the goals of the anti-managerial ideologies of
both bourgeois and post-bourgeois groups, that was an adaptation of the
managerial liberalism that served as the consensus ideology of the regime in
the period of consolidation.
Thus, Irving Kristol, often called the “godfather” of neoconservatism,
while highly critical of the erosion of bourgeois “republican morality” and
the cultural effects of the “corporate revolution” in American capitalism,
endorsed what he called a “conservative welfare state”
## [555]
and argued that
In  economic  and  social  policy,  it  [neoconservatism] feels  no  lingering hostility to  the
welfare state, nor does it accept it resignedly, as a necessary evil. Instead it seeks not to
dismantle the welfare state in the name of free-market economics but rather to reshape it so
as  to  attach to  it  the conservative  predispositions  of  the  people. This  reshaping will
presumably take the form of trying to rid the welfare state of its paternalistic orientation,
imposed on it by Left-liberalism, and making it over into the kind of “social insurance
state” that provides the social and economic security a modern citizenry demands while
minimizing governmental intrusion into individual liberties.
## [556]
Similarly, John Podhoretz, son of neoconservative publicists Norman
Podhoretz and Midge Decter and himself a representative neoconservative
voice, wrote that
To be conservative in the 1970s meant to conserve not only basic moral and political
views, but also programs like the New Deal that had become part of the American political
fabric. The conservative decision to stop warring against the New Deal was one of the
most important developments in the mass acceptance of Ronald Reagan.
## [557]
Neoconservatism thus did not challenge the fusion of state and economy

that the New Deal and welfare state symbolized and created, and which was
the central organizational relationship of the managerial regime. It called
for a reform or “reshaping” of the fused apparatus and for the evolution of
what Kristol called “a set of values and a conception of democracy that can
function as the equivalent of the republican morality of yesteryear.”
## [558]
## A
common label  for  the  political-economic order  that  neoconservatives
articulated was “democratic capitalism,” in which the interdependence of
state and corporation was maintained. As neoconservative Michael Novak
described it,
Thus the full nature of the system of democratic capitalism—and of its natural child, the
large  mass-manufacturing firm—has become visible to  the  world. Transnational
companies are not economic systems only. . . . They require intimate contact with the
political system and with the moral-cultural system of host nations.
In some respects, transnationals are utterly dependent upon governments; in some respects
their relations are symbiotic and in others their power may suborn those of governments.
Transnationals are clearly involved as political agents functioning within political systems.
. . . There is nothing wrong with this need for harmony between the economic system and
the  political  system;  it  is  wholly natural. Socialist societies solve  it  by  subordinating
economics to politics. The preferred democratic capitalist solution is coordination.
## [559]
Nor did the foreign policy prescriptions articulated by neoconservatives
alienate the  corporate managerial elite.  Neoconservatism rejected the
isolationism and “rollback” policies advocated by bourgeois conservative
anti-communists and defended both the apparatus and the basic ideological
presuppositions of managerial globalism as it had developed in the era of
managerial consolidation. Like  the  architects of  the  containment policy,
they formulated an internationalist policy in terms of “national interest” and
sharply distinguished their idea of national interest from that of isolationist
and bourgeois concepts. Neoconservatives, wrote Kristol,
believe that the goals of American foreign policy must go beyond a narrow, too literal
definition of “national security.” It is the national interest of a world power, as this is
defined by a sense of national destiny, that American foreign policy is about, not a myopic
national security.
## [560]

The concept of “national interest” was embedded in a neoconservative
journal of that title, with Kristol as publisher and with the neoconservative
former ambassador to the United Nations Jeane J. Kirkpatrick and former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as members of its editorial advisory
board. The journal’s co-editor, Robert Tucker, articulated a view of foreign
policy as  the  pragmatic pursuit of  national interests apart  from  abstract
moral ideals—“The proper object of foreign policy cannot be the pursuit of
freedom in  general. The  first  charge  must  be  a  more  narrowly  defined
interest of the nation, and secondly must be the defense of one’s friends and
allies who are basically in accord with our outlook and institutions”—and
this view was reinforced by Owen Harries, also co-editor of the journal,
who  described himself and  his  colleague as  “both  sort  of  realpolitik
chaps,”
## [561]
and by Kirkpatrick, who expressed much the same view:
Americans are hard-headed and pragmatic in relation to domestic policy and politics, but
we have tended to see foreign affairs as a kind of domain for utopianism, for universalism,
rather than the protection of national interests. American foreign policy has long tended to
suffer from an inadequate conception of our national interests. I believe very deeply that
the national interest should be the center of gravity of our foreign policy.
## [562]
Despite these invocations of the national interest and realpolitik and the
rejection of moralism, utopianism, and universalism, the actual content of
the  “national interest” as  neoconservatives perceived it  reflected the
cosmopolitan and meliorist premises of managerial liberalism. As Kristol
wrote in The National Interest in 1987,
Realpolitik à la Disraeli is unthinkable in America, since it runs against
the very grain of our political ethos. Ours is a nation based on a universal
creed, and  there  is  an  unquenchable missionary element in  our  foreign
policy. We do aim to “make the world safe for democracy”—eventually,
and in those places and at those times where conditions permit democracy
to flourish. Every American administration in our history has felt compelled

—though some  have  been  more  enthusiastic than  others—to use  our
influence, wherever possible, to  see  that  other  governments  repeat our
conception of individual rights as the foundation of a just regime and a
good society.
## [563]
The globalist content of neoconservative foreign policy in the 1980s
consisted mainly in preserving and extending the international free trade
system favored by the managerial elite throughout most of the 20th century
and  in  encouraging the  economic  and  political development (under the
formula of  “democratization”) of  Third  World  states. The  latter  policy,
implemented principally by the National Endowment for Democracy and
the  Bureau of  Human Rights and  Humanitarian Affairs  in  the  State
Department, sought to accomplish the same kind of global assimilation of
underdeveloped regions within a transnational managerial framework that
foreign aid programs of the 1950s and 1960s had envisioned. Both these
agencies were  under  neoconservative influence throughout most  of  the
Reagan presidency.
Although neoconservatives gained a reputation for strong advocacy of
the use of force in international affairs, especially against communist or
anti-American movements and regimes in the Third World, the direct use of
U.S. military force in the 1980s was minimal, and neoconservative policy-
makers were  influential in  providing U.S.  support to  centrist or  liberal
elements in El Salvador, the Philippines, and Haiti and in creating pressures
for  democratization  and  greater observance of  “human rights” in  South
Africa and  Chile. The  anti-communism espoused by  neoconservatives
generally incorporated the ideas of consensus liberalism on minimizing the
use of force, relying on manipulation and its institutionalized forms in mass
organizations and  managerial skills  to  deal  with  global problems, and

applying these skills to the amelioration of social, economic, and political
environments that contributed to Marxist and anti-western movements.
One  of  the  principal documents of  the  Reagan era  that  exhibited
neoconservative and  managerial assumptions in  foreign policy was  the
Report of the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America, issued
in January, 1984. The report was the work of a presidentially appointed
panel under the chairmanship of Henry Kissinger, but its conclusions were
strongly influenced by neoconservative Jeane Kirkpatrick, who served as a
consultant to the panel. While the report recognized the role of foreign
military intervention  and  subversion by  Cuba  and  the  Soviet Union in
instigating insurgencies in Central America, it emphasized that “poverty,
repression, inequity, all were there; stirring in a world recession created a
potent witch’s brew, while outside forces have intervened to exacerbate the
area’s troubles and to exploit its anguish.”
## [564]
The Report recommended far-
ranging social, economic, and  political reforms in  Central America that
would promote “democratization, economic growth, human development
and security” and would have effectively revolutionized Central American
societies and governments while assimilating them more firmly within the
transnational managerial regime through the  development of  local
managerial elites in the economy, governments, and educational institutions
of  the  region, the  elimination  of  traditional elites  by  land  reform and
democratization, and the inculcation of the ideological premises and goals
of managerial globalism in the new elites.
The social and cultural ideas of neoconservatism also conformed to the
interests of the managerial elite and replicated in modified form the idea of
a “pluralistic consensus” associated with the managerial liberalism of the
period of consolidation in the 1950s and 1960s. “If one did not know,”

wrote neoconservative religious critic Richard John Neuhaus, “that [Arthur
M. Schlesinger, Jr.’s] The Vital Center was written thirty-five years ago, she
would suspect it  was  written by  one  of  those  who  today  are  called
neoconservatives. It is a curiosity of our time that the mainstream liberalism
of  a  few  decades ago  .  .  .  is  the  neo-conservatism of  today.”
## [565]
## While
neoconservatism offered formal defenses of institutions such as the family,
community,  public religion and  morality,  and  traditional schooling, the
actual content of  its  social and  cultural theory tended to  legitimize
managerial control of the processes of socialization and the mechanisms of
continuing but  managed acceleration. Describing how  the  “multiple
pluralisms of daily life have their origin in a sturdy triune framework—in
the division of the political system from the moral-cultural system, and of
the economic system from both,” Michael Novak argued that “From the
stream of  sparks flowing from  their  contact it  [the  “pluralist  system”]
derives its energy for progress and its capacities for internal correction. It is
a system intended to constitute a continuous revolution.”
## [566]
## Irving Kristol,
while affirming that “Neoconservatives look upon family and religion as
indispensable pillars of a decent society,” argued that the neoconservative
perspective was consistent with
a state that takes a degree of responsibility for helping to shape the preferences that the
people exercise in  a  free  market—to “elevate” them,  if  you  will.  Neoconservatives,
moreover, believe that it is natural for people to want their preferences to be elevated. The
current version of liberalism, which prescribes massive government intervention in the
marketplace but  an  absolute laissez-faire attitude toward manners and  morals, strikes
neoconservatives as representing a bizarre inversion of priorities.
## [567]
The  “shaping” or  “elevation” of  preferences by  the  managerial  state
served to  rationalize the  managerial manipulation of  the  “continuous
revolution” engendered by the “pluralist system,” that consisted of the fused
and interdependent mass organizations in state, economy, and culture and
communication. “Pluralism” in neoconservative theory thus resembled the

“equilibrium” of  the  consensus liberalism of  the  1950s, which also
postulated a  balance among supposedly separate and  mutually checking
(but actually fused and mutually reinforcing) mass organizations, and, also
like  the  “pluralistic consensus” of  the  period of  consolidation,
neoconservative pluralism excluded those social and political forces and
products of acceleration that challenged the regime, particularly the post-
bourgeois  political  movements. Thus,  Richard John  Neuhaus recognized
that the militant fundamentalists of the Christian Right “are making the
most aggressive bid to become the new culture-forming elite in America,”
but frankly stated, “I do not think they will succeed. I hope not.”
## [568]
## The
Christian Right, in Neuhaus’s view, was incompatible with the “democratic
discourse” and  “public ethic” that  he  and  other  neoconservatives were
seeking to formulate as the new consensus that would stabilize the regime
and unify its elite as well as the social and political forces opposed to it.
Neoconservatism, then, did not challenge the dynamic of the managerial
regime by which continuing social and cultural innovation takes place, but
it did seek to re-legitimize those structures and disciplines of the regime by
which the  processes of  continuous innovation are  manipulated and
managed. For neoconservatives, unlike the managerial liberals of the period
of emergence and the period of consolidation, the preferred instruments of
this managed acceleration were the institutions of “democratic capitalism,”
rather than  the  managerial state, though the  state  continued in
neoconservative thought to  play  an  important disciplining function; but
since the problem was one of continuing and controlling the processes of
managed acceleration rather than of initiating them, these were instruments
suitable to  the  purpose. Neoconservative William  Bennett, Secretary of
Education in the second Reagan administration, defended the teaching of
“traditional values” in  the  educational system, but  he  and  his

neoconservative colleagues did nothing to reduce the role of the managerial
state itself in education and in fact did much to extend and perpetuate it.
Neoconservatives generally defended the extension of the Voting Rights Act
in 1982, the establishment of a federal public holiday for Martin Luther
King,  Jr.  in  1983,  the  abolition or  reduction of  restrictions on  foreign
immigration, and the elimination of traditional social, economic, regional,
sexual, and racial identities and relationships that impeded the evolution,
through managed acceleration, of a mobile, cosmopolitan, technologically
driven culture unified by its pursuit of mass consumption and dispossessed
of  distinct  cultural and  national identity.  Perhaps one  of  the  clearest
statements of this social vision was offered by George Gilder, a principal
spokesman for  neoconservative  social  and  economic ideas,  in  the  lead
article in  the  20th-anniversary issue  of The  American Spectator.  “An
onslaught of technological progress,” wrote Gilder, “was reducing much of
economic and social theory to gibberish. . . . [S]uch concepts as land, labor,
and capital, nation and society . . . have radically different meanings than
before and drastically different values.”
The worldwide network of satellites and fiber optic cables, linked to digital computers,
television terminals, telephones and databases, sustain worldwide markets for information,
currency and capital on line 24 hours a day. Boeing 747s constantly traversing the oceans
foster a global community of commerce. The silicon in sand and glass forms a global
ganglion of electronic and photonic media that leaves all history in its wake. With other
new technologies of materials science, bioengineering, robotics, and superconductivity, all
also heavily dependent on the microchip, informations systems are radically reducing the
significance of  so-called raw  materials and  natural endowments, nations and  ethnic
loyalties, material totems and localities.
But nations are not separate, and short of a worldwide retreat to a pre-electronic age, trade
will never balance again. The U.S., like all other countries, will again be “independent”
only if it is willing to be poor. . . .
Listening to the technology opens us to a new sense of the music of the spheres, a new
sense of the power of ideas, a new integrated vision of the future of humanity. . . . It is the
authentic frontier, invisible and invigorating, and closer to the foundation of reality and the
reality of God.
## [569]

Gilder thus  recapitulated the  scientistic, cosmopolitan, hedonist, and
meliorist or actually utopian premises of managerial liberalism, but he did
so under the new formulas of “democratic capitalism” and technological
manipulation of  social, economic, and  political environments that
apparently differentiated the  new  vehicle of  neoconservatism from  the
vehicle that had served in the period of managerial emergence.
Neoconservatism thus did not challenge the structure or functioning of
the soft managerial regime in any significant respect and in fact provided
adapted rationalizations for the regime and the interests of its elite, and its
exponents and architects were able to cement an alliance with elements of
the  corporate managerial elite  that  sought a  means of  stabilizing and
consolidating the  regime and  of  continuing managed acceleration while
avoiding any  far-reaching structural change in  its  institutional
arrangements. The  alliance between the  corporate managerial elite  and
neoconservative intellectuals and verbalists was  the  result  of  a  growing
awareness by  the  elite  of  its  need  to  manipulate public policies and
dominant orthodoxies more effectively than was possible operating on the
basis of a managerial liberal consensus that had virtually dissipated by the
late 1970s. As Sidney Blumenthal notes,
Until  the  mid-1970s the  corporate managers had  been  indifferent, at  best,  to  the
conservative intellectuals. They  felt  they  had  little  need  for  abstract and  ideological
theoreticians. . . .
With  the  growth of  the  federal bureaucracy,  accelerating even  under Republican
presidents, and the threat of economic stagnation, the corporate managers suddenly began
paying attention. The increasingly technical notion of economic production had compelled
elaborate planning of  operations and  consumer desire. Now  the  most  advanced chief
executive officers  realized that  policy must  be  influenced to  make  their  planning
successful. Economic development depends  upon  the  ability to  marshal resources,
including the  resources of  ideas  and  persuasion. .  .  .  Corporate managers became
convinced, upon  hearing the  conservatives  tell  them,  that  they  needed to  support  an
intelligentsia to advance their goals.
## [570]

From  the  late  1970s major  corporate and  foundation donors began
contributing large  amounts of  funds to  projects designed by
neoconservative activists. Thus, the  John  M.  Olin  Foundation began
funding academic chairs “in economics, law and other social sciences at
more  than  a  dozen  universities and  think  tanks” for  neoconservative
occupants, and  in  1978,  with  other  tax-exempt institutions—the Sarah
Scaife, Smith Richardson, and J.M. foundations—it established the Institute
for  Educational  Affairs  (IEA), which acted  as  a  clearinghouse for
neoconservative projects, under the direction of Irving Kristol and former
Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon. The IEA provided funds for a
neoconservative journal, This  World, one of whose editors was Michael
Novak. The Olin Foundation provided funds for The National Interest, and
its co-editor, Owen Harries, received a fellowship from the foundation the
year before the establishment of the journal. Kristol himself held a chair at
New  York  University endowed  by  the  Olin  Foundation. The  Smith
Richardson Foundation financed  Jeane  Kirkpatrick’s  research on  Latin
America and made her a member of its board and also provided funding for
Michael Novak’s The  Spirit of  Democratic Capitalism;  and  other
foundations that formed IEA also contributed large amounts of funds for
similar neoconservative activities. There was a close connection between
the  managers of  these  foundations and  the  neoconservative movement.
Businessman Robert Krieble, president of the Loctite Corporation and a
member of the board of IEA, remarked that “business is slowly coming to
realize that the long-term success of their companies depends just as much
on social policy as on management. Think tanks are useful tools.”
## [571]
The  alliance between corporate  managerial and  neoconservative
ideological forces, and the dominance of their alliance within the Reagan
coalition, was further advanced by the decline of contributions to political

causes by the bourgeois, post-bourgeois, and new entrepreneurial elements
in  the  coalition. Although solicitation of  large  amounts of  funds  from
“grassroots” sources largely outside and hostile to the managerial regime
had  been  successful in  the  1970s  through direct  mail  fund-raising in
mobilizing a serious political challenge to the regime, by the mid 1980s
these sources were declining in the level of their financial commitments.
The  leading activist organizations of  the  New  Right—the National
Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC),  the  Conservative
Caucus, the  Free  Congress PAC,  the  Conservative Victory Fund—all
suffered from declining income and reduced operations, and contributions
to  NCPAC,  the  Fund for  a  Conservative Majority,  the  National
Congressional Club, and the Free Congress PAC declined from a total of
$32 million in 1983 and 1984 to $20.8 million in 1985 and 1986. Richard
Viguerie and other direct mail consultants to New Right causes also lost
income. Viguerie himself was  forced to  sell  his  New  Right-oriented
magazine Conservative Digest in 1985, and he relied increasingly on non-
ideological and commercial fund-raising, which rose from 10 to 60 percent
of  his  business. Christian evangelical organizations, perhaps the  most
successful and  important vehicles  for  the  mobilization of  New  Right
political causes in the 1970s, also lost income in the same period. The Rev.
Jerry Falwell laid off more than 200 workers in 1986 and withdrew from
politics in  the  following year,  while  the  Rev. Pat  Robertson’s  Christian
Broadcasting Network reduced its budget in 1986 by $24 million in 1986
and $9 million in 1987. In the latter year, financial donations to the Oral
Roberts ministry declined by  40  percent, while  financial support for
Falwell’s and Robertson’s television ministries fell by 60 percent and 32
percent respectively, and contributions to New Right political organizations
also continued to decline.
## [572]

Financial support for  New  Right  causes from  new  entrepreneurial
sources in the South and West also began to diminish. The Washington Post
reported in  1986  that  whereas  in  1981,  nearly 25  percent of  financial
donations to the Republican National Committee originated from centers of
new entrepreneurial wealth in Texas and Oklahoma and only 13.6 percent
from New York City and its suburbs, by 1985 contributions from the two
southwestern oil  states  had  fallen  to  16.1  percent of  the  RNC’s  large
donations, and the New York City region and Massachusetts had increased
their share to 19.1 percent. “The geographic shift from the Southwest to the
Northeast,” commented The Post,
has substantially changed the character of the GOP’s major donor base. The number of
men who achieved sudden and massive wealth in the oil boom of the late 1970s and who
saw political contributions as a kind of wildcatting investment in conservatism has been
sharply reduced.
They  have  been  replaced, in  large  part,  by  more  establishment-type
donors, the kind of financial supporters who have been associated with the
old guard, traditional wing of the Republican Party dating to the days of
Thomas E. Dewey and Dwight D. Eisenhower. . . .
The key organizers of the RNC’s 1986 dinner were not cowboy oil men but a group of men
and women with strong ties to the Ivy League and who run or serve on the boards of
corporate giants.
## [573]
The early and mid 1980s thus witnessed a significant shift in the power
of  the  social  forces within the  Reagan coalition, a  shift  that, The  Post
commented, “could have  long  range  ideological consequences” and  “is
likely to undermine the continuing strength of the conservative movement
in the United States.”
## [574]
Although the demographic and financial resources
of  bourgeois, post-bourgeois, and  new  entrepreneurial elements (all  of
which harbored anti-managerial ideas  and  interests) had  been  largely
responsible for  Reagan’s  electoral victory,  the  force  that  soon  came  to

predominate within the  Reagan administration and  the  ideological and
political organizations associated with it was the corporate managerial elite
and its neoconservative ideological vanguard, both of which were based in
or drawn from the northeastern urbanized centers of the soft managerial
regime and  both  of  which reflected the  interests and  values  of  the
managerial elite.
Various reasons account for  the  decline of  New  and  Christian Right
political organizations—the exhaustion of direct mail fund-raising lists, the
fall of oil prices in the mid 1980s and the resultant economic recession in
the South and West, the decline of inflation and tax rates and the consequent
disappearance of two of the main economic precipitants of post-bourgeois
activism, and  the  success of  the  Reagan presidency in  reducing post-
bourgeois polarization. An additional reason may lie in the differentiation
that emerged between the leadership and preoccupations of the New Right
political movement on the one hand and the demographic composition of its
mass  base,  on  the  other.  While the  mass  following of  the  New  Right
remained post-bourgeois  and  anti-managerial in  its  values,  interests,
aspirations, and beliefs, and exhibited the psychic and behavioral patterns
associated with Class II residues, the elite that emerged within the New
Right  increasingly  resembled and  was  drawn from  the  managerial  elite
itself. Neoconservative ideological formulas appealed to the leadership of
the New Right far more than the militant, confrontational, anti-managerial
formulas and reflexes of the post-bourgeois strata, and the emergence of a
managerial elite within the New Right itself was a principal reason for the
assimilation of the movement by the soft managerial regime and perhaps for
the  alienation of  the  post-bourgeois  base  of  the  New  Right  from  its
leadership.

The reliance by the New Right on computerized direct mail fundraising
and  other  technologically advanced communications and  organizational
devices drew into the movement, in leadership positions, elements derived
from  or  susceptible to  influence by  the  managerial elite.  While these
techniques were indispensable to the New Right in mobilizing the financial
and  political  base  of  the  movement, expertise in  them  was  largely
concentrated in  the  urban  conglomerations of  the  northeastern United
States, where managerial power and cultural influence were concentrated,
and reliance on these skills tended to differentiate the New Right leadership
from  its  mass  base  and  contributed to  the  eventual decapitation and
assimilation of what was originally a radical anti-managerial movement.
The  new  leadership of  the  New  Right  was  part  of  a  larger  social
formation within the managerial elite that came to be known as “Young,
Upwardly Mobile Professionals.” “Yuppies,” distinguished by their youth
(born between 1945 and 1960) and by their possession of an annual income
of $40,000 or more from a professional or managerial job, consisted of
some 4 million citizens in the mid 1980s, typically residing and working in
major urban and suburban areas. While they derived their income, status,
and power from the application of technical and managerial skills in mass
organizations, they were also distinguished by their loose bonds with these
organizations and by their intensely cosmopolitan and hedonistic life-styles
and aspirations. Although young, upwardly mobile professionals were often
active in  New  Politics causes and  were  especially attracted to  the
presidential campaign of Senator Gary Hart in 1984, in the same year 34
percent of Democratic voters who supported Hart in the primaries voted for
Reagan in  the  general election. “With  the Yuppies in  tow,”  commented
## Newsweek,
the Republican Party might achieve its long-sought realignment of the political system.

Without the Yuppies, the Democrats may not regain the presidency in this era. As the most
visible part of the demographic bulge known as the baby boom, Yuppies are likely, says
Republican consultant Lee Atwater, to become “the dominant political group well on into
the next century.”
## [575]
It was from this stratum that the professional echelon of the New Right
and neoconservative organizations, largely centered in Washington, were
drawn. Describing this echelon in The Washington Post “Style” section in
1985,  reporter James Conaway characterized them  as  “ambitious, right-
wardly mobile and powerful.”
They socialize at meetings and receptions and concerts (classical, not rock). They drink
scotch instead of smoking pot. They rarely sleep together and don’t talk about it if they do.
“The  trend,”  says  another,  “is  toward elegance, class  and  civilization, rather than
marijuana, guitars and lumberjack shirts.
“It’s boring,” he adds, “to be a proletarian.”
## [576]
The  members of  this  echelon and  of  the  Yuppie  component  of  the
managerial elite  in  general, were  well-educated (often at  Ivy  League
universities), managerially and  technically skilled, affluent, and
cosmopolitan in their tastes, values, and life-styles. “We like movies, and
dancing,” one of them told Conaway. “We do liberal things, like drinking at
the Third Edition [a fashionable Georgetown bar].”
## [577]
They thus differed
radically in cultural and behavioral style from the blue collar workers and
lower middle class core of the post-bourgeois proletariat that formed the
mass base of the New Right political movement, and as Newsweek noted of
the political ideology of Yuppies:
It is by now almost a cliché that Yuppie ideology juxtaposes economic
conservatism with liberalism on social issues like abortion and homosexual
rights. With  their  newfound stake  in  the  economy,  Yuppies cringe at
government regulation of markets; many embrace the entrepreneurial creed
of no riches without risk. But they welcome government intervention in

such  areas  as  environmental management, or discrimination against
minorities. At bottom, one issue animates them: quality of life, others’ as
well as their own.
## [578]
Yuppie  economic aspirations thus  implied a  skepticism toward some
aspects of the managerial regime, especially the economic regulatory role of
the managerial state, and in this respect resembled the attitudes of new
entrepreneurial forces, though their  aspirations and  interests were  also
compatible with  neoconservative  managerial formulas. Their  ideological
proclivities were directly opposed to those of the post-bourgeois proletariat,
however. The latter is wedded to the mass organizations of the state and
economy and  the  economic security they  provide, but  rejects the
manipulative technique and  styles  of  dominance and  the  hedonistic and
cosmopolitan ethic of managerial ideology, while Yuppies reject or express
indifference to  the  solidarist and  disciplinary institutions and  values
prominent in  post-bourgeois  consciousness and  seek  to  modify the
regulatory and paternalistic functions of the managerial state on which post-
bourgeois forces are economically dependent. Although the new leadership
of the New Right organizations did not go so far in the mid 1980s as to
reject solidarist values explicitly, it did display a tendency to de-emphasize
or transmute them. Its patriotic and nationalist sentiments were expressed
largely through support of technologically intensive military programs such
as the Strategic Defense Initiative, the vicarious use of force by U.S.-funded
anti-communist resistance movements, and patronage of films produced by
the  entertainment sector of  the  mass  media that  celebrated the  martial
virtues, but it seldom pressed for direct and long-term use of force against
foreign or  domestic threats. Its  affirmation of  solidarist institutions and
values such as family, religion, public morality, community, and national
identity was largely formal and cerebral, and it rejected almost categorically

any affirmation of class, sexual, and racial identity.
## [579]
In addition to the infusion of managerial elements into the New Right
leadership, the assimilation of the movement was also facilitated by the still
primitive and generally amorphous level of post-bourgeois consciousness
and  by  support for  the  New  Right  from  bourgeois  conservative, new
entrepreneurial, and Christian activist ideological and political groups. As
New Right activism gained popular support, these groups began to attach
themselves and to impart their own ideological preferences and political
agendas to  it,  and  their  concerns  differed  significantly those  of  post-
bourgeois strata.
The ideological distortion of post-bourgeois consciousness that occurred
in the 1970s and 1980s is in some respects analogous to the phenomenon
Oswald Spengler called “pseudomorphosis”—the adaptation of the styles of
an older culture by a younger one, with the effect of distorting its historical
maturation—that also took place with the bourgeois and managerial elites
as  they  emerged  as  ruling minorities, and  it  is  also  similar  to  the
phenomenon Marxists describe as  “false  consciousness.” Thus,  although
post-bourgeois  strata  began to  perceive common interests, goals, and
enemies, they were unable to formulate a coherent ideology that unified
them as an emerging elite, rationalized their interests and aspirations, and
distinguished them from bourgeois and managerial groups. Post-bourgeois
elements generally  lacked the  educational training and  verbal skills  to
articulate such an ideology, and the mutual hostility between them and the
managerial intelligentsia prevented the latter from forming any connections
with them. Authoritarian and extreme nationalist ideologies have been rare
in  American  political and  intellectual history and  were  not  readily
accessible to post-bourgeois activists. The ideological vacuum that existed

among post-bourgeois forces was therefore filled by a variety of formulas,
none of which provided a reasonably accurate analysis of their position and
interests and many of which were themselves pathological, eccentric, or
useful for  only  limited tactical goals—conspiracy theories, racial
ideologies, nostalgic indulgences, occultist and pseudo-scientific doctrines,
and the like. While such currents were sometimes useful for mobilizing
post-bourgeois  elements, they  were  incapable of  sustaining an  enduring
social  and  political movement  aspiring to  challenge and  transform the
managerial regime.
In lieu of a coherent and distinctive post-bourgeois ideology, the New
Right adapted and made use of forms of Old Right bourgeois conservatism
and the fundamentalism of the New Christian Right. The former exerted
little appeal to post-bourgeois working class elements, however, since it
entertained the idea of abolishing or seriously limiting the economic role of
the state, restraining the power of labor unions, and restoring the institutions
of the bourgeois order—the minimal, neutralist state, laissez-faire economic
theory, a strict constitutionalism that reflected the interests of the bourgeois
elite in reducing and controlling the size and power of government, and a
foreign policy preoccupied with world communism. Opposition to federal
regulation of  business, for  example, attracted bourgeois  conservatives
wedded to laissez-faire  economic theory as  well  as  new  entrepreneurial
elements that felt threatened by such regulation, but it did little to attract or
consolidate working class MARs. Post-bourgeois  forces were  generally
opposed or indifferent to these bourgeois and entrepreneurial concerns, and
the  adaptation of  bourgeois  conservatism for  post-bourgeois  New  Right
purposes did  little  to  advance,  and  much  to  retard and  deflect, the
distinctive identity of  the post-bourgeois  proletariat or  to  expand or
integrate it as a distinctive social and political force.

The infusion of Christian fundamentalism into New Right efforts also
served to  deflect their  incipient  radicalism and  to  invest them  with  an
essentially conservative religious coloration that was absent from the early
New Right. In lieu of a more distinctive post-bourgeois ideology, Christian
fundamentalism filled the vacuum as an ideological vehicle, but since the
aspirations of the post-bourgeois proletariat were essentially secular and
social rather than religious and moral, right-wing Christianity (especially
when packaged electronically) could not express the reality of their interests
and aspirations as an emerging social and political force. While defense of
“traditional morality” was  an  important theme in  both  the  Wallace
movement and  early  New  Right  efforts  (the  West  Virginia  textbook
controversy,  for  example), there  was  little  religious orientation to  these
campaigns. The  cosmopolitan and  hedonistic proclivities of  the  elite
frequently alienated, challenged, and subverted post-bourgeois beliefs and
institutions through  the  prohibition of  prayer in  the  public  schools,
opposition to censorship of pornography, and tolerance for abortion, sexual
permissiveness and deviance, but post-bourgeois interests in these issues
reflected their  defense of  a  concrete, secular way  of  life  threatened by
managerial acceleration and not, for the most part, a religious concern; and
they concentrated on the perceived challenge that “obscene” textbooks and
“permissiveness” represented to their way of life and its defining values
rather than on the more abstract religious and ethical dimensions of the
threat.
Indeed, the  highly politicized and  secularized content of  much
evangelical Christian activism and  the  relative absence of  serious
theological and  devotional efforts  strongly suggest that  the  principal
momentum behind the  mass  following of  the  Christian Right  was  the
secular and political aspirations of post-bourgeois social forces, which used

and were used by evangelical clergymen, and not a religious “awakening.”
In periods of history when genuine religious movements have prevailed,
such as the fourth century A.D. or the 16th-century Reformation, discussion
even at a popular level of abstruse theological topics, church history, and
liturgy has been common, yet these interests seem to have been unusual
among most adherents of evangelical Christian groups in the 1970s and
1980s. Although evangelicalism was  able  to  mobilize large  numbers of
activists for  causes related to  religious and  moral issues, it  generally
distracted the secular, radical social and political consciousness of the post-
bourgeois proletariat and derailed a potentially revolutionary nationalist and
populist movement by enveloping it in a “false consciousness” that did little
to reflect post-bourgeois interests and values. Both bourgeois conservatism
and evangelical Christianity thus served as expedient ideological vehicles
for post-bourgeois consciousness and interests, but neither expressed or was
able to develop a distinctive post-bourgeois anti-managerial identity, and
the effect of both ideological currents was to draw the New Right away
from the goals of its early radical anti-managerial impulses.
The absence of a distinctive post-bourgeois ideological vehicle and the
infusion of bourgeois and Christian conservative ideological and political
preoccupations into the New Right served to retard the evolution of an
enduring post-bourgeois consciousness, and the emergence of a Yuppie elite
within the  New  Right and  neoconservative organizations served to
differentiate these organizations from their largely post-bourgeois social and
political base both in life-styles and interests. These weaknesses of the post-
bourgeois resistance all facilitated the assimilation of the post-bourgeois
anti-managerial movement by the managerial regime. By the later 1980s,
neoconservatism, providing an  adapted rationalization of  the  soft
managerial regime, had become the prevalent ideological vehicle of the

New  Right, and  New  Right groups had  become financially and
intellectually dependent on neoconservative and managerial forces. Richard
Viguerie, as early as 1981, had said, “We’ve all got the same complaint”
## [580]
in welcoming neoconservatives to the New Right movement, apparently
under the  illusion that  post-bourgeois  and  managerial interests were
consistent, and Paul M. Weyrich, executive director of the Committee for
the Survival of a Free Congress and originally one of the most militant and
outspoken New Right leaders, in 1984 wrote of Irving Kristol’s Reflections
of a Neoconservative that the “distinctive features of neoconservatism” as
Kristol described them “come closer to a general statement of what some in
the New Right strain of conservatism believe than anything else in popular
print.”
## [581]
By 1986 Weyrich was collaborating with neoconservatives in the
formulation of  what  he  called  “cultural conservatism,” a  highly diluted
adaptation of New Right ideology that sought to legitimize the role of the
managerial state in manipulating “traditional values.” “We believe,” he said
in introducing the concept, that
government not only can but must be a positive force, a force for good. If conservatives
intend to seek a mandate to govern, they must be prepared to govern, prepared with a
broad  array  of  policy actions. .  .  .  [C]ultural conservatism .  .  .  calls  to  liberals and
moderates as well as fellow conservatives to join in upholding and rebuilding our national
culture, the culture on which liberalism as much as conservatism depends.
## [582]
Although the “cultural conservative” formula ostensibly was intended to
legitimize the role of the state in reinforcing traditional (i.e., bourgeois)
values and institutions, in fact it rationalized the manipulation of traditional
culture by the managerial state. As a neoconservative exponent of cultural
conservatism, Chester E. Finn, Jr., wrote,
This  is  no  static  or  exclusive culture, of  course. It  is  distinguished by  its  ability  to
assimilate—and be changed and improved by—the customs, idioms, and enthusiasms of
immigrants and refugees from around the world. We don’t submerge our individual and
group distinctions. But we are united by what we have in common, not by how we differ.
## [583]

Neoconservative Secretary of Education William Bennett also endorsed
the  new  slogan of  “cultural conservatism” that  served as  a via  media
reconciling the New Right to its assimilation by the soft managerial regime.
## [584]
The  result of  the  assimilation  of  the  New  Right movement  by
managerial forces was the decapitation of the post-bourgeois resistance to
the managerial regime and the resolution of the political challenge it issued.
Whereas in 1980, only 25 percent of the adult population of the United
States believed that the U.S. government could be trusted to do the right
thing all or most of the time, in 1984 44 percent believed it could be trusted.
The decline of such polarization, much of which had derived from post-
bourgeois  frustrations, was  ascribed to  the  Reagan presidency.  Ronald
Reagan himself, said historian James MacGregor Burns, “brought a sense
of  respectability and  a  sense  of  responsibility to  conservatism,” and  by
reducing inflation from 14 percent in 1979 to 4 percent in 1987, the Reagan
administration removed a major precipitant of the post-bourgeois resistance.
The  results of  the  assimilation  were  visible in  the  transformation  of
American conservatism from  a  bourgeois  movement that  resisted the
managerial state  and  sought its  dismantlement to  a  movement that  was
content with  the  present structure and  functions of  the  state  and  the
cosmopolitan tendencies of  mass  culture. By  1987  the  long-standing
conflict within the Republican Party between bourgeois and post-bourgeois
elements, on the one hand, which had supported Taft, McCarthy, Goldwater,
and Reagan, and the managerial forces, on the other, which had allied with
Dewey, Eisenhower,  Rockefeller,  and  Ford,  had  been  resolved. “It’s
establishment conservatism,” said Lance Tarrance, a pollster for presidential
candidate Rep. Jack Kemp, “The days when there were two challenging

factions, those days are over.”
## [585]
Although Kemp sought to present himself
as  an  “anti-establishment” candidate, his  campaign and  rhetoric did  not
deviate from the neoconservative and Yuppie formulas that had come to
prevail in the elite of the Republican Party and the American right. Irving
Kristol was  described by The  Washington  Post  as  Kemp’s  “intellectual
tutor,”
## [586]
and as Newsweek noted in 1984 discussing the political direction
of young, upwardly mobile professionals:
The Republicans’ best hopes for enticing the Yuppie vote probably lie with fortyish leaders
like New York Rep. Jack Kemp—at 49 a baby boomer’s older brother—and with actual
Yuppies like Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota, 32, whose vision of “the opportunity society”
includes civil rights. “The younger Republicans who have been out here,” says Silicon
Valley, Calif., publicist Regis McKenna, “are talking about opening up opportunities for
minorities and women. . . . [T]hey’re sounding like Democrats.”
## [587]
Kemp based  his  1988  presidential campaign on  appeals to  young,
upwardly mobile professionals, urban  blacks, women, and  immigrants
through his  vocal  support for  civil  rights  legislation, deregulation and
similar “economic opportunity” measures, and  the  elimination of
immigration restrictions, and  he  deliberately avoided appealing to  the
middle class base of the Republican Party. “I don’t want the Republican
Party to be an all-white party, an all white-collar party, a business party or a
middle-class party,” he told Republican voters in Michigan in 1987, and he
promised to compete with the Democrats “not just in the Sun Belt but in the
ghettoes and the barrios.”
## [588]
He also professed no opposition to the size
and scale of government, as traditional conservatives had. “‘Getting the
government off the backs of the American people’ will be no one’s slogan
in 1988,” Kemp said, “Making government more efficient and effective will
be the thing this time. I’ve never understood why conservatives positioned
themselves against government.” Paul Weyrich added, consistent with his
“cultural conservatism,” “We can’t ignore problems in society and hope
they go away. The truth is that some of us believe in government activism,”

and he argued that “too often, we [bourgeois conservatives and the New
Right] have  attempted to  reject  the  obligation welfare represents, the
obligation to the poor, the homeless, the unemployed and the disabled. . . .
We  accept the  obligation welfare  represents.”
## [589]
The  resistance to  the
expansion and enlargement of the managerial state and the defense of the
bourgeois order, the distinctive features of bourgeois conservatism from the
time of the New Deal, were thus abandoned, and a neoconservative (more
precisely, managerial conservative) defense of the managerial state, of its
manipulative role  in  the  economy and  culture, and  an  appeal  to  the
underclass were  adopted by  the  assimilated conservative leaders  of  the
1980s. Whatever the future prospects of the soft managerial regime and
whatever the opportunities for post-bourgeois resistance in the future, the
regime was successful in the 1980s in assimilating and circumventing the
post-bourgeois  challenge of  that  decade through its  manipulation of  the
Reagan presidency and  the  leadership of  the  post-bourgeois  resistance,
through its  formulation of  an  adapted managerial ideology,  and  by  the
differentiation of the leadership of the post-bourgeois resistance from its
mass base.

The Future of the Post-Bourgeois
## Resistance
Although the  managerial elite  was  successful in  assimilating the
leadership of  the  post-bourgeois  resistance and  responding to  the  post-
bourgeois challenge, it was less successful in stabilizing the regime and
formulating a new ideological consensus that would unify the elite. By the
1970s the  tendencies of  the  regime to  continuing acceleration were
threatening to become too powerful to be stabilized or contained within the
prescribed boundaries of mass organizations and managerial manipulation.
Technological innovation, economic change, social mobility, and cultural
and  intellectual ferment inevitably escaped and  often  challenged these
boundaries, and social and political forces associated with the processes of
acceleration—among the “New Class,” the new entrepreneurs, young urban
professionals—could not be contained within a new managerial orthodoxy.
Neoconservatism, or  managerial conservatism, could  accommodate only
some of these forces, especially those with direct interests in preserving the
dominance of  mass  organizations; but  others articulated ideologies that
deviated from or  challenged orthodoxies that  rationalized mass
organization, reliance on technical and managerial skills, and the whole
rationalistic, secularist, and  technological worldview on  which the
managerial regime was founded.
Nor could managerial conservatism contain the post-bourgeois forces
that persisted despite the decapitation of their political movement. While
neoconservative ideology was  in  some  respects compatible with  post-
bourgeois interests in its advocacy of a “conservative welfare state” that

would provide economic security while modifying or controlling forces of
acceleration that would erode and subvert social institutions and cultural
values, it  revealed no  disposition to  seek  a  transformation or  a  radical
restructuring of  the  soft  regime that  would have  responded to  post-
bourgeois aspirations and interests, and it was unable to carry out the kind
of transformation of the regime that would have been necessary to stabilize
it permanently and that post-bourgeois forces demanded. Neoconservatism
readily identified the “New Class,” the radical cosmopolitan and relativist
formulas that  the  “New  Class” used,  and  the  forces of  acceleration it
sponsored as enemies, but it was unable to devise a means of eliminating or
permanently subduing the  “New Class” and  its  political and  social
aspirations. Michael Novak perceived that “The new class is a formidable
danger to  democratic capitalism”
## [590]
since  New  Class demands for
dominance within the regime and for destabilizing forms of acceleration
threatened to  destroy the  balance among the  sectors of  the  regime and
undermine its structure and functioning. Yet Novak was confronted with a
dilemma that  expressed the  basic  contradiction of  the  soft  managerial
regime and reflected the crisis that it experienced. On the one hand, he
emphasized that  “the moral-cultural system is the chief dynamic force
behind the rise both of a  democratic political system and of a  liberal
economic system,”
## [591]
the source of the “continuous revolution” over which
the  regime presides; yet,  on  the  other  hand,  he  also  recognized that
“Democratic capitalism is  more  likely  to  perish through its  loss  of  its
indispensable ideas  and  morals than  through weaknesses in  its  political
system or its economic system. In its moral-cultural system lies its weakest
link.”
## [592]
Since the “New Class” is principally located in the managerial
elite  of  the  mass  organizations of  culture and  communication, which
dominate and  manipulate the  “moral-cultural system,” there  can  be  no

elimination or  radical restructuring  of  that  system and  its  elite  without
eliminating the main source of “continuous revolution” and acceleration.
The extirpation of the “New Class” and the managerial cultural apparatus,
then, would fundamentally wound the soft managerial regime, since in the
absence of the acceleration and innovation the New Class and its cultural
apparatus generate, there would be no application for the managerial and
technical skills in the manipulation of social change and the problems and
conflicts that change creates. In the absence of continuous acceleration, the
soft managerial elite—both the “New Class” as well as its older siblings in
the corporate and bureaucratic elites of the managerial state and managerial
economy—would lose the functions that are the foundations of its power,
status, and rewards as an elite. The problem for the managerial elite was not
to eliminate acceleration and its sources but to contain acceleration and its
products within managerial disciplines. The  “New Class” itself  was
unwilling or  unable to  accept these  disciplines, since  they  presented
obstacles to its own aspirations to dominance and would have involved a
subordination to or compromise with other sectors of the elite in the mass
corporations and unions and in the older components of the managerial
state, from which demands for managed and stabilized acceleration issued.
Unable to  resolve this  dilemma, the  formulas of  managerial
conservatism were reduced to mere exhortation in their efforts to induce the
“New Class” to support stabilization. “A war of ideas is being fought in
many minds and hearts,” wrote Novak. “Many, battling in this war, change
their minds. Within us, there is a battle between the competing ideals of
democratic capitalism and democratic socialism. On its outcome, the future
shape of our society depends.”
## [593]
The “battle,” however, was not between
ideas but between two different components within the elite, each of which
was  wedded to  apparently divergent  interests and  aspirations that  arose

from  the  very  nature of  the  soft  managerial regime; and  although the
relationship between the two components appeared to its participants as a
“battle,” in fact it was more of a symbiosis. The forces of acceleration used
managerial skills and mass organizations to generate change, conflict, and
problems through which they enhanced their own power, while the forces of
consolidation sought to  contain, manage, manipulate, and  assimilate the
acceleration through  the  disciplines and  structures of  the  regime that
allowed them to enhance their power. Despite the “adversary” relationship
that apparently pertained between them, then, neither component of the elite
could exist or retain or enhance its power and rewards without the functions
provided by the other, and though the tensions between them protracted the
crisis of the regime, there could be no stable resolution of this crisis without
impairing, restructuring, or transforming the regime.
The permanence of the crisis and the inability of the regime to eliminate
or control its tendency to acceleration mean that the managerial assault on
the remnants of the bourgeois order and on the values and institutions of the
post-bourgeois  proletariat will  continue and  that  the  reaction  by  post-
bourgeois forces to this assault will revive and persist. Whereas this assault
in the early 20th century, in the period of managerial emergence, took the
form mainly of challenging the political and economic power base of the
bourgeois  elite—its political power in  the  local  community  and  in
congressional and legislative institutions and  its  economic power in  the
independent entrepreneurial firm—since the period of acceleration began in
the 1960s, the assault has concentrated principally on the social and cultural
institutions of  bourgeois  and  post-bourgeois  groups. The  civil  rights
movement challenged not only the racial particularism of these groups but
also  their  social, political, and  intellectual foundations, extending the
managerial state  into  the  manipulation of local communities,

entrepreneurial firms, and local educational institutions and inculcating the
environmentalist and  meliorist premises and  cosmopolitan ethic  of
managerial ideology.  In  the  1970s  feminism and  the  “sexual liberation”
movement challenged bourgeois and  post-bourgeois control of  the
processes and  institutions of  socialization in  the  family,  the  home, the
school, and  in  new  pre-school institutions. The  secularization and
syncretistic tendencies of  managerial cosmopolitanism challenged the
persistent non-rational religious and  moral premises of  the  bourgeois
worldview,  fragments of  which re-emerged  in  post-bourgeois
fundamentalism. The  continuing and  accelerating dematerialization of
property, represented in the evolution of an “international economy” and
new  technologies and  procedures for  mass  consumption through credit,
challenges not only the economic institutions and values of the bourgeois
order  but  also  promotes the  integration of  the  mass  population into  the
manipulative managerial disciplines of hedonism, relativism, and
cosmopolitanism. New constituencies for managerial acceleration emerge
through mass immigration, providing a new underclass as the political and
cultural fulcrum  for  the  manipulative assault on  the  remnants of  the
bourgeois order and the post-bourgeois proletariat, and the prospect of new
policies and  programs of  the  managerial state  on  behalf of  the  new
underclass raises the possibility of the resumption of inflation and the rise
of tax rates through increased government expenditures.
Managerial conservatism offers only tepid resistance to these new and
continuing forces of acceleration and to those elements of the managerial
elite actively promoting and using them, and it is neither willing nor able to
provide a  stable resolution of  the  challenges they  create. While  post-
bourgeois forces may temporarily be content with the stabilization of the
regime that the Reagan presidency achieved, these forces of acceleration

and  the  challenges they  represent will  ensure the  continuation of  post-
bourgeois  resistance to  the  regime and  perhaps the  emergence of  an
enduring radical anti-managerial post-bourgeois consciousness. The
decapitation of  the  post-bourgeois  resistance by  the  regime in  the  early
1980s and the demise of its political and ideological vehicles may actually
encourage a  post-bourgeois  radicalism in  the  aftermath of  the  Reagan
administration during the  1990s, since  the  erosion of  bourgeois  and
Christian conservatism and the assimilation of managerial elements in the
New  Right may  leave post-bourgeois frustrations without  political
expression. Post-bourgeois forces would then find it possible to develop a
consciousness and  an  identity independent of  the  deformations and
pseudomorphosis infused by bourgeois, Christian, new entrepreneurial, and
managerial elements and to formulate an ideology and a movement that
would correspond largely  or  exclusively to  post-bourgeois  interests and
aspirations, challenge the  soft  managerial regime, and  work  toward the
metamorphosis of the regime into an apparatus of power in which the post-
bourgeois  proletariat would emerge  as  the  dominant minority.  Kevin
Phillips in  the  early  1980s suggested the  possibility of  a  similar
development in American politics, before the economic recovery under the
Reagan presidency helped to assimilate the post-bourgeois challenge of the
previous decade. Comparing the  economic dislocation and  middle class
frustrations of the Weimar Republic with the contemporary discontents of
post-bourgeois strata in the United States—“Both involve a movement to
the  right,  a  politics increasingly nationalistic, a  return to  folkways and
traditional values and  the  rejection of  avant-garde culture”
## [594]
—Phillips
argued that, in the event of the failure of Reagan’s economic policies,
by the 1990s the balance of power could rest with a populist or corporatist brand of
conservatism that  combines business interests with  blue-collar and  social-issue
constituencies. Many issues would pull the lower-middle-class and blue-collar electorates

into this group—crime, race, nationalism. Protectionism and immigration are also issues
unions share with conservatives. This aggregation would support activist government on
economic matters, aiding troubled industries and farmers, while at the same time adhering
to a relatively conservative position on moral issues.
## [595]
Despite the relative success of the economic recovery under Reagan, the
evanescence of traditional conservative political and ideological vehicles
and  the  continuing acceleration of  changes perceived by  post-bourgeois
forces as threats to their interests and values could activate the kind of
social and political movement that Phillips predicted.
Whether the managerial regime in its present configuration could resist
or assimilate such a radical post-bourgeois challenge remains problematical.
In  any  case,  the  continuing acceleration that  is  now  endemic  in  the
managerial regime will generate, and is generating, changes and forces that
will also challenge managerial power, regardless of the future of the post-
bourgeois resistance. The possibility exists that the soft managerial regime
will  be  unable to  contain and  manipulate the  products of  acceleration
through its mass organizations and managerial disciplines, that the regime
will  begin  to  lose  control of  the  forces it  has  created, and  that  the
manipulative styles of dominance associated with the Class I residues that
prevail in the soft elite will be unable to control these forces. If so, and if
these new challenges can be met by a style of dominance associated with
Class II residues, the unrestricted reliance on coercion and the evocation of
solidarist and  ascetic derivations and  formulas, then  the  dynamics of
acceleration may,  through its  consequences, provide an  aperture in  the
structure of the elite through which a post-bourgeois resistance, exhibiting a
prevalence of Class II residues, could enter and acquire enduring social
power.

The Vulnerabilities of the Soft Managerial
## Regime
The revolution of  mass  and  scale  and  the  managerial regimes that
emerged from it are the most recent and the most extreme manifestations of
the world-historical process that Max Weber called “the disenchantment of
the  world.”  Mass  organizations displace or  destroy the  traditional, non-
rational, and personal disciplines by which the institutions of pre-industrial
societies and even early bourgeois industrial and commercial society were
governed. Mass  organizations are  operated in  accordance with  that
“intellectualist rationalization, created by  science and  by  scientifically
oriented technology,” which Weber saw as the principal theme of modern
history. The “disenchantment of the world” means the emergence of the
belief that “there are no mysterious incalculable forces that come into play,
but rather that one can, in principle, master all things by calculation. . . .
Technical means and calculations perform the service.”
## [596]
The application
of “technical means” to human society through mass organizations is the
distinctive characteristic of the managerial regimes, soft and hard, of the
20th century. The collapse of prescriptive and bourgeois institutions under
the  impact of  mass  populations,  industrialization, urbanization, and
technology and the availability of new “technical means” in the form of
managerial skills permitted the emergence of new elites that perceived the
processes of disenchantment and social rationalization as opportunities for
the enhancement of their own power. Consequently, the new elites sought to
accelerate these processes and to direct them in opposition to the social and
political forces that had prevailed in the past.
Weber’s  understanding of  this  long-term historical trend of

“disenchantment,” “intellectualization,” or  “rationalization” in  many
respects resembles the theory of Pitirim Sorokin that the present era is one
of transition toward what he called “Ideational Culture” and away from the
“Sensate Culture” that, originating in the 16th century,
is based upon, and is integrated around, this new principle-value: the true reality and value
is sensory. It is precisely this principle that is articulated by our modern sensate culture in
all its main compartments: in its arts and sciences, philosophy and pseudo-religion, ethics
and law; in its social, economic, and political organization; in its dominant ways of life and
mentality.  .  .  .  [T]he  present crisis  of  our  culture and  society consist exactly in  the
disintegration of the dominant sensate system of Euro-American culture.
## [597]
The sensate worldview, recognizing as real only the material, empirical,
and sensory dimensions of the world, corresponds to the “disenchanted,”
rationalized, calculative worldview described by  Weber,  and  it  also
resembles the  worldview dominant  in  the  historical phase  that  Oswald
Spengler called “Civilization,” the terminal phase of a cultural organism.
Spengler’s “Civilization,” as Sorokin described it, is characterized by
cosmopolitanism and  the  megalopolis vs.  “home,” “race,” “blood group,” and
“fatherland”; scientific irreligion or abstract dead metaphysics instead of the religion of the
heart; “cold  matter-of-factness” vs.  reverence and  tradition and  respect for  age;
international “society” instead of “my country” and state (nation); “natural rights” in place
of hard-earned rights; money and abstract value in lieu of fruitful earth and real (living)
values; “mass” instead of “folk”; sex in lieu of motherhood; panem et circenses in place of
religious and  spontaneous folk-festivals;  imperialistic expansion, urbanization,
internationalization, the  outward direction of  Civilization-man’s  energy  instead of  the
inward-direction of the Culture-man; the cult of bigness, syncretism, lust for power, class
struggle instead of quality and unity; and so on.
## [598]
Spengler’s  perception of cosmopolitanism, hedonism, scientism,
secularism, mass  cities  and  societies, “abstract value,” and  the  “cult  of
bigness” (corresponding to Sorokin’s “colossalism”) includes the dominant
features of the soft managerial regimes of the 20th century. Vilfredo Pareto
also saw the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a period in which “Class I
residues and the findings of logico-experimental science have widened the
field of their sway. . . . We would not be mistaken, therefore, in ascribing to

‘reason’ an increasingly important role in human activity,”
## [599]
and Sorokin’s
characterization of  the  “ideational” and  “sensate” cultures resembles in
many respects Pareto’s description of societies ruled by elites in which the
residues of Class II (lions) and Class I (foxes) prevail.
While these and other major social thinkers of the era tended to concur
on the main features of Western society in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, they differed widely in their explanations of these phenomena
and  in  their  views of  the  future. Weber  saw  disenchantment and
intellectualization as unilinear historical processes, unlikely to be reversed
or  halted,  though periodically interrupted by  irrationalist forces such  as
charismatic leadership. Sorokin and Spengler, however, both saw their age
as  the  final  stage  of  a  historical  cycle,  likely  to  be  replaced by  a  new
“ideational” culture or by a young cultural organism that would succeed the
dying “Faustian” civilization. To Sorokin, “The managerial aristocracy of
present-day corporations are in the position of the decadent descendants of
a  full-blooded political aristocracy.”
## [600]
Pareto himself argued  that  the
emergent “pluto-democratic” elites, in which Class I residues prevailed and
which ruled  through manipulation, would eventually be  replaced by
military elites, in which Class II residues were dominant and which would
rule by force and its ideological correlates.
## [601]
Sorokin and Spengler viewed the era of managerial regimes as the age
of the decline of the Western culture of modernity. In the late 19th and early
20th centuries, however, the regime that was in process of dissolution was
that  of  the bourgeois  order,  which itself  was  the  final  stage  of  the
civilization that had arisen at the beginnings of the Western Middle Ages.
The managerial elites that emerged to challenge and displace the bourgeois
elite were not decadent bourgeois elements but a new social force that relied

on  new  instruments, technologies, and  organizations to  gain  power and
attempt to  form  a  distinctively new  civilization that  rejected both
prescriptive and bourgeois values and institutions. The relatively compact
institutions that  had  characterized both  the  medieval and  early  modern
prescriptive order as well as the industrial and commercial bourgeois order
collapsed under the strains of an unprecedented mass and scale of human
numbers and  their  social, economic, and  political interactions. The
bourgeois worldview, which had become dominant throughout much of the
West in the course of the 19th century and centered on a socially rooted
individuality and  the  ideologies and  political formulas derived from  it,
ceased to  reflect the  values, aspirations, and  perceptions of  either  the
masses or the intellectual and cultural elites that were emerging. Bourgeois
leadership, based  on  locally and  personally ruled  organizations, proved
unable to retain control of dominant institutions as they evolved into mass
organizations and came to depend on managerial and technical skills that
the bourgeois elite did not possess. Despite bourgeois efforts to adapt to the
new mass and scale, the wars, economic collapse, and social and political
movements of  the  early  20th  centuries forced the  evolution of  new
organizations, new  techniques of  social and  political control, a  new
worldview and  ideology,  and  a  new  elite  that  increasingly found  itself
differentiated from  its  bourgeois  origins. The  process of  differentiation
involved a challenge to the remnants of the bourgeois order as well as the
displacement of the bourgeois elite from political, economic, and cultural
dominance, and  it  led  to  the  germination of  a  new  order,  perhaps the
embryonic form  of  a  new  civilization, centered on  the  nucleus  of  the
managerial elite.
Commentators on the revolution of the 20th century such as Sorokin and
Spengler (as well as Weber) did not view the revolution as the consequence

of an elite acting in pursuit of its interests and aspirations for power, but as
the  historical elaboration of  an  idea  or  as  part  of  the  life-cycle of
autonomous cultural  organisms. Their  concentration on  the  role  of  such
abstract forces in history tended to distract them from the more central role
of the new elite itself in creating and shaping the new order. The principal
features of  the  managerial regime, including those  noted  by  Spengler,
Sorokin, and Weber, developed from efforts of the emerging managerial
elite to challenge the old bourgeois elite and to acquire, consolidate, and
enhance its  own  dominance. These efforts  involved the  creation of  an
apparatus in  which managerial  and  technical skills  could  be  applied to
political, economic, and cultural arrangements in ways that would not only
yield power to those who possessed such skills but also exclude from power
those who lacked them. Mass organizations in state, economy, and culture
proved to be the most effective instruments for the seizure of social power
by the new elite, and continuous enlargement of mass organizations and
encouragement and manipulation of social change within the disciplines of
mass organizations offered the most rewarding opportunities for extending
the scope of managerial and technical skills and enhancing the power of
those groups that had acquired them. The conflict with the bourgeois order
also involved the discrediting of the bourgeois worldview and its derivative
ideology and  the  articulation of  a  new  worldview and  ideology that,
disseminated through the mass organizations of culture and communication,
rationalized the dominance of the new elite. In formulating the managerial
worldview and ideology, the intellectual and verbalist classes of the soft
managerial regime made use of secularist, scientific, and rationalist ideas
that reflected the processes of Weber’s disenchantment, Sorokin’s sensate
values, and  the  characteristics of  Spenglerian civilization. These ideas,
some  of  which had  circulated  in  the  Western intellectual milieu for

centuries, informed the  dominant  philosophical, ethical, religious,  legal,
political, and aesthetic expressions and codes of the managerial era. The
political, economic, and cultural transformation of the 20th century thus
proceeded from the managerial elite itself and its aspirations for dominance.
The institutional and intellectual-cultural features of the century were the
products of  the  internal structure and  composition of  the  elite  and  the
instruments and opportunities available to it for realizing its aspirations.
An understanding of the formative role of the dominant minority of the
soft managerial regime in shaping the revolution of the 20th century makes
possible an analysis of the prospects of the regime in terms of the dynamics
and  the  internal structure and  composition of  its  elite.  While  the  soft
managerial elite in the Western world and particularly in the United States
has  constructed  an  apparatus of  power that  has  created and  organized
resources and techniques for dominance unique in human history, and while
it  has  so  far  in  this  century successfully challenged, displaced, or
assimilated its  rivals, the  elite  is  neither omnipotent nor  infallible. Its
dominance is limited by the very nature of its apparatus, interests, ideology,
and psychic and behavioral patterns as well as by the social and political
forces that it has created in the process of acquiring, consolidating, and
enhancing its power. These limits constrain the actions, ideas, and resources
the elite can use to respond to challenges in the future, and new social and
political forces hostile to the elite and its regime may possess or acquire
material or intellectual resources for challenging the soft managerial regime
in  ways  to  which  the  elite  is  unable to  respond successfully.  Indeed,
analysis of the soft managerial regime in terms of the internal dynamics,
structure, and  composition of  its  elite—rather than  in  terms of  the
disembodied ideas,  cultural organisms, and  historical cycles favored by
Weber, Spengler, and Sorokin—shows that it exhibits serious vulnerabilities

that,  if  exploited by  hostile social  and  political forces, could  lead  to  a
historically significant destabilization or transformation of the regime in the
future.
Pareto as well as Gaetano Mosca recognized that an elite or ruling class
composed of only one or a few dominant social forces is likely to represent
a  danger  to  social  and  political groups outside the  elite.  “The  absolute
preponderance of a single political force,” wrote Mosca,
the  predominance of  any  over-simplified concept in  the  organization of  the  state,  the
strictly logical  application of  any  single  principle in  all  public law  are  the  essential
elements in any type of despotism, whether it be a despotism based upon divine right or a
despotism based  ostensibly on  popular sovereignty,  for  they  enable anyone who  is  in
power to exploit the advantages of a superior position more thoroughly for the benefit of
his own interests and passions.
## [602]
The ascendancy of a more or less uniform elite, in Mosca’s view, not
only allows unrestrained power to accumulate under the control of a single,
dominant force but also excludes from power and other social rewards those
other  social  groups that  possess  skills, resources, and  ideas  that  could
contribute to the cultural efflorescence and invigoration of a society and
strengthen its  capacity to  respond  to  challenges successfully.  While the
political result  of  a  monolithic elite  is  despotism and  the  irregular and
unrestrained use of power for the interests of the elite, the result for the
larger social order—and eventually for the elite itself—is a contraction of
the cultural, intellectual, and material life of the society, the narrowing of
the range of resources on which its elite can draw, and the loss of the
flexibility necessary for adapting to new ideas, social change, and hostile
internal or external challenges, whether material or psychic. A society ruled
by a contracted, monolithic elite lacks sufficient breadth and resilience to
ensure its  survival in  the  face  of  the  diverse challenges that  it  may
encounter in the course of its history.

The elite of the soft managerial regime closely resembles the kind of
contracted, monolithic social force  that  Mosca discussed. Unlike the
aristocratic and bourgeois elites of the past, the soft managerial elite bases
its social dominance almost entirely on the single social force of modern
managerial and technical skills. The science of management is necessary for
the operation and direction of the mass organizations of government, the
economy, and the culture, and those social groups that lack proficiency in
the science of management and its application to social arrangements are
unable to gain leadership positions within the mass organizations and are
largely excluded from power in the regime. The science and techniques of
management may be applied to the direction of any mass organization, and
the elite that uses these techniques to direct one kind of mass organization
may also, with little variation, use them to direct others. Thus the elites of
the mass political, economic, and cultural organizations are interchangeable
and  indeed fused  or  interdependent with  each  other.  There is  in  fact
considerable interchange among the  elites of  the  mass  managerial
organizations, and the uniformity of managerial techniques tends to impart
to those proficient in their application a uniform mentality, ideology, and
perceived set of interests.
The formal mechanisms of mass liberal democracy—regular elections,
competing political parties, universal suffrage, and legal and political rights
—do not significantly mitigate the monolithic and uniform concentration of
managerial power.  While legal  rights of  expression provide formal
protection for anti-managerial movements, the manipulation of information,
images, and  symbols by  the  managerial organizations of  culture and
communication and  their  elite  tends  to  neutralize the  political and
propaganda efforts  of  most  anti-managerial forces. Moreover,  anti-
managerial political movements that  rely  on  democratic political

mechanisms to  restrain the  power  of  or  gain  access to  the  elite  must
themselves make use of managerial skills in raising funds, manipulating
public opinion,  and  organizing and  managing campaigns in  order  to
compete effectively in the electoral process. Since the principal sources of
such skills lie in the elite itself, managerial elements are infused into even
anti-managerial movements and  tend  to  predominate in  their  political
efforts that seek to make use of managerial skills. The electoral process at
the  national and  increasingly at  the  state  and  local  levels  serves to
assimilate anti-managerial challenges into  the  elite  or  effectively to
neutralize or  manipulate their  resistance. The  regime successfully
assimilated and neutralized the resistance of bourgeois conservatism, the
New Left of the 1960s, and the New Right of the 1970s, and even though it
accommodated some aspirations of these forces, it was able to blunt and
defeat their more radical demands for the dismantlement of the apparatus of
mass  organizations  and  the  end  of  managerial manipulation of  social
arrangements.
The formal legal and constitutional procedures of liberal democracy are
thus largely irrelevant to the concentrated social power of the managerial
elite. The late Herbert Marcuse noted that democratic “pluralism” “seems to
extend rather than reduce manipulation and coordination, to promote rather
than counteract the fateful integration. . . . Democracy would appear to be
the  most  efficient system of  domination,”
## [603]
and  Gaetano Mosca,
commenting on the flaws of the theory of separation of powers formulated
by Montesquieu and his “imitators,” noted that
such imitators have been inclined to stress its formal or, so to say, legalistic aspect rather
than  its  substantial or  social  aspect. They  have  often  forgotten that  if  one  political
institution is  to  be  an  effective curb  upon  the  activity of  another it  must  represent a
political force—it must, that is, be the organized expression of a social influence and a
social authority that has some standing in the community, as against the forces that are
expressed in the political institution that is to be controlled.
## [604]

While the  anti-managerial forces of  the  post-bourgeois  resistance
constitute an  “organized expression  of  a  social  influence and  a  social
authority,”  they  are  compelled  to  challenge the  regime by  means of
organizational techniques and managerial skills that themselves serve to
infuse managerial elements into  positions of  leadership, dilute their
resistance, and absorb them within the apparatus of soft managerial power,
the very “political institution that is to be controlled.”
The uniformity of managerial techniques and their social applications
and  the  concentrated power of  the  elite  that  relies  on  them  for  social
dominance contrast with the diversity that characterized the elites of the
prescriptive and bourgeois orders. Although these elites also predominated
in their societies and imposed their interests and values on the larger social
order, the decentralized, localized, and personal apparatus by which they
held power tended to permit (and even require) considerably more variation
in the elite itself, in the techniques by which it ruled, and in the kind of
political, economic, and  cultural order  that  it  imposed or  encouraged.
Hence, these pre-managerial regimes often exhibited a pluralistic diffusion
of  power  represented in  the  balance of  local  against central authorities,
private and  intermediary social and  cultural institutions against public
political and legal structures, and local, regional, and subcultural diversities.
The pluralism of pre-managerial regimes, limited and contained within a
unity that defined the common interests of their elites, not only allowed a
wider range of competing centers of power but also yielded a social order
with a broader range of resources, ideas, and skills at its disposal than the
more narrow, contracted, unbalanced, and homogeneous managerial regime
in which “a single political force” preponderates.
Moreover, the comparative absence of uniform techniques and methods

of  dominance in  pre-managerial regimes to  some degree rendered
membership in their elites more accessible to the non-elite than is the case
in the managerial regime. While pre-managerial elites were based largely on
bonds of class, region, kinship, sect, inheritance, sexuality and ethnicity,
status, and external comportment and conformity with dominant social and
moral codes, the specific criteria for entry into such elites varied according
to local, subcultural, and personal standards. Different means of acquiring
wealth through agricultural, pastoral, commercial, and industrial activities
in  pre-managerial economies and  different avenues to  political power
through inheritance, patronage, war, and status served to diversify the social
and  psychic composition of  pre-managerial elites, and  the  tendency to
diversity within  these  elites  was  enhanced by  the  heterogeneous skills,
techniques, and talents that these paths to pre-eminence demanded.
## [605]
## By
contrast, the highly centralized scope of mass organizations, the dependence
of  their  elites  on  managerial skills,  and  the  uniform and  homogeneous
nature of the applications of their skills tend to exclude from the managerial
elite all elements of society that lack proficiency in managerial techniques
and do not conform to the uniform standards and psychic and behavioral
patterns for which such techniques select. Social and political forces that
seek to resist or restrain managerial dominance but lack the managerial and
technical skills  that  yield  power in  the  fused apparatus of  mass
organizations are unable to gain access to or advancement within the elite.
The social groups excluded from the managerial elite consist not only of
the  underclass but  also  of  the  bulk  of  the  post-bourgeois  working and
middle classes, which depend upon wages, salaries, and benefits dispensed
by the mass structures of the managerial economy but exercise little power
in either the corporate or labor organizations apart from their representation
by the elites of these structures. These post-bourgeois groups, materially

dependent on  but  imperfectly assimilated into  the  managerial regime,
generally lack access to the educational and training facilities that impart
the managerial skills necessary for entry into and advancement within the
elite, and the values and psycho-social character of post-bourgeois elements
generally do not dispose the members of these strata to acquire managerial
skills or aspire to inclusion in the elite.
Nevertheless, managerial skills and the means of acquiring them are
widely distributed  in  mass  society,  and  the  vulnerability of  the  soft
managerial elite  that  its  narrowness and  contraction represent derives
neither from the fact that the elite is a comparatively small minority of the
total  population  nor  from  lack  of  accessibility to  membership in  it.
Minorities appear to dominate all human societies except the most simple
and primitive, and there is no evidence that highly organized societies can
exist or function without elites or that the existence of elites and unequal
access to membership in them necessarily excite hostility to them or their
regimes or constitute a vulnerability. A more serious vulnerability of the
elite than any lack of accessibility to its ranks, however, derives from the
“despotic” character of the soft managerial regime.
The “despotism” of the regime—its tendency toward the monopolization
of political, economic, and cultural power by a single social and political
force of managerial and technical skills and the expansive, uniform, and
centralized nature of its power—is a direct consequence of the contracted
composition of the elite and the restriction of its membership to elements
proficient in managerial and technical skills. While such skills are relatively
accessible, only those who have acquired them actually are able to gain
entry to the elite and perform the highly technical functions of the mass
political, economic, and cultural organizations. The narrowness of the elite

that  results from  this  restriction  insulates it  from  the  influence of  non-
managerial social  and  political forces and  reduces their  ability to  gain
positions within the elite from which they can moderate, balance, or restrain
its commands, whether these are in the form of statute laws, court decisions,
bureaucratic directives, corporate or union policies, or the assertions of the
mass organizations of culture and communication. The limited access of
non-managerial forces to power and social rewards means that the regime
represents at least a potential threat to the aspirations and interests of these
groups, and their exclusion from the elite contributes to the frustration of
their  aspirations  and  interests and  encourages their  alienation from  and
conflict with the elite and the destabilization and weakening of the regime.
Moreover, the crystallization of the power of a single social and political
force, characterized by  a  common set  of  interests, ideology,  style  of
dominance, and  psychic and  behavioral patterns, serves to  promote the
contraction of  the  soft  regime  to  the  point  that  its  capacity to  offer  a
sufficiently broad range of  effective responses to  the  challenges it
encounters is severely restricted, and its chances of survival in the face of
these challenges are significantly diminished.
The potential threat that the despotism of the soft managerial regime
represents approaches actual tyranny through the dependence of the soft
elite on manipulation as a style of dominance. Because Pareto’s Class I
residues, yielding patterns of  manipulative mentality and  behavior,  are
prevalent in  the  psychic composition of  the  soft  elite  and  because the
interests, ideology,  and  apparatus of  the  elite  are  centered around the
manipulation of social arrangements, the regime relies on manipulation and
its ideological correlates of hedonism and cosmopolitanism as a means of
disciplining the subordinate society as well as a means of responding to
challenges. The reliance of the soft regime on manipulation is apparent in

its  elaboration of  formal routines that  facilitate and  institutionalize its
manipulative style  of  dominance and  replace the  more  spontaneous and
differentiated disciplines of  social institutions. The  inherent  structural
interests as well as the psychic composition of the soft elite also involve
reliance on manipulative routinization. The elite enhances its power through
the application of its manipulative skills to autonomous social, political, and
economic institutions, through continuous managed acceleration of social
change within the  framework  of  mass  organizations, and  through its
capacity for assimilating and manipulating social and political groups that
resist  it.  While the revolution of  mass  and  scale  eroded the  compact
bourgeois structures and social roles of the entrepreneurial firm, the family,
social class, local community, religious sect, and sexual and ethnic identity,
the  emergent  elite  acquired an  interest in  accelerating the  processes of
erosion and  in  replacing these  institutions and  their  non-managerial
disciplines with the routinized disciplines of mass organizations. The need
of  the  soft  elite  in  the  managerial state,  economy,  and  the  mass
organizations of  culture and  communication for  a  homogenized and
manipulable mass population subject to uniform manipulative disciplines
dictates the managerial destruction of the autonomous and heterogeneous
institutions, roles, and beliefs that offer barriers to its disciplines and their
replacement by the formal routines by which mass organizations operate.
Managerial routinization, in conjunction with the monolithic distribution
of power within the elite, contributes to the alienation of subordinate social
forces and to a protracted, destabilizing, and socially destructive conflict
within the soft regime, and it is the manipulation of social arrangements
through routinization and homogenization that constitutes the tyranny of the
soft regime in the perspective of the subordinate non-managerial groups. Its
tyrannical character is not for the most part manifested in acts of physical

coercion and repression as in most pre-managerial despotisms, however, but
in the proletarianization and cultural dispossession that the manipulative
routinization of social, economic, political, and cultural life inflicts. The
soft managerial regime thus constitutes a “soft despotism” (or, in Bertram
Gross’s phrase, a “friendly fascism”) that encourages the destruction of the
social order and deracinates and alienates the social forces subjected to its
manipulative routines.
In the economy, the managerial routines of production regulate the labor
of mass work forces in both offices and factories and consist not only of
formal rules and techniques governing the processes of production but also
of disciplines controlling social and personal interaction in the workplace.
Dress, etiquette, language, and personal comportment and associations are
adapted to uniform standards designed to eliminate or suppress individual
and subcultural variations and subordinate the totality of working life to the
interests of  the  mass economic structures and  their  elites. The
standardization of residential complexes and communities, commuting and
transportation, leisure, medical and legal services, and agriculture and the
production and distribution of food and clothing extends the routines of the
managerial economy to  private life.  Similar routines regulate mass
consumption, disciplined by  the  manipulated hedonism of  advertising,
financed through credit, and organized through mass structures of shopping
malls, supermarkets, franchised commodity stores, and  the  fast  food
industry. The routines of mass consumption are designed to discipline the
consumer by  creating and  manipulating homogeneous demands for
homogeneous goods and  services  through homogeneous processes and
structures of distribution.
The  consolidation  of  cultural life  under  the  disciplines of  the  mass

organizations of culture and communication—in bureaucratized schools and
universities, mass  religious institutions, journalistic and  publishing
conglomerates, and  the  electronic media of  information, opinion, and
entertainment—also requires the homogenization of the audience as well as
the  messages transmitted, and  the  managerial media establish uniform
routines of thought and expression that reflect the needs and interests of
their  elites. The  cultural routines imposed by  the  managerial media
inculcate the cosmopolitan and hedonistic worldview and its ethic, and they
challenge, eliminate, and  replace the  personal, social, and  subcultural
variations of  regional, religious, class,  sexual, ethnic, and  ideological
identity that  non-managerial institutions and  authorities generate. While
these routines permit a superficial diversity of ideas, values, and themes
centering on  trivial, exotic, transient, fashionable, sentimental, and
sensational events and  personalities, they  constrict the  intellectual and
emotional responses  of  the  mass  audiences of  the  media within  regular
boundaries that exclude some responses and infuse and manipulate others.
The  techniques by  which the  cultural routinization of  the  mass  media
manipulates the responses of their audiences include not only the limitation
of the content of the messages transmitted but also the manipulation of
symbols, language, and images for the creation of subrational associations;
the  selective presentation, arrangement, or  omission of  information and
images; and the simplification and abridgement of controversies through
slogans, false dichotomies, and symbolic phrases. The deceptive diversity
and  novelties  of  mass communications serve  to  distract their  audiences
from the disciplinary routines into which they are being assimilated and to
disguise the cultural homogenization and regimentation that the mass media
impose.
Managerial organizations and  their  elites  cannot effectively impose

economic and cultural homogenization unless the institutions that generate
social heterogeneity are weakened and their functions assumed by mass
organizations. The diffusion of the hedonistic and cosmopolitan ethic takes
place  not  simply through the  mass  dissemination of  ideas,  images, and
values but also through the institutional destruction and displacement that
managerial capitalism and cultural organizations instigate. Thus, managerial
corporations, as well as mass unions and the managerial state, displace the
social functions of the family and local community, while the routines of
mass  production and  consumption and  mass  culture displace integrative
family and domestic disciplines with their own routinized entertainment,
educational, and opinion-forming disciplines. Mass educational and child
care organizations displace parental authority and assume the functions of
socialization and economic support as well as educational functions and
serve to inculcate the hedonistic and cosmopolitan ethic and ideology of the
regime.
The disciplinary routinization and social destruction carried out by the
mass economic and  cultural organizations is  paralleled by  and
interdependent with the actions of the managerial state, the bureaucratic
elite of which also seeks the disintegration of autonomous social structures
and  the  extension of  its  own  power through manipulative social and
economic regulation. The  imperative of  homogenization in  the  state
involves the  centralization of  political functions, accomplished through
legislation and court decisions that supersede state and local autonomy and
create a uniform field on which centralized managerial power is unchecked
by the resistance of local government and intermediary institutions. At local
and  state  levels, the  expansion  of  government functions precipitates the
formation of  local  managerial elites  closely fused  with  the  elite  at  the
national level. Taxation, monetary policy, and the regulation of the economy

offer  mechanisms by  which the  elite  can  discipline and  manipulate
economic and social institutions. Provision of welfare, education, health
care, urban planning, rural development, and socially therapeutic functions
for children, the elderly, the poor, the homeless, the divorced, the sexually
frustrated, the mentally ill, the addicted, and the criminal contribute to the
replacement of social bonds and disciplines by bureaucratic agencies and
routines and allow the managerial elite within the mass state to extend its
dominance through its  own manipulative skills. The  therapeutic
bureaucracy of the elite re-defines and challenges normative bourgeois and
non-managerial values and institutions themselves as being “pathological”
and productive of social and personal aberrations, and it seeks to design
curative manipulative routines by which such aberrations and their causes
in  autonomous and  traditional institutions may  be  corrected and
reconstructed.
Although the managerial state also relies on incentives created through
fiscal, social, and regulatory policies to weaken private, social institutions
and  manipulate and  discipline the  mass  population, the  routinization of
social life by the managerial state, unlike that of the managerial economic
and  cultural organizations, is  directly supported by  legal  and  coercive
sanctions. Compulsory taxation, education, and regulation effectively force
the dissolution of private, autonomous institutions and relationships. The
criminalization of sexual and racial discrimination enforces and accelerates
the  replacement of  family bonds, sexual codes, and  sexual and  ethnic
identity by  the  routines of  the  state  and  gives  legal  sanction to  the
hedonistic and  cosmopolitan ethic.  The  uniform, legally obligatory,  and
formal routinization  enforced by  the  managerial state  thus  compels the
erosion of  non-managerial institutions and  authorities and  serves to
consolidate the power and legal authority of the managerial bureaucracy.

{The manipulative routinization imposed by the mass organizations of
the  state,  economy,  and  culture almost totally envelopes and  regulates
contemporary private as well as public and professional life. Individuals
working and living in metropolitan areas (as well as in many rural regions)
move, think,  and  communicate in  a  continuous interdependent web  of
routines that  discipline and  manipulate their  work, leisure activities,
residence, transportation, consumption, relationships with  government,
political beliefs  and  voting behavior,  family life,  care  and  education of
children, and  mental and  emotional responses. The  standardization,
impersonality,  and  unresponsiveness of  mass  organizations derive from
their  reliance on  routinization, which replaces the  more  flexible and
informal disciplines of the compact and autonomous social institutions and
contributes to  the  alienation and  frustration of  the  social groups and
individuals enveloped in them. The permeation of contemporary life by the
uniform and  centralized disciplines and  routines of  the  soft  managerial
regime means that the regime, so far from being the “open,” “pluralistic,”
and  diversified society of  a  cosmopolitan liberal democracy,  in  fact
constitutes a form of totalitarianism, in which private and personal as well
as  public  thought and  behavior are  homogenized and  manipulated in
accordance with the interests, psychic patterns, and ideological formulas of
a monolithic elite. As Marcuse noted,
The means of mass transportation and communication, the commodities of lodging, food,
and clothing, the irresistible output of the entertainment and information industry carry
with  them  prescribed attitudes and  habits,  certain intellectual and  emotional reactions
which bind the consumers more or less pleasantly to the producers and, through the latter,
to  the  whole. The  products indoctrinate  and  manipulate; they  promote a  false
consciousness which is immune against its falsehood.... Thus emerges a pattern of one-
dimensional thought and behavior in which ideas, aspirations, and objectives that, by their
content, transcend the established universe of discourse and action are either repelled by or
reduced to terms of this universe.
## [606][607]

The results of managerial social destruction and routinization are evident

in  the  brutalization of  contemporary  social  life—the increase  of  violent
crime, divorce and desertion, illegitimacy, abortion, child and spouse abuse,
mental derangement, suicide, sexual deviance, the  use  of  drugs  and
stimulants, and social irrationalism and destabilization. While the routines
imposed by the soft managerial elite serve to enhance its own power and to
regulate the mass population within the apparatus of mass organizations,
they are insufficient replacements for the informal, personal, private, and
local  disciplines provided by  the  heterogeneous and  autonomous social
institutions the regime has weakened. The managerial routines are designed
to enhance the dominance of the soft elite and the operations of the mass
organizations it controls, not to provide stable and satisfying psycho-social
bonds and functions for the subordinate society. The social dysfunctions
and destabilization that result are not permanent, however, since human
beings re-create or  re-invent adequate social  authorities as  part  of  their
biological and  psychological nature. Nevertheless, the  dynamic of  the
structural interests of  the  soft  managerial elite  requires the  continuous
acceleration of  managerial manipulation, and  the  efflorescence of  non-
managerial social bonds as  well  as  the  breakdowns resulting from
manipulation itself serve as opportunities for further socially destructive
manipulation by the elite. The need of the soft elite to enhance its power
continuously thus  forces it  into  a  perpetual struggle against subordinate
social groups and an incessant conflict with autonomous social institutions,
even when these are re-created in the aftermath of managerial challenges.
The  destruction and  displacement  of  autonomous social  bonds,
institutions, and  values by  the  institutionalized manipulation of  soft
managerial routinization and homogenization threaten and  alienate
subordinate social  forces and  deepen their  perception of  the  regime as
tyrannical and  hostile to  their  beliefs, habits, and  styles of  living.

Managerial manipulation and  routinization of  the  family,  neighborhood,
community, workplace and property relationships, sexual and ethnic norms
and relationships, and economic patterns of production and consumption
result in the deracination, proletarianization, and cultural dispossession of
subordinate social forces. The  infliction of  this  social and  cultural
destruction by the soft regime not only weakens social disciplines but also
encourages the  disaffection from  the  regime of  those  social  groups that
remain attached to their social and cultural institutions. The perception of
the  soft  regime as  a  tyrannical  force  involved in  the  manipulative
destruction of  norms and  institutions and  the  tensions, dislocations, and
conflicts that  result from  managerial manipulation are  the  direct
consequence of the structure and composition of the elite, the predominance
within it of a single, homogeneous managerial social force that exhibits a
uniform psychic and behavioral pattern predisposed to and dependent on
manipulation and by its structural interests is committed to the manipulation
of social arrangements. Thus, the “despotic” and contracted character of the
soft managerial regime that results from the concentration within the elite of
a  single,  uniform social and  political force  composed of  managerial
elements accounts for the reliance of the elite on socially destructive and
alienative manipulative routines as a means of disciplining and organizing
the  mass  population and  constitutes a  vulnerability of  the  regime that
derives from the structure and composition of the soft elite.
Yet  the  elite  not  only  weakens  and  alienates the  social groups
subordinate to  it  but  also,  because  of  its  psychic composition and  its
proclivity to a manipulative style of behavior and dominance, is unable to
respond adequately to  the  conflicts and  challenges that  its  manipulation
generates. The contraction of the elite and the preponderance within it of a
uniform social force and psychic and behavioral pattern constrict the range

of  resources and  responses on  which the  regime can  draw  in  meeting
societal challenges. The  prevalence  of  Class  I  residues in  the  psychic
composition of the elite, and the reliance of the elite on the manipulative
skills  and  styles  of  dominance that  Class  I  residues encourage,  tend  to
restrict the elite and the mass organizations it directs to only manipulative
and  assimilative responses to  societal challenges. While the  elite  has
developed a  highly sophisticated technology of  manipulation and
assimilation, it is at a disadvantage in using this technology to respond to
inassimilable and unmanipulable challenges, principally those that derive
from  hostile  elements in  which Class  II  residues prevail and  rely  on
coercion and its ideological correlates of asceticism and solidarism—for
example, protracted military challenges (as  in Vietnam), terrorism,
insurrectionary movements, and violent crime whether random or organized
in street gangs or drug cartels. The typical response of the soft elite to these
challenges consists  of  the  appointment of  commissions, the  holding of
hearings, the establishment of agencies, the coordination of administrative
functions, the  enlargement of  budgets and  trained manpower,  the
application of technical skills and technological resources, and reliance on
therapeutic, educational, diplomatic, and other manipulative measures. Such
responses, aimed at manipulating and assimilating violent challenges rather
than  resolving them  through counter-force, enhance the  power and
resources of the elite itself and the mass organizations under its control by
offering opportunities and incentives for the elite to apply its technical and
managerial skills  to  the  manipulation of  these  challenges; but  they  also
reflect the psychic patterns and ideological preconceptions of the elite. The
use of protracted or massive force to meet criminal or external violence
would contradict the hedonistic and cosmopolitan premises of managerial
ideology and involve the invocation of ascetic and solidarist values that

would rationalize the  postponement of  gratification, the  infliction or
acceptance of  suffering, and  solidarity with  national and  social  identity.
Because the  soft  elite  is  psychically,  behaviorally,  ideologically,  and
structurally unable  to  use  force  speedily,  massively,  or  for  protracted
periods or to appeal strenuously to group solidarity and postponement of
gratification, challenges that can be met in no other way receive inadequate
responses from the elite and are allowed to persist until they either burn
themselves out or until they overwhelm the regime. At the latter point, they
either lead to the destruction of the regime or provoke a circulation of the
elite away from Class I residues and toward those of Class II.
Even in the Reagan administration, which entered office in large part in
reaction to the flaccid responses to violent and coercive challenges that
typified the  Carter administration, the  manipulative character of  public
policy was  not  significantly modified. The  Reagan administration’s
principal contributions to  defense  and  foreign policy consisted of  the
Strategic Defense Initiative and the so-called “Reagan Doctrine,” by which
the United States would provide military assistance to Third World anti-
communist insurgents. Both policies merely recapitulated and to a large
extent extended the hedonistic and cosmopolitan manipulative techniques
of the regime. The SDI program dramatically enlarged the role and power
of technical and managerial skills in the defense community, and neither
SDI  nor  the  Reagan Doctrine  involved any  significant attenuation of
managerial hedonism and cosmopolitanism through an  appeal to
postponement of gratification or deference to national solidarity. Indeed,
both programs enhanced the soft managerial ethic by promising security
against perceived threats without personal risk and sacrifice and through
technological and  foreign surrogates. The  administration did  use  force
against Grenada (1983) and Libya (1986), but the level and duration of the

coercion was not sufficient to invoke a sustained ideological challenge to
the soft managerial ethic, nor were the brief and much-glorified expeditions
against Panama  and  Iraq  under President Bush  in  1990  and  1991.  The
Reagan administration used a rhetoric of toughness and employed economic
sanctions and covert interventions against small or weak opponents, but it
took  no  serious coercive or  punitive  measures against terrorism  and  its
foreign state  sponsors, against  perceived pro-Soviet movements and
governments in  Central America,  or  against the  Soviet Union in  the
aftermath of the lethal Soviet attack on Korean Air Lines Flight 007. Its ill-
conceived Iran-Contra scandal originated in  an  apparent effort  to
manipulate the release of hostages held by terrorists through negotiations
with the Iranian state sponsors of the terrorists. Although drug smuggling
and  crimes associated with  illegal and  dangerous drugs increased
dramatically in  the  Reagan era  and  though the  administration sizably
increased the  budgets and  personnel of  drug  enforcement programs and
agencies, these efforts too avoided any major or protracted use of coercion
against the  criminal challenge and  tended to  rely  on  manipulative
(educational and  therapeutic), managerial, bureaucratic, and  diplomatic
responses. Despite  some concession to  the  use  of  force  and  the
manipulation of patriotic sentiments in foreign affairs, the Reagan era saw
no  significant departure from  typical soft  managerial responses and
ideological and behavioral patterns.
If the soft managerial elite cannot respond with effective force to violent
criminal and external challenges, neither is it able to resolve the psychic and
social challenges that develop from the erosion of cultural and national
solidarity.  The  disintegration of  social bonds under the  impact of
managerial acceleration and the mobility, affluence, urbanization, and social
change associated with the revolution of mass and scale have fragmented

the  traditional, religious, moral,  and  social authorities and  sources of
meaning and value in the managerial regime. “Loss of community,” writes
## Robert Nisbet,
isolates man, and the mounting pressure of vast institutions and organizations, far from
shoring up his being, only intensifies the alienative process: by fragmenting him into the
mechanical roles he is forced to play, none of them touching his innermost self but all of
them separating man from this self, leaving him, so to speak, existentially missing in
action. . . . In this perspective, modern society is inaccessible because of its remoteness,
formidable from its heavy structures of organization, meaningless from its impersonal
complexity. . . . Mass opinion succeeds the discipline of taste and judgment; the harsh and
stunting disciplines of the factory succeed the rhythms of countryside; rationalization of
society degenerates into  regimentation; and  the  primary values of  European culture—
honor,  loyalty,  friendship—are seen  as  withering away  under the  dead  weight of
objectification.
## [608]
“Man’s feeling of homelessness, of alienation,” writes William Barrett,
“has been intensified in the midst of a bureaucratized, impersonal mass
society. He has come to feel himself an outsider even within his own human
society.”
## [609]
The  manipulative skills  and  material rewards of  the  soft  managerial
regime and its ethic of hedonism and cosmopolitanism have been unable
either to restore traditional authorities or to formulate new ones that can
satisfy human psychic and social needs or provide a coherent and enduring
public orthodoxy that legitimizes obedience, social and political cohesion,
the postponement of gratification, the acceptance of sacrifice and suffering,
and loyalty to concrete and particular institutions. The “open society” ideal
of  the  soft  elite,  allowing it  to  sanction and  subvert non-  and  anti-
managerial authorities and values and to manipulate and accelerate ideas
and values that enhance its own dominance, prevents the formulation or
enforcement of  an  ascetic and  solidarist orthodoxy that  could  satisfy
psychic and  social needs in  ways  that  technocratic, hedonistic, and
cosmopolitan ideologies cannot. The  soft  managerial regime, in  its

ideological illusion  that  human beings are  creatures of  their  social  and
historical environment and  can  be  ameliorated through the  managed
manipulation of the environment, has only dispersed authority and values
and sought to manipulate their fragments. The soft elite does not recognize
—and cannot recognize, given its worldview and the material and political
interests on  which its  worldview is  based—that immutable elements of
human nature constrain the  possibilities of  amelioration and  necessitate
attachment to the concrete social and historical roots of moral values and
meaning, at the expense of the mythologies of cosmopolitan dispersion and
hedonistic indulgence.
The result of the psychic and social vacuum created by the soft elite and
of its inability to fill the vacuum is the fragmentation of the subordinate
society into forces and groups that the regime finds difficult to discipline or
unify.  In  the  late  1970s, Kevin Phillips noted  what  he  called “The
Balkanization of America”:
Throughout the  1970s  the  symptoms of  decomposition appeared throughout the  body
politic—in the economic, geographic, ethnic, religious, cultural, biological components of
our  society.  Small  loyalties have  been  replacing larger  ones.  Small  views  have  been
replacing larger ones.
[T]he Balkanization of America is closely related to what Andrew Hacker has called “the
end  of  the  American era.”  Can  it  be  coincidental that  U.S.  political and  social
decomposition accelerated with our exit from Vietnam and the end of Pax Americana, the
concurrent failure of the Great Society, the end of energy abundance, the downfall of
cultural optimism, and—of course—Watergate  and  public loss  of  confidence in  the
political system? On the contrary, the breakdown of these unities, hopes and glories has
been  enough to  send  Americans, too,  scrambling after  less  exalting forms of  self-
identification: ethnicity, regionalism, selfish economic interests, sects and neighborhoods.
## [610]
Phillips identified several manifestations of national decomposition—
regional conflicts between “Sunbelt” and  “Frostbelt” over  regulation of
energy and natural resources; conflicts among “biological fragments” of
sex, sexual orientation, age, race, and ethnicity; cultural fragmentation in

the  affirmation of  regional and  subcultural distinctiveness; and  political
fragmentation in the decline of party disciplines, the emergence of virtually
independent fiefdoms in Congress and the executive and judicial branches,
and the assertion of state, intra-state, and local identities and interests. Other
and somewhat later manifestations of decomposition include the emergence
of Christian fundamentalism and the political movements associated with it
as well as cults, pseudo-sciences, religious sects, millenarian movements,
occultist and extremist groups, and other marginal movements manifesting
forms  of  social  irrationalism that  provide emotional and  organizational
surrogates for  a  coherent social order  and  its  institutional and  moral
canopies.
Other fragments that emerged in the following decade were particularly
associated with  racial  and  ethnic identity.  The  intensification of  racial
themes was apparent among blacks in the presidential campaigns of Jesse
Jackson in  1984  and  1988;  the  bitter  conflicts over  apparently racially-
motivated homicides in the Howard Beach and Bensonhurst communities in
New York City; the controversies over Tawana Brawley and construction of
desegregated public housing in Yonkers, New York; mass demonstrations
and counter-demonstrations in white-dominated Forsyth County, Georgia,
in 1986; the enactment of legislation in 1983 establishing the birthday of
Martin Luther King,  Jr.  as  a  federal public holiday; black  demands for
elimination of Confederate Civil  War  flags  and  monuments and  (with
Asians and Hispanics) for changes in academic curricula to reflect non-
European cultural traditions and  values; and  black  support for  punitive
sanctions on South Africa. Racial themes were apparent in the presidential
campaigns of both political parties in 1988.
Ethnic and racial fragmentation was evident also in the entry of 8 to 9

million legal  (and  additional illegal) immigrants into  the  United States
between 1981 and 1990, a number equal to or greater than the largest wave
of immigration in American history between 1901 and 1910. Nearly 85
percent of  the  new  immigrants were  from Asia  or  Latin America, and
demographer Leon Bouvier predicted that whites would become a minority
in California, Texas, and New York within 20 to 24 years. Time magazine
predicted in 1990 that “By 2056 . . . the ‘average’ U.S. resident, as defined
by  Census  statistics, will  trace  his  or  her  descent to  Africa, Asia,  the
Hispanic world, the Pacific Islands, Arabia—almost anywhere but white
## Europe.”
## [611]
The mass immigration deposited new fragments in the United
States that challenged national unity by their racial, cultural, linguistic, and
religious distinctiveness and  precipitated a  reactive racial  consciousness
among other Americans, white as well as black. Organized criminal groups
—drug cartels, street gangs, and motorcycle gangs—composed of Asian,
Jamaican, black American, Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Colombian elements
and  using  ethnic, kinship, and  religious bonds also  appeared as  other
cultural fragments. In California two immense street gangs, the “Crips” and
the “Bloods,” with some 70,000 members waged war on each other with
sophisticated weaponry and  developed satellite groups and  alliances in
other parts of the country.
Racial and  ethnic fragmentation was  an  important element  in  the
emergence  of  post-bourgeois  resistance to  the  managerial regime  in  the
1960s. In the 1970s Michael Novak discovered the persistence of ethnicity
among descendants of Eastern and Southern European immigrants, their
resentment of the “culture of the American professional elites, with its high
emphasis on specialization, objectivity, and technical proficiency,” and their
“disillusionment with  the  universalist, too  thinly rational culture of
professional elites.”
## [612]
xvi Novak noted European ethnic support for George

Wallace, and middle-income white ethnics were prominent in the Howard
Beach and Yonkers controversies. In the 1970s and 1980s, southern white
consciousness developed through country-Western music, popular culture,
sectionalism, and defense of Confederate monuments and public display of
the Confederate flag. In the 1980s an explicitly violent, neo-Nazi movement
appeared in the Far West, with cognate groups in other parts of the country,
and later in the decade “skinhead” youth cults espoused racialist ideological
themes. Hostility  to  black, Jewish, Hispanic, and Asian  groups and  an
affirmation of white racial identity and cultural heritage were prominent
elements in these movements.
Yet fragmentation and decomposition are not confined to subordinate
social forces. Within the soft elite itself fissures have appeared that threaten
its own unity as a dominant social force. In the 1980s the organizational
ethic  that  William H.  Whyte described in  the  1950s appeared  to  be
dissipating among corporate managers. Younger managers disdained
lifelong service to the corporation and sought their own self-interest, even
in violation of regulatory law. In the political elite, cases of corruption,
conflicts of  interest, espionage, and  whistle-blowing threatened the
functioning of the managerial state. Unlike much of the fragmentation that
appeared among subordinate social  forces, however,  the  corruption and
undisguised pursuit of  self-interest within the  elite  were  not  reactions
against managerial dominance but extreme fulfillments of the hedonistic
and cosmopolitan ethic itself. Unrestrained by institutional loyalties, group
solidarity, and moral barriers, ambitious and upwardly-mobile members of
the  managerial elite  saw  no  reason to  limit  their  personal pursuit of
immediate gratification. Contrary to Daniel Bell’s belief in the 1970s that a
stable “disjunction” of behavioral styles in work and leisure was possible—
that one could be “‘straight’ by day and a ‘swinger’ by night”
## [613]
xvii—the

indulgent, manipulative, and  dispersive ethic  of  the  elite  threatened to
weaken and undermine the coherence of the elite itself.
The prevalence of corruption is a direct result of the Class I psychic and
behavioral patterns that prevail within the soft elite and loosen attachment
to group identities and disciplines and of the dependence of the elite on
cosmopolitan and  hedonistic formulas that  are  incompatible with  the
subordination of  private to  public and  national interests and  are  indeed
difficult  to  reconcile with  any  definition of  such  interests. Hence, the
regime is  unable to  formulate coherent ideological prohibitions of
corruption, whether in the strictly legalistic sense of criminal abuses by
public officials or in the broader sense of the displacement of the public
good by private interests. The social and cultural fragmentation within the
elite often takes the form of such corruption in such common practices as
bribery, conflicts of interest, violations of professional and public codes of
ethics, sexual scandals, and political fraud, as well as in legal but morally
dubious and  socially exploitative legislation, corporate policies, and
executive-branch decisions. Yet corruption is not confined to the elite but
extends also  throughout the  subordinate society in  a  general refusal to
sacrifice or defer gratification for the public interest or for any collective or
institutional purpose and in actual denial that such an interest or purpose
exists or, if it does exist, that it exerts any legitimate moral authority. The
tendency is apparent in such common forms as sexual infidelity, cheating in
schools, tax evasion, and petty criminality. While the appearance of such
corruption serves to weaken the functioning and discredit the legitimacy of
the soft managerial regime, the more serious vulnerability that corruption
and  fragmentation represent is  the  progressive erosion of  any  publicly
acknowledged identity,  consensus,  or  ethos  and  the  disappearance of  a
generally accepted foundation for  the  formulation of  societal decisions,

goals, and purposes.
As Phillips noted, “today’s American Balkanization in large measure
represents the failure of these leadership elites to understand the simple
facts  of  race,  ethnicity,  territory,  greed and  inequality.”
## [614]
The  soft
managerial elite, bound by its psychic composition and structural interests
to an ideology and ethic of hedonism and cosmopolitanism, is incapable of
permanently disciplining or  unifying through manipulation and  the  soft
managerial political formulas the interests and sentiments that underlie the
economic, social, cultural, racial, and political fragments that emerged in
the 1970s and 1980s. The contracted structure of the managerial elite, the
prevalence within it of Class I residues that yield a psychic and behavioral
pattern of manipulation, and the dependence of the elite on manipulative
ideology, styles of dominance, and responses to challenges thus constitute a
serious vulnerability of the soft regime. As Pareto argued, the eventual fate
of an elite in which Class I residues have accumulated too heavily is its
collapse before challenges that its ideology does not permit it to recognize
and its behavioral proclivities and apparatus of power do not permit it to
resolve successfully. It is hardly coincidental that at the apogee of the soft
managerial regime in the 1980s its most intractable challenges appeared in
the  form  of  international terrorism and  internal criminal violence
perpetrated by alien elements organized in sizable transnational cartels and
internal gangs or that forces asserting racial or ethnic solidarism emerged as
fragments of  the  subordinate society. The  organizational vehicles  of  the
criminal and  terrorist challenges sometimes made  use  of  managerial
techniques, and the leadership that emerged within them in some respects
resembled the elites of the hard managerial regimes, which in some cases
allied with and supported these criminal and terrorist movements. The soft
regime, however,  appeared unable to  respond to  these  challenges by

appropriate force or by asserting sufficient national solidarity to exclude
alien criminal elements from its boundaries.
The appearance in the 1980s of challenges to which the soft regime
seemed to have no adequate response suggests the accuracy of Pareto’s
prediction that elites in which Class I residues prevail would be displaced
by emergent elites in which Class II residues are dominant and which can
more easily respond to challenges of violence and the erosion of social
authority. The soft managerial regime exhibits an extreme polarization of
residues, with those of Class I concentrated within the elite and those of
Class II concentrated in the mass population and isolated from social power
and  public decision-making. Lacking sufficient Class  II  residues, the
incumbent elite has neither the ideological nor the psychic and behavioral
resources with which to respond to challenges that assert group solidarity,
are willing to use violence and accept risk and sacrifice, and cannot be
assimilated or manipulated by the routines on which mass organizations in
the soft regime depend. Nor, because of the structural interests of the soft
elite, can it adapt its disciplines to accommodate such fragments adequately.
The power, status, and social rewards of the soft elite are bound to the
managerial and technical skills that manage social, economic, and cultural
manipulation. Adaptation of  these  skills  and  the  apparatus  of  mass
organizations centered around them to respond to the solidarist challenges
and fragmentations of the last two decades would necessarily involve a
radical circulation of  the  soft  elite  and  the  transformation of  the  soft
managerial regime into a hard regime.
Neither the fragmentation and decomposition evident in the subordinate
society nor that of the elite necessarily foreshadows the collapse of the soft
managerial regime, however, and not all of the fragments are inassimilable.

Many of the cults, marginal movements, and economic fragments that have
recently emerged,  despite their  professions of  radicalism and  non-
conformity,  replicate  the  psychic and  ideological patterns of  the  elite
through their own formulas of emancipation and amelioration and through
the  purportedly  esoteric (but  in  fact  easily accessible) knowledge and
technique that  they  propagate. Because they  share the  psychic
characteristics and ideological premises of the elite, they are compatible
with the structures and disciplines of the soft regime and do not constitute a
serious challenge to it. Through their participation in the mass cultural and
economic organizations and their access to the rewards of the regime, they
are often easily assimilated within its apparatus of control. Such fragments,
far from challenging the incumbent elite and its apparatus, actually serve to
enhance managerial dominance by contributing to the illusions of openness,
liberation, and progress that managerial ideology articulates, by their own
challenges to  non-managerial institutions and  values, and  by  their
absorption of  anti-managerial elements that  are  potentially capable of
asserting more genuinely radical challenges.
Moreover, in addition to their psychic and ideological compatibility with
the elite, many of the fragments that have so far appeared continue to rely
on the organizational functions and goods and services provided by the
managerial economy,  state,  and  mass  organizations of  culture and
communication and  remain at  least  partially assimilated within the
apparatus of social control. Until such managerial functions are seriously
impaired (by economic depression, for example, war, insurrection, or the
extreme disintegration of discipline) or until a non-managerial alternative to
mass-organizational functions is developed, there is little real prospect for
the  end  of  the  soft  regime. While the  regime appears to  be  unable to
confront or  resolve such  challenges as  fragmentation presents  or  the

challenge of  fragmentation itself,  it  retains the  capacity to  distract and
manipulate many of  the  disintegrating components and  to  avoid a
breakdown of  the  regime for  an  indefinite period. A  concerted anti-
managerial challenge to the regime, mobilizing and unifying subordinate
Class  II  residues and  the  accumulated resentments and  hostilities of
resistant social forces and  articulating an  ideology of  solidarism and
asceticism, could override the  manipulative routines and  selective
assimilation of the soft elite and displace it as a socially dominant minority.
But in the later part of the 1980s only the rudimentary forms of such a
challenge were apparent. While the polarization of residues and the mental
and behavioral patterns associated with them destabilizes the soft regime
and  represents a  serious vulnerability of  it,  the  polarization does  not
necessarily indicate an immediate circulation and displacement of residues
within the elite.
Nevertheless, the tendency of the subordinate society to fragmentation
and decomposition and the emergence of anti-managerial movements reveal
the inadequacy of the disciplines and routines of the managerial regime and
the  vulnerabilities  of  the  soft  elite  that  predominates within it. Yet  the
inadequacies of  the  regime appear clearly only  from  the  perspective of
those subordinate social forces that do not share and are alienated from
managerial routines and ideology. From the perspective of the soft elite
itself,  much  of  the  social disintegration is  not  only  conducive to  the
enhancement of its power and social rewards—by creating social problems
and  breakdowns, disintegration provides an  opportunity for  the  further
application of  managerial skills—but also  appears as  a  progressive and
liberating process. The cosmopolitan and hedonistic worldview of the elite
depicts the dispersion of group solidarity and institutional constraints as a
release of human potentials from a repressive, irrational, and obsolete social

and historical environment, though most adherents of this worldview do not
perceive their own conformity to and disciplining by the routines of mass
organizations as confining. The perspective of the elite is not formed only
by  its  structural  interests and  the  ideas  that  rationalize these  interests,
however, but reflects the prevalence of Class I residues within its psychic
and behavioral composition. Indeed, the entire structure and composition of
the soft managerial elite compel it to pursue strategies of dominance that
encourage the fragmentation and eventual destruction or extinction of the
society it rules.
In this respect, the soft managerial elite appears to be virtually unique in
human history. Almost all elites and ruling classes of the past have acquired
strong interests in preserving the social, economic, political, and cultural
institutions on which their own power, wealth, and status were founded.
Hence, most elites of the past have been conservative in the ideas, values,
and  policies they  have  supported. While the  soft  managerial elite  is
conservative in the sense that it seeks to preserve and extend the base of its
power in  the  mass  organizations of  the  state,  economy,  and  culture, its
functions and dominance within this organizational base are derived from
its  proficiency in  skills  that  manage, manipulate, and  accelerate social
change, and its apparatus of power in the mass organizations expands its
dominance through the erosion of compact and autonomous institutions in
which managerial skills  have  little  application or  value. Moreover,  the
apparatus of mass organizations is fused or bound together not by the social
bonds and disciplines of the subordinate society but, in part, by its own
routines that regulate the thought and behavior of those assimilated within
it;  in  part,  by  the  legal  bonds and  relationships that  regulate the
interdependence of the state, the economy, and the culture; and perhaps in
major part by the bonds imposed by the physical and social technology of

mass organizations. The  scientific, technical, administrative, and
bureaucratic skills, knowledge, and procedures involved in the operation
and direction of these technologies impose or select for a uniformity of
mentality and behavior as well as of function that radically differentiates the
soft  managerial elite  from  non-managerial social groups and  forces,
alienates the elite from the subordinate society, and binds it together as a
supra-cultural and supra-national social force that is hostile to subordinate
society. The soft managerial elite not only does not need the subordinate
society for its own functioning and cohesion but also dislikes it and seeks
its extinction.
The  tastes, codes of  comportment, and  life-styles of  what David
Lebedoff  has  called “The New  Elite,”  the  members of  which “are  the
managers of  society—teachers,  commentators, planners, officials, and
executives—the articulators of  thoughts and  standards” and  who  gain
access to  the  elite  through proficiency in  “professional, verbal, or
technocratic skills,” reflect the alienation and hostility of the elite toward
the subordinate society and its values as well as the elites of the past and
their codes and standards. The distinctive feature of the codes by which the
“New Elite” identifies itself is “the rejection of traditional values.”
Millions of Americans today begin their adult lives with furious erasures. . . . In an age of
marked social and economic mobility, of the disintegration of neighborhoods, of quick and
frequent changes in  the  places people live,  of  the  erosion of  the  most  basic  “root”
institutions—family and church—it is for an increasing number of people no longer even a
question of rejecting roots: it is a matter of never having acquired roots in the first place. If
people derive their identity from the positions to which their measured intelligence has
taken them, it is perhaps because there are few alternative sources from which they can
define that identity at all.
## [615]
Lebedoff’s “New Elite,” of course, is the soft managerial elite, which
appears newer than it is because the consolidation of the organizational base
of its social power after World War II has allowed it to evolve a more

distinctive identity in the last two decades. The rejection of “roots” and
“traditional [i.e., bourgeois or non-managerial] values” by which the elite
defines its identity is an extension of its cosmopolitanism and its psychic
and behavioral type, but it is also an instrument of social conflict by which
the elite legitimizes its own dominance and delegitimizes the values and
ideas of non- or anti-managerial groups and those who adhere to them—in
Lebedoff’s  terms, the  “Left  Behinds,” whose “work does  not  require
professional, verbal, or technocratic skills” and who include “most small
businessmen, retailers, manufacturers, manual and  clerical workers, and
salespeople. In a large corporation, the top executives and the assembly line
workers are typically Left Behinds, and the upper-middle ranks—analysts,
lawyers, researchers—belong to the New Elite.”
## [616]
With the exception of
top corporate executives, who in fact do occupy their positions because of
managerial skills and who increasingly adhere to the codes and life-styles of
the “New Elite,” most of the other categories of “Left Behinds” are part of
the post-bourgeois proletariat.
The  interests, ideology,  psychic and  behavioral type,  and  life-styles
characteristic of the soft managerial elite thus alienate it from and drive it
into conflict with the remnants of pre-managerial society and its elites and
with the social and cultural identities that persist in the subordinate society.
In the 1980s, with the diffusion of new technologies of information and
communication that  allow for  immediate global transmission and
integration, and further challenge and disperse these identities, the nation-
state  itself  and  the  national identity of  its  citizens were  beginning to
decompose into  a  new  transnational or  global managerial regime that
transcends national boundaries and  disintegrates national and  cultural
distinctions. Zbigniew Brzezinski, recognizing in the 1970s the impending
extinction of pre-managerial society organized in nation-states and compact

social institutions and commenting on the evolution of what he called “a
planetary consciousness,” noted  the  differentiation of  the  increasingly
global managerial elite  from  the  mass  populations of  the  subordinate
societies within nation-states.
Today we are again witnessing the emergence of transnational elites, but now they are
composed of international businessmen, scholars, professional men, and public officials.
The ties of these new elites cut across national boundaries, their perspectives are not
confined by national traditions, and their interests are more functional than national. These
global communities are gaining in strength and, as was true in the Middle Ages, it is likely
that  before  long  the  social  elites  of  most  of  the  advanced countries will  be  highly
internationalist or globalist in spirit and outlook. The creation of the global information
grid, facilitating almost continuous intellectual interaction and the pooling of knowledge,
will further enhance the present trend toward international professional elites and toward
the emergence of a common scientific language (in effect, the functional equivalent of
Latin). This, however, could create a dangerous gap between them and the politically
activated masses, whose “nativism”—exploited by  more  nationalist political leaders—
could work against the “cosmopolitan” elites.
## [617]
The tendency toward managerial globalism, apparent in the international
policies of the developed Western states since the 1930s, is manifested in
the technological and organizational integration of a “global economy” and
the  economic “interdependence” of  nations and  regions; in  the
internationalization of populations through mass migrations from the Third
World  into  Western Europe and  North America; and  in  the  gradual
supersession of  the  legal  and  political bases  of  the  nation-state  and  its
independence through the  adaptation of  national laws  and  policies to
international laws, agreements, and organizations involving the control of
narcotics, crime, and  terrorism,  the  protection of  the  environment and
natural resources as  well  as  regulation of  the  “global economy” and
immigrants and  refugees, the  punishment of  genocide, the  control of
nuclear and unconventional arms, the enforcement of peace by international
peace-keeping forces, multinational aid for victims of famine and natural
disasters, and the use of multinational sanctions and penalties against states
that reject or resist the new global regime and its mandates. The global

regime—the “New World  Order” of  President Bush’s  rhetoric—is
rationalized through the intensification of managerial cosmopolitanism and
its cultural repercussions in an increasingly internationalized cuisine, styles
of dress, language, and mass media of entertainment and information as
well as in religious, philosophical, and ethical ecumenism and syncretism.
The elite of the new global managerial regime presides over, welcomes,
and  accelerates the  dispersion of  the  cultural, legal,  political, military,
economic, and  demographic distinctions that  define nationality,  and  it
regards the persistence of national pre-eminence and power, economic or
political, as at best an anachronism and a barrier to the complete emergence
of the global order. The goal of administering the dispersion of national
power and  subordinating it  to  the  emergent  global order  under the
management of the elite is implicit in Professor Paul Kennedy’s thesis that
the United States has entered the twilight of its status as a world power:
The task facing American statesmen over the next decades, therefore, is to recognize that
broad trends are under way, and that there is a need to “manage” affairs so that the relative
erosion of  the  United States’  position takes  place  slowly and  smoothly,  and  is  not
accelerated by  policies which bring  merely short-term advantage but  longer-term
disadvantage. . . . In all of the discussions about the erosion of American leadership, it
needs to be repeated again and again that the decline referred to is relative not absolute,
and is therefore perfectly natural; and that the only serious threat to the real interests of the
United States can come from a failure to adjust sensibly to the newer world order.
## [618]
The managed erosion of the political and economic pre-eminence of the
United States and of other nation-states is a prerequisite for the parallel
management of the erosion of the cultural and demographic identities of
nations and  their  assimilation into  a  global managerial apparatus. The
decline of  national power and  the  erosion of  cultural identity does  not
threaten the power of the managerial elite but enhances it by reducing the
constraints on its power, accelerating the disengagement of the elite from
subordinate societies, and encouraging the global merging of the managerial

elites  of  distinct nations and  cultures into  an  increasingly autonomous,
transnational, global social force. The emergent global elite can be expected
to form alliances with the new immigrant underclasses and racial fragments
in the developed states and with the local managerial elites of Third World
states  to  challenge both  the  domestic institutional barriers  to  further
managerial integration as well as the national, racial, cultural, and historical
identities of nation-states themselves. The elite can thus exploit the racial
fragmentation and polarization of the 1980s to enhance its own power and
overcome resistant social forces and institutions on an intra-national as well
as a global scale. While independent nation-states may persist as formal
legal  and  geographical entities, the  differentiation and  merging  of  their
managerial elites into a transnationally integrated unit distinct from and in
conflict with subordinate society and the assimilation of nations, cultures,
and populations into a global managerial regime mean that Western nation-
states  will  cease  to  exist  as  meaningful objects of  political loyalty and
cultural identity and that the majority of their historic population groups
will  increasingly endure the  traumatizing and  potentially radicalizing
experiences of  social destruction, national decomposition and
fragmentation, political alienation, and cultural dispossession.
Despite the success of the soft managerial regime in generating mass
affluence and  scientific and  technological achievements, its  ability to
organize mass  populations and  social interactions, and  its  capacity to
assimilate and manipulate seemingly insuperable challenges and problems,
the regime is inherently fragile and vulnerable. Its monolithic concentration
of political, economic, and cultural power under a single, uniform social
force insulates it from the restraining power of other forces outside the elite
and renders its social dominance a danger to their interests and aspirations.
The uniformity of its elite excludes from power and social rewards those

non-managerial forces that might broaden the range of resources, talents,
skills, ideas, and psychic and behavioral types from which the regime could
draw  in  responding to  challenges, and  the  resulting contraction of  the
regime limits its capacity to meet challenges successfully. The contraction
of the regime also contributes to the impersonal, abstract, technocratic, and
dehumanized quality of  its  style  of  dominance, and  its  tendency to
encourage homogenization, standardization, and  mass routinization
alienates and  frustrates subordinate society.  Its  imperative for  social
destruction weakens the  subordinate society and  encourages its
fragmentation into forces that managerial routinization cannot effectively
control. The  prevalence within the  regime of  a  single psychic and
behavioral type predisposed to manipulation restricts its capacity to meet
challenges to  manipulative and  assimilative responses, which are
inadequate in resolving the processes of decomposition and unifying the
subordinate social order.  Despite the  totalitarian intrusion of  its
manipulative techniques and routines, the regime exhibits an inability to
enforce its  disciplines for  the  unification and  cohesion of  the  society it
dominates. Almost miraculously,  it  seems, the  soft  regime has
institutionalized tyranny and anarchy simultaneously.
These vulnerabilities  of  the  soft  managerial regime derive from  the
structure and  composition of  its  elite,  not  from  individual personalities,
disembodied ideas, or historical abstractions. The need of the soft elite to
enhance its power through the continuous, managed acceleration of social
change, its reliance on managerial and technical skills and their applications
to  social  arrangements, and  the  prevalence within the  elite  of  Class  I
residues that  impel  it  toward manipulation rather  than  coercion  and  a
cosmopolitan and hedonistic ideology rather than one of solidarism and
asceticism are the structural elements that account for the behavior of the

elite and the weaknesses of the regime it has created and dominates.
The vulnerabilities of the soft managerial regime and the appearance in
recent years  of  fragmentary forces  that  present challenges to  which the
regime is  unable to  respond  satisfactorily raise  questions about the
prospects of  the  survival of  the  regime in  the  future. While some
fragmentation presents no  serious  threat  to  the  managerial apparatus of
power, is easily deflected or assimilated by it, or actually serves to enhance
its dominance, other fragments may issue more significant challenges. Not
only violent criminal and terrorist groups, in which Class II residues prevail
to a pathological degree, but also social, political, and intellectual forces
that question the basic ideological formulas and symbols that legitimize the
regime and its dominance, are beginning to emerge. The major such force is
the post-bourgeois proletariat, which the regime alienates through its social
destruction, manipulation, and cultural dispossession, and in which Class II
residues of  “group persistence” and  their  ideological correlates of
solidarism and asceticism are strong.
Although the  managerial regime  effectively decapitated the  post-
bourgeois political challenges in the 1970s and 1980s, it did not resolve the
sources of fragmentation, alienation, and conflict that generated them and
other anti-managerial or disintegrative forces. The soft regime appears to be
unable to arrest or resolve the process of fragmentation itself, although it
may be able to manipulate and assimilate many of the specific fragments.
Since the 1960s, however, when anti-managerial forces on the left and right
temporarily destabilized the regime and provoked a protracted crisis within
it, the regime has been unable to consolidate its power, assimilate alienated
post-bourgeois forces successfully, and pursue a strategy of acceleration.
Yet the regime remains wedded to its role as the agent of the revolution

of the 20th century through its encouragement of the processes of social
fragmentation and  national decomposition and  through its  continuous
conflict with  and  war  against not  only  compact and  autonomous social
institutions that function by means of non-managerial and non-technical
disciplines but also the national organization and cultural loyalties of the
mass  populations. The  result of  managerial social destruction and
globalization is the destabilization of autonomous institutions, the social
uprooting and cultural dispossession of their members, the dispersion of
non-managerial norms, and the alienation of those groups that have been
imperfectly assimilated within the  disciplines of  the  soft  regime. The
emergence of  a  significant anti-managerial social force  in  the  post-
bourgeois proletariat, which adheres to fragmented and rootless elements of
bourgeois  ideology and  is  deeply alienated from  and  hostile to  the
managerial elite,  is  a  natural consequence of  the  assault on  social
institutions and national and cultural norms by the regime and represents
perhaps the most serious challenge to it that has yet appeared.
While post-bourgeois groups remain attached to the regime through the
economic goods  and  services it  provides, their  discontent with  and
resentment of the manipulative social deracination that the regime inflicts,
the  alien  content of  its  cosmopolitan and  hedonistic ideology that
challenges their own fragmented bourgeois ethos, and their own exclusion
from the elite and their inability to restrain or modify the concentrated and
expanding dominance of  the  regime prevent their  stable  and  permanent
assimilation into it and their acceptance of its legitimacy. If the material
functions performed by the regime were to fail, post-bourgeois alienation
could  evolve a  revolutionary consciousness organized in  a  social and
political movement that the regime could no longer contain, discipline, or
manipulate and  which could  lead  to  the  destruction or  radical

transformation of the soft regime.

Toward a Post-Bourgeois Revolution
Discussing the genesis of civilizations that emerge out of historically
preceding civilizations, Arnold J. Toynbee argued that “the principal and
essential challenge [that initiated their birth] was a human challenge arising
out of their relationship to the society to which they were affiliated. This
challenge is  implicit in  the  relation itself, which begins with  a
differentiation and culminates in a secession.”
The differentiation takes place within the body of the antecedent civilization, when that
civilization begins to lose the creative power through which, in its period of growth, it had
at one time inspired a voluntary allegiance in the hearts of the people below its surface or
beyond its borders. When this happens, the ailing civilization pays the penalty for its
failing vitality by being disintegrated into a dominant minority, which rules with increasing
oppressiveness but  no  longer leads, and  a  proletariat (internal and  external) which
responds to the challenge by becoming conscious that it has a soul of its own and by
making up its mind to save its soul alive. The dominant minority’s will to repress evokes in
the proletariat a will to secede; and a conflict between these two wills continues while the
declining civilization verges  towards its  fall,  until,  when  it  is in  articulo mortis,  the
proletariat at length breaks free from what was once its spiritual home but now has become
a prison-house and finally a City of Destruction.
## [619]
If Toynbee’s model is applied to the contemporary conflicts within the
United States (and  to  at  least  some  degree in  other  economically and
technologically developed states), it should be evident that the role of the
“dominant minority” is filled by the elite of the soft managerial regime.
Unable to  consolidate its  power securely but  wedded to  continuing
acceleration, the soft managerial elite has failed to produce the managerial
civilization that its worldview and its technical skills seemed to promise,
despite the unsurpassed material and technological accomplishments these
skills have  created. Relying on  manipulative responses to  societal
challenges, the elite has successfully perpetuated its dominance but has not
been  able  to  formulate a  myth  of  legitimacy that  would prevent or  re-

integrate the  social  and  cultural  fragmentation that  its  manipulation and
acceleration generate. Some of these fragments can be integrated into the
soft regime only through their dependence on the material functions the
regime provides,  but  they  reject  both  the  traditional bourgeois  and  the
relatively new  soft  managerial ideologies intended as  formulas of
legitimization, and  their  acceptance of  managerial dominance is  largely
contingent on the capacity of the regime to continue providing its material
functions as a form of grand bribery.
The result has been a protracted crisis in which the soft regime is unable
either to consolidate and legitimize its power in enduring institutions or to
accelerate its  manipulation of  social institutions and  interactions in
accordance with the needs and interests of its elite. This crisis has led to the
transformation of  the  soft  elite  into  one  of  Toynbee’s  “dominant
minorities.” The soft managerial elite is ceasing to provide leadership and is
failing to  respond adequately to  the  challenges it  encounters. It  relies
increasingly on the technical and managerial manipulation of hedonistic
themes to distract subordinate social forces from the material and psycho-
social crises that are emerging, and it is encountering coercive challenges
from hostile Class II residues that cannot be resolved through manipulation.
Its  manipulation weakens and  disperses traditional social bonds,
institutions, and  ideologies, and,  through its  continuous management of
social change, its cosmopolitan ethic and ideology, and its transnational
scope, the  soft  regime prevents the  formation of  new  bonds  that  could
provide psychic and  social  stability through new  myths of  cultural and
national solidarity and new institutional resources through which challenges
could be met and resolved. Through its mechanisms of mass consumption
and  entertainment  and  the  mass  routinization of  cultural life,  the  soft
managerial elite dispossesses and alienates the subordinate social forces of

the regime. The elite, in the perception of the alienated groups, “rules with
increasing oppressiveness but no longer leads.”
If  the  soft  managerial elite  constitutes one  of  Toynbee’s  “dominant
minorities,” then  the  alienated fragments into  which the  social  order  is
decomposing constitute his “internal proletariat.” Toynbee did not use this
term  in  the  sense  of  Karl  Marx  and  his  followers,  an  urban  laboring
population employed under the industrial capitalist economic system and
economically immiserated and oppressed by the ruling capitalist class, but
rather in the sense of “any social element or group which in some way is in
but not of any given society at any period of that society’s history.”
## [620]
“Proletarianism,” wrote Toynbee, “is a state of feeling rather than a matter
of outward circumstance. . . . The true hall-mark of the proletarian is neither
poverty nor humble birth but a consciousness—and the resentment that this
consciousness inspires—of being disinherited from his ancestral place in
society.”
## [621]
Performance of  physical labor  and  economic immiseration,
then, are not essential attributes of Toynbee’s “proletariat,” as they are of
the same term in the usage of Marx; but alienation—being “in but not of” a
society—is an essential characteristic of it.
Writing in the 1930s, Toynbee argued that the “internal proletariat” of
the  modern Western world consisted of  the  black  population, which
provided physical labor for Western economies, and the “intelligentsia,”
which in several respects resembled the then-emerging managerial elites.
Himself a product of the bourgeois order, Toynbee correctly saw the new
class of managers as a source of disaffection and conflict that would seek to
displace the bourgeois regime that created it. He did not anticipate that in
the United States the new “civilization” formed by the internal proletariat of
the  managerial “intelligentsia” would  prove  to  be  abortive, nor  did  he

foresee what new proletarian forces would emerge in reaction to the new
elite once it had evolved into a “dominant minority.” In fact, Toynbee’s
Western internal proletariats of  non-white workers and  managerial
intellectuals formed an alliance to challenge the bourgeois order and initiate
a  new  regime in  its  place. While  Toynbee’s  concept of  an  “internal
proletariat” remains useful and applicable to the current social order, that
order  is  a  different  one—managerial rather  than  bourgeois—from what
Toynbee knew and analyzed.
Blacks and other non-white racial groups have largely retained the status
of  an  internal proletariat in  the  soft  managerial regime and  exhibit
considerable alienation from  it,  despite their  acquisition of  political
leverage through  their  alliance with  the  soft  elite  against bourgeois  and
post-bourgeois forces. Their alienation is expressed in widespread rejection
of  managerial liberalism and  in  their  attraction to  charismatic  racial-
nationalist leaders who  articulate an  anti-cosmopolitan ideology of  non-
white solidarity, including solidarity with the non-white populations of the
Third World, against European, Jewish, and white American leadership. The
evolution of an anti-managerial consciousness among non-white ethnic and
racial groups remains rudimentary,  however,  largely  because of  the
continuing dependence of  such  groups on  the  economic, legal,
administrative, and political services that the managerial regime provides
them. The logic of non-white proletarian consciousness should point toward
the emergence of an anti-managerial, racially separatist movement, but the
most popular black leader of the 1980s, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, in fact
articulated an ideology of managerial acceleration that merely accepted the
existing structures and functions of the soft regime and sought thereby to
strengthen the  alliance between elite  and  underclass. Since  this  alliance
accounts for most of the political, cultural, and economic significance of the

non-white underclass in the United States, the formation of a non-white
anti-managerial force  that  could  seriously challenge the  incumbent elite
remains unlikely.
The principal internal proletariat of the soft managerial regime today is
the post-bourgeois stratum, which is “in” but not “of” the regime in the
sense that it rejects the cosmopolitan and hedonistic elements of the soft
managerial ideology,  though it  continues to  depend on  the  material
functions of  the  regime, and  also  rejects the  manipulative style  of
dominance and the management of social acceleration on which the soft
elite  depends for  its  power.  The  evolution of  an  anti-managerial post-
bourgeois consciousness has occurred slowly over the last half century. It
accelerated in  the  post-World War  II  era  and  began  to  form  a  political
identity in the 1960s and 1970s in the Wallace movement and the “New
Right,” but these early manifestations were neutralized and assimilated by
the  soft  regime during the  Reagan presidency.  In  the  aftermath  of  the
Reagan era, there are strong indications that the post-bourgeois proletariat is
again evolving an anti-managerial consciousness and ideology and that it
will continue to present a serious, if not insurmountable, challenge to the
soft managerial regime.
The core of the post-bourgeois proletariat consists of what sociologist
Donald I. Warren,  writing in  the  early  1970s, called  “Middle American
Radicals” (MARs), an attitudinal cluster that occupies a lower middle and
working class  position on  the  social  and  economic spectrum and  was
strongly supportive of both the presidential candidacy of George Wallace
and various causes of early New Right activism.
## [622]
Attitudinally, MARs are
defined by their hostility to both the elite and its institutions as well as to
the underclass, and by their characteristic belief that elite and underclass are

in alliance against their own interests and values, which they identify as
American or national interests and values. Although MARs were politically
and culturally active in the 1970s, the Reagan presidency, offering at least
symbolic and rhetorical satisfaction of their aspirations, served to moderate
the militancy of their activism and to integrate them, at least temporarily,
within the managerial political apparatus. Nevertheless, a number of widely
publicized and  controversial events  in  the  1980s indicated that  MAR
resentment of and frustration with the dominant minority were continuing.
Widespread sympathy for  the  New  York  “subway vigilante” Bernhard
Goetz and for whites involved in racial violence in the Howard Beach and
Bensonhurst incidents, as well as white middle class ethnic resistance to
court-ordered residential integration in  Yonkers, New  York,  in  1988,
suggested the persistence and vitality of MAR political consciousness.
While no  political leader or  movement expressing MAR  and  post-
bourgeois aspirations attracted a national following in the 1980s, public
opinion surveys  show  that  these  aspirations continue as  a  latent  but
powerful force in American politics. A Gallup poll conducted for the Times
Mirror Company in 1987 identified several “attitudinal groups” within the
adult population of the United States, including what the survey called the
“Disaffecteds,” who correspond to Warren’s MARs and the post-bourgeois
proletariat. Composing 9 percent of the U.S. adult population and 7 percent
of  the  electorate,  the  “Disaffecteds” are  described by  the  Times  Mirror
survey as “alienated, pessimistic, skeptical of both big government and big
business” and as “middle-aged, middle income, slightly more male than
average,” living in higher numbers in the Midwest, and feeling “significant
personal financial pressure.” The  survey found  the  key  attitudes of  the
Disaffecteds to be “strongly anti-government and anti-business, but pro-
military. Disaffecteds strongly support capital punishment and oppose gun

control. They are divided on abortion. Generally support social spending
unless specifically targeted to minorities. Unemployment and budget deficit
are top concerns.” While Disaffecteds voted Republican by 57 percent in
the 1986 congressional elections and supported Reagan by 69 percent in
1980 and 81 percent in 1984, they differed from other attitudinal groups in
identifying no current or historical public figures as heroes.
## [623]
Despite their
Republican tendencies, however,  the  Disaffecteds remain skeptical of
political candidates in general. A summary of the Times Mirror survey after
the 1988 presidential election found that
The  most  reluctant of  the  Republican-oriented groups were  the  alienated, anti-elitist
Disaffecteds who were evenly divided in their voting intentions in May [1988]. In many
respects, the campaign had its greatest effect on these skeptical voters. By September, their
opinions of Dukakis had moved from luke warm to highly critical and 61% expressed
support for Bush. Ultimately, 68% said they voted for him in the post-election survey.
Compared to other Republican oriented groups, Disaffecteds more often reported voting
“against” Dukakis rather than “for” Bush, and they resembled Democratic defectors in
saying that the issues mattered in voting against Dukakis.
## [624]
While the likelihood of voting among Disaffecteds is “slightly below
average,” another, similar group, the “Moral Republicans,” are more likely
to vote. Composing 11 percent of the adult U.S. population and 14 percent
of the likely electorate, Moral Republicans are by no means as alienated as
the  Disaffecteds, despite the  similarity of  their  demographic profile and
opinions. Moral Republicans also are “middle-aged, middle income,” with a
“heavy concentration of Southerners” and “strong and very conservative
views on social and foreign policy.” They are “strongly anti-abortion, pro-
school prayer,  favor  death  penalty and  quarantine on  AIDS patients,
strongly anti-communist, pro-defense, favor social spending except when it
is targeted to minorities. Deficit and unemployment cited as top concerns.”
Moral Republicans are 94 percent white, regard Reagan and Billy Graham
as  heroes,  live  in  suburbs, small  cities, and  rural  areas, are  regular
churchgoers, and consistently support the Republican Party in congressional

and presidential elections by more than 90 percent.
## [625]
A  subsequent study  of  the  same  clusters in  1990  found that  the
Disaffecteds had increased from 9 to 12 percent of the adult population,
while the “Moral Republicans” remained at 11 percent, thus constituting
together nearly a quarter of the adult population of the United States. The
survey also identified similar groups among Democratic voters—the “New
Dealers,” constituting 7  percent  of  the  adult  population, who  are
“supportive of many spending measures” but “intolerant on social issues
and  somewhat hawkish on  defense,” and  the  “God and  Country
Democrats,” constituting 8  percent of  the  adult population, are
“disproportionately black,” and exhibit “a strong faith in America and are
highly religious. They favor social spending and  are  moderately
intolerant.”
## [626]
The attitudes and social profile of both the Disaffecteds and the Moral
Republicans correspond to those of the post-bourgeois proletariat, but the
attachment of these groups to the Republican Party may not be permanent,
as suggested by a further indication of the persistence and development of
post-bourgeois  political consciousness, the  election of  overt  racialist
candidate David Duke  to  a  seat  in  the  Louisiana state  legislature in
February,  1989. Although Duke ran  as  a  Republican, his  former
membership in the Ku Klux Klan and the strong opposition to his candidacy
by  Ronald Reagan, George  Bush,  and  Republican National Committee
Chairman Lee Atwater effectively separated him from the party. Despite the
hostility of his own party and local and national news media and despite his
comparative lack of campaign funds, Duke narrowly defeated his opponent,
the brother of a former Democratic governor of the state, and did so without
compromising or diluting his racialist and nationalist rhetoric. Voters who

supported Duke were virtual archetypes of Warren’s MARs and the post-
bourgeois proletariat, according to a survey conducted for The New Orleans
Times-Picayune during the election.
Duke’s  constituents live  in  a  microcosm of  white, suburban America. District 81  is
characterized by middle incomes, fear of crime and a distaste for taxes. Moreover, the
voters . . . express a smoldering sense that, at worst, government confiscates the work of
its best citizens and lavishes it, to no apparent effect, on people who are ungrateful or
openly hostile.
Affirmative-action programs, minority set-asides, racial quotas and other efforts on behalf
of blacks have tilted the system against them, the voters said. When it comes to job and
educational opportunities, they feel whites increasingly are ending up on the short end of
the stick.
In Duke, voters said they saw an opportunity to fight back.
## [627]
In  October,  1990,  Duke  forced the  withdrawal of  the  Republican
candidate in a senatorial campaign and received 44 percent of the popular
vote  and  60  percent  of  the  white  vote  against Democratic incumbent
Senator J. Bennett Johnston. Nor was Duke the only politician to appeal
explicitly to racial issues. In 1990, both Republicans Jesse Helms and Pete
Wilson  used  similar appeals against affirmative action in  successful
campaigns for  the  Senate in  North Carolina and  the  governorship in
## California.
Despite the neutralization of the post-bourgeois militancy of the 1970s
under the Reagan administration and the assimilation of the New Right by
the soft managerial regime, the 1980s witnessed the efflorescence of an
organized racial  extremism that  was  a  pathological expression of  post-
bourgeois consciousness. The most notable organization of this kind was
the clandestine group known as “The Order,” which espoused a neo-Nazi
ideology and allegedly engaged in armed robberies and racially motivated
assassination prior to the apprehension or death of its members. Regardless
of its extremist tactics, however, The Order, as its manifesto of November

25, 1984, reveals, espoused a number of themes associated with the post-
bourgeois  proletariat. The  manifesto, entitled “A  Declaration of  War,”
expressed these  themes in  an  explicit racialist ideology that  combined
complaints of economic, political, and cultural dispossession by an elite in
alliance with an underclass and rejection of the cosmopolitan and hedonistic
ethic of the regime.
We have become a people dispossessed. . . . All about us the land is dying. Our cities
swarm with dusky hordes. The water is rancid and the air is rank. Our farms are being
seized by usurious leeches and our people are being forced off the land. The Capitalists
and the Communists pick gleefully at our bones while the vile hook-nosed masters of
usury orchestrate our destruction. . . . Everyday the rich tighten the chains that lay heavy
upon our people. How pitiful the white working class has become. Where is the brave
Aryan yeoman so quick to smite the tyrant’s hand?
## [628]
In a similar document, “An Open Letter to the U.S. Congress,” The
Order held the Congress and the American political elite responsible for the
dispossession of the “Aryan” race through the alliance of the elite with a
non-white underclass.
You passed the “Civil Rights” laws which gave us busing in the first place. And then you
refused repeatedly to specifically outlaw this monstrous crime against our children. It was
your scramble for Black votes and your cowardice in the face of the controlled news media
which allowed our cities to become crime-infested jungles. You set up the requirements
that employers had to meet racial quotas. And you passed the immigration laws which
started the flood of non-white immigrants into America—a flood which is now out of
control.
## [629]
Although racialism provided the  framework for  the  ideology of The
Order, other themes, not explicitly linked to race, included environmental
pollution, the decline of the farm, the economic dislocation of the farmer
and worker and their exploitation by international “capitalists,” the betrayal
of  U.S.  soldiers in Vietnam, the  erosion of  national  security,  “rampant
drugs,” and the legitimization of abortion and homosexuality.
While The Order itself was short-lived, similar groups, some with links

to The Order, also flourished in the 1980s, stimulated by the recession of
the early part of the decade and the farm crisis of the Midwest, which at
least  temporarily jeopardized the  ability of  the  soft  regime to  provide
material security for post-bourgeois forces. While the total number of such
organizations was not large (“at least 67” according to the Anti-Defamation
League of B’nai B’rith in 1987), and they were isolated from the mass
organizations of culture and communication, this movement seems to have
initiated the development of a post-bourgeois subculture that rejected the
regime and  its  manipulative rewards and  to  have  established  some
organizational and communicational structure through reliance on computer
networks, publications, and radio stations. At the end of the 1980s violent
youth  groups of  “skinheads” adopted Nazi  insignia and  ideology and
engaged in violent attacks on blacks, homosexuals, and Jews. An estimated
2,000 to 10,000 skinheads were reported to be active in 23 states, and were
recruited and organized by racialist groups.
## [630]
The growth of white racialist extremism in the 1980s represented the
continuing fragmentation and decomposition of the soft managerial regime
and  of  the  society  over  which it  held  dominance, and  it  revealed the
incapacity of the regime to integrate subordinate social forces; but it also
represented the  continuing evolution of  an  autonomous post-bourgeois
consciousness and identity, although in a pathological form. The violence
practiced by some racialist groups reflected the Class II residues of the
post-bourgeois  proletariat, as  did  the  racial solidarism, rejection of
hedonism, and acceptance of an ascetic ethic that recognized the duty of
sacrifice and postponement of gratification that racialism expressed. While
the  violence, illegality,  and  clandestinity of  the  racialist movement
presented obstacles to effective organization and alienated many potential
adherents, the nationwide expression of racialism in the 1980s confirmed

the growth of a radical post-bourgeois consciousness that identified itself in
opposition to the soft managerial elite and its regime, its cosmopolitan and
hedonistic ideology, and its manipulative and dispersive style of dominance.
A related but not necessarily racialist or pathological manifestation of post-
bourgeois  radicalization appeared in  the  formation of  vigilante, self-
defense, and  “neighborhood watch”  organizations, often  composed of
working and lower middle-class elements, to protect local communities and
neighborhoods against criminal activities. Some groups or individuals with
community support used  extralegal  force  or  the  threat  of  force  against
criminals in  their  neighborhoods—in Detroit in  November,  1987,  two
residents of a lower middle class white neighborhood burned down a house
used  by  drug  dealers  to  distribute illicit  drugs  and  were  subsequently
acquitted of  arson  charges  by  a  Detroit jury—while a  more  common
response consisted in an estimated 18,000 “crime watch” groups with 1
million members across the United States who worked within the law and
in cooperation with police to control local crime.
## [631]
The emergence of such
private or  extralegal anti-crime groups and  activities may  indicate the
beginning of a process of displacement of Class I residues in the elite, the
law  enforcement, judicial, and  penal  apparatus of  which is  unable or
unwilling to  respond to  criminal challenges with  force, by  elements
exhibiting Class II residues and the readiness to use force and assert group
solidarity that are associated with the residues of Class II.
Despite the revival of racialism and the radicalization of some post-
bourgeois elements by the threat of crime, however, the mainstream of the
post-bourgeois  proletariat remained a  principal base  for  the  Republican
Party under both Reagan and Bush, and the expression of post-bourgeois
themes by Bush in the 1988 presidential election played a significant role in
his victory. Bush’s opposition to gun control, abortion, and tax increases

and  particularly his  attacks on Michael Dukakis’s  release from  a
Massachusetts prison  of  convicted black  rapist  Willie  Horton and  his
denunciation of Dukakis’s veto of a state law requiring the recital of the
Pledge of Allegiance in Massachusetts public schools served to mobilize
Middle American support for  the  Republican candidate and  to  attract
Southern and Northern working class white Democrats. As president, Bush
also appealed to Middle American sentiments in opposing Democratic civil
rights bills in 1990 and 1991, arguing that the legislation would effectually
require employers to establish racial quotas that would jeopardize white
middle class jobs and promotions. Interviewed by The  Washington  Post
about  the  Democratic Party  and  its  bills,  one  white  Chicago  firefighter
expressed a virtually explicit post-bourgeois identity. The Democrats, in his
words, were “creating a new class of the downtrodden, and that’s us. The
guys they are stepping on are middle-class white Americans, and we are
leaving in droves to vote for the Republican party.” As Post reporters Tom
Kenworthy and Thomas B.  Edsall noted, the  controversy over  the  civil
rights bill was not a dispute between Republicans and Democrats but “about
who gets hired and who gets promoted, who gets ahead enough to send his
kids to college and who gets left behind.”
## [632]
The emergence of an explicit
post-bourgeois consciousness as a “new class of the downtrodden” suggests
that the perceived endangerment of Middle American economic security
and aspirations will instigate a social and political radicalization that may
find  the  Republican Party  an  unsatisfactory and  inadequate vehicle of
expression.
Republican attraction of  post-bourgeois  groups was  based  largely  on
symbolic and rhetorical manipulation in an effort to stabilize such groups
within the  dominant political apparatus of  the  soft  regime and  did  not
represent any substantive effort to alter the structure and functioning of the

regime. Bush’s  own  civil  rights bill  contained language virtually
indistinguishable from that of the Democrats,
## [633]
and his exploitation of
post-bourgeois forces was consistent with Republican political tactics since
Eisenhower similarly co-opted the following of Joseph McCarthy to win the
presidency in 1952. Nixon and Reagan also exploited the MAR and post-
bourgeois followings of George Wallace in 1968 and the New Right in
1980, but did so only for the purpose of winning election and with the effect
of neutralizing post-bourgeois radicalism. Despite the electoral dependence
of the Republican Party on post-bourgeois political forces, at no time has a
Republican administration seriously sought to  satisfy post-bourgeois
aspirations and interests through substantial modification of the soft regime.
“With nominees like Gov. Dukakis,” the Wall Street Journal reported in
## 1989,
the GOP’s sophisticated media regiments can be rolled out again to blast the Democrats for
their views on family values, defense, patriotism. “It is an artificial way to maintain the old
cohesion of the Republican coalition,” says Kevin Phillips, the GOP theorist. “It is totally
phony, and it may not work a second time.” But that doesn’t mean Republicans won’t try.
## [634]
Despite the entrenchment of the soft managerial elite and its regime as a
“dominant minority,” then, the post-bourgeois stratum continues to exist as
an “internal proletariat” alienated from the elite and from the organizations
and ideology by which the elite holds power, and the radicalization of at
least parts of the post-bourgeois proletariat in the 1980s suggests that the
process of “secession” from the rule of the dominant minority has begun.
The  main  lines  of  post-bourgeois  consciousness have  evolved  in  an
increasingly clear  form  since  its  first  appearance in  the  “populist”
movements of the 1930s. This consciousness regards the soft managerial
regime as a dominant and exploitative force that acquires and holds power
through an alliance with a largely non-white underclass and uses its power

for purposes contrary to the interests and values of post-bourgeois groups.
These purposes, intended to enhance and perpetuate the dominance of the
soft elite, are perceptible to the post-bourgeois mentality throughout the
operations of the fused apparatus of the managerial state, economy, and
culture. The bureaucratic elite of the managerial state challenges the social
and  moral  codes  of  the  post-bourgeois  stratum through its  manipulative
social engineering and seeks to displace post-bourgeois social institutions
through regulatory, therapeutic, rehabilitative, and educational techniques
that reflect the hedonistic and cosmopolitan formulas of the soft elite. Such
challenges are manifest in legislation and policies concerned with welfare,
health care, the family, education, and civil rights, as well as in the reliance
by  the  elite  on  rehabilitation, therapy,  and  the  minimization of  force  in
responding to  criminal violence.  In  post-bourgeois perception, the
managerial state and its functions benefit the bureaucratic elite as well as
the underclass ally of the elite, but only at the expense of the post-bourgeois
groups themselves, their interests, values, institutions, and income, which
provide the fiscal base for the structures and functions of the manipulative
state.
Similarly, the managerial corporation and its elite, fused with the state
and  wedded to  an  economy of  mass  production and  consumption,
challenges the  social  and  moral  codes  of  the  post-bourgeois  proletariat
through its  manipulation of  hedonistic and  cosmopolitan formulas and
behavior, through its “creative destruction” of social institutions and values,
and through its bureaucratization and routinization of work, leisure, and
consumption. The globalization of soft managerial capitalism through free
trade, foreign investment in the United States and the export of productive
facilities from the United States, the exchange of populations through mass
migration, and  the  internationalization of  technology threatens the

economic dispossession of the post-bourgeois proletariat, and fear of this
threat coalesces with the racial and national solidarist impulses of post-
bourgeois  groups to  enhance their  self-consciousness as  an  autonomous
social force in opposition to the soft regime.
Culturally also,  the  post-bourgeois  proletariat perceives itself  as
alienated from and threatened by the dominant cosmopolitan and hedonistic
patterns of behavior, thought, and taste that the managerial organizations of
culture and  communication disseminate. In  the  1980s, as  managerial
globalism and cultural homogenization accelerated, the cultural alienation
and  psychic secession of  the  post-bourgeois proletariat intensified,
manifested partly in enhanced racial consciousness but also in controversies
over  the  publicly financed exhibition of  artistic productions  that  were
allegedly obscene, blasphemous, or  anti-patriotic and  were  perceived as
reflecting the tastes, values, and ideology of the managerial intellectual and
verbalist elite. The financing of some of the exhibitions by the National
Endowment for  the Arts  also  pointed to  the  fusion of  the  cultural and
political elites of the soft regime as well as to the polarization of managerial
and post-bourgeois forces. Such controversies were continuations, though at
a more explicit and radical level, of similar conflicts in the 1970s over
pornography, prayer in public schools, civil rights policies, civil liberties
issues, abortion, sex education, codes of dress, speech, and comportment,
and  other  issues that  reflected the  cultural alienation of  post-bourgeois
groups from the dominant cosmopolitan and hedonistic formulas of the soft
elite.
The alienation and dispossession of the post-bourgeois proletariat by the
fused  political, economic, and  cultural apparatus of  the  soft  managerial
regime thus stimulated the emergence of post-bourgeois consciousness and

served to  radicalize its  expression in  the  late  1980s. Regardless of  the
rudimentary and often pathological state of this expression, the following
decade may witness the maturation of the post-bourgeois proletariat as an
autonomous social and political force, conscious of its own distinct identity
and of the antithesis between its interests, values, and aspirations and those
of the soft regime. This post-bourgeois maturation may precipitate a far-
reaching conflict between this  new  force  and  the  elite  of  the  regime,
resulting in the “secession” of the internal proletariat from the rule of the
dominant minority. The secession of the post-bourgeois proletariat and the
social and political conflict that would generate the secession do not point
toward the restoration of the bourgeois order or the dismantlement of the
regime and its fused political, economic, and cultural apparatus, but rather
toward the metamorphosis of the soft managerial regime into a hard regime.
It  is  this  metamorphosis, rather than  a  literal “secession,” that  would
constitute the revolution of the post-bourgeois proletariat and its emergence
as a new elite displacing the old dominant minority that “has become a
prison-house and a City of Destruction.”
The central point of conflict between the soft elite and its emerging rival
derives from the polarization of residues that the soft regime exhibits, the
radically different psychic composition of the two social forces. While the
soft elite reflects the manipulative style of dominance and the ideological
correlates associated with the Class I residues that prevail within it, the
post-bourgeois proletariat exhibits a preponderance of Class II residues and
the mental and behavioral patterns correlated with them. An emerging post-
bourgeois  consciousness would therefore reject  both  the  reliance  of  the
incumbent elite  on  manipulation and  the  hedonistic and  cosmopolitan
formulas and disciplines by which the elite seeks to preserve its dominance
through manipulation. The preponderance of Class II residues in the post-

bourgeois proletariat would generate a consciousness attracted to a coercive
rather than a manipulative behavioral pattern and style of dominance and
would formulate ascetic and solidarist ideologies in place of the hedonistic
and cosmopolitan formulas of the soft elite.
The metamorphosis of the soft regime into a hard regime would involve
a drastic displacement of the soft elite and its Class I residues by post-
bourgeois elements in which Class II residues prevail, and it would involve
also the reconstruction and re-orientation of the mass organizations of the
soft regime to reflect and conform to the interests and values of the new
post-bourgeois elite and the coercive, solidarist, and ascetic psychic and
behavioral patterns correlated with  Class  II  residues. Whether  such  a
metamorphosis will actually take place will be determined in large part by
the continued capacity of the soft regime to manipulate and assimilate post-
bourgeois  challenges, particularly through the  provision of  economic
security; but it also will be determined by the degree to which the post-
bourgeois  proletariat develops and  matures its  own  consciousness as  an
autonomous social and political force and expresses this consciousness in
the form of a hard managerial ideology that rationalizes its interests, values,
and  aspirations and  is  able  to  mobilize post-bourgeois  groups  for  the
purpose of displacing the incumbent elite and reconstructing the regime.
The  mechanisms by  which the  soft  elite  excludes, manipulates, and
neutralizes challenges from Class II elements will prevent the displacement
of the elite if the emerging post-bourgeois force does not evolve in a way
that  circumvents  these mechanisms. In  order for  post-bourgeois
consciousness to mature in ideological forms that are relatively immune to
manipulative neutralization, the post-bourgeois proletariat must free itself
of  persistent  illusions that  retard and  frustrate the  evolution of  its

autonomous consciousness and identity. Historically, post-bourgeois forces
have identified themselves and allied with bourgeois conservative forces in
the Republican Party or in transient “third party” movements and cults, but
neither the  traditional conservatism  espoused by  the  fragments of  the
bourgeois elite nor the more recent reformulations of neoconservative and
neo-entrepreneurial ideologies of managerial consolidation under Reagan
and  Bush  will  provide adequate expression for  post-bourgeois  values,
interests, and aspirations, nor will the evangelical Christianity of the New
Right or the conspiratorial demonology of the Far Right. The Republican
mobilization of post-bourgeois groups in fact represents a deformation of
post-bourgeois consciousness, and their identification with “conservatism”
of  any  kind  can  yield  only  a  pseudomorphosis of  the  post-bourgeois
proletariat that conscripts it into the service of the soft regime, prevents it
from  presenting a  radical challenge to  the  regime, and  paralyzes its
development as an autonomous and unified social and political force. Only
if post-bourgeois consciousness expresses itself in ideological vehicles that
reject both the soft managerial formulas of hedonism and cosmopolitanism
as well as the remnants of bourgeois conservatism can it avoid assimilation
by the soft regime, present an effective challenge to the incumbent elite, and
aspire to the reconstruction and metamorphosis of the regime under its own
leadership.
Although post-bourgeois consciousness conforms in some respects to
the  values espoused by  traditional  bourgeois  conservatism and  in  its
embryonic form  has  allied  with  bourgeois  conservative forces, its  full
maturation as  an  autonomous social and  political identity  would be
incompatible with both the forms and the political objectives of bourgeois
conservatism. The central ideological formula of bourgeois conservatism,
reflecting the interests and values of the compact, personally and locally

based bourgeois elite, was a version of classical liberalism that insisted on a
laissez-faire  economy,  a  decentralized, informal, localistic, and  private
social order, a constitutionalist and neutral state, and the personally owned
and operated entrepreneurial firm as an economic, social, and cultural base
of  the  elite.  The  post-bourgeois  proletariat is  a  social  formation that  is
opposed or indifferent to these bourgeois economic and political institutions
by  virtue  of  its  material interests.  Although post-bourgeois  groups are
“middle-class” in  that  their  income level  is  intermediate between the
extremes of  wealth and  poverty,  their  economic position  is  largely
dependent on  the  mass  organizations of  managerial capitalism  and  the
managerial state. They are employed as “blue collar” or semi-skilled labor
by the mass corporations, organized by the mass labor unions, and protected
by the paternalistic regulatory policies of the mass state. These policies,
including the  provision of  social  security,  unemployment compensation,
workers’ rights, job benefits, and legal protection of labor organizations, are
in contradiction to the economic and political institutions of the bourgeois
order  and  to  the  values and  ideas  of  bourgeois  conservative  ideology.
Moreover, for the most part, post-bourgeois elements do not own or operate
their own business firms and have no expectations of doing so, and those
elements that  do  are  likely  to  exhibit not  the  values and  aspirations of
economic growth and  expansion  but  rather an  ethic  of  economic
subsistence. Hence, the post-bourgeois proletariat displays little attachment
to hard property capable of generating wealth, to the entrepreneurial firm or
the market economy of entrepreneurial capitalism, or to the classical liberal
ideology that offered formulas of rationalization for these institutions of the
bourgeois order. Nor does the post-bourgeois proletariat exhibit significant
attachment to  the  “nightwatchman” or  constitutionally limited,
decentralized, neutralist, minimal state  of  the  bourgeois  order,  or  to  the

“rule of law” formulas that rationalized it. Both post-bourgeois needs for
economic security as well as post-bourgeois attraction to coercive mental
and behavioral patterns and to ideological formulas of racial, national, and
cultural solidarism point toward a political organization that is colossal,
centralized, and active in the protection and enforcement of post-bourgeois
economic interests and cultural aspirations.
While post-bourgeois  forces do  not  reject colossalism and  mass
organization in  the  state,  economy,  or  culture, they  do  reject the
manipulative techniques by which such organizations function in the soft
regime. The  ideological configurations of  the  regime  provide
rationalizations for  the  manipulative style  and  techniques by  which it
functions. Hedonism and  cosmopolitanism are  ideological formulas
peculiar to the soft regime that allow the elite to rationalize its manipulation
of social institutions and values through an economy of mass consumption
and  material gratification, a  bureaucratic state  that  undertakes social
engineering and reconstruction, and a cultural apparatus that designs and
legitimizes social  manipulation.  Scientism and  utopian or  meliorist
formulas also  are  managerial ideologies that  both  the  soft  and  hard
managerial regimes exhibit, though in different forms. The ideas that human
society can  be  significantly ameliorated or  perfected and  that  this
amelioration is  possible through the  application of  scientific managerial
skills to human beings and social institutions and processes are essential to
the  legitimization  of  mass  organizations and  the  managerial elites  that
control and  direct  them.  While in  the  soft  regime, melioristic formulas
depict amelioration in the hedonistic, eudemonian, and cosmopolitan terms
appropriate to an economy of mass consumption and “liberation” from a
“repressive” social and  historical environment to  be  manipulated and
reconstructed through managerial skills, in the hard regime amelioration is

depicted as  consisting in  the  perfection of  societal solidarity—the
exclusion, defeat, or destruction of alien or disruptive forces that threaten,
exploit, or retard the identity of the nation, race, class, or culture that is the
core of social solidarity—and in a Spartan, “Catonistic,” or primitivistic
utopia that  sacrifices immediate gratification of  the  individual  for  the
interests of the collectivity. Similarly, scientistic ideology in the soft regime
tends to emphasize the amelioration of the social and historical environment
through the  manipulative application of  scientific and  managerial skills,
while in the hard regime, scientism tends to emphasize the application of
science to  the  instruments of  coercion in  military organization and
technology and to the disciplining of the mass population and society for
war  and  conflict; amelioration  in  the  hard  regime consists in  the
invincibility that such applications are intended to yield.
Post-bourgeois  rejection of  manipulation thus  involves not  only  the
rejection of the hedonistic and cosmopolitan formulas of the soft elite but
also the reformulation of the meliorist and scientistic formulas of the soft
regime in  terms  compatible with  the  hard  regime toward which  post-
bourgeois forces point. Post-bourgeois ideology must express a solidarism
that postulates a collective identity, synthesizing the elements of class, race,
nation, and culture, as the concrete basis of loyalty and value and rejecting
the  cosmopolitanism of  the  soft  regime and  its  dispersive globalist and
egalitarian derivatives. Similarly, post-bourgeois ideology must also express
a formula and ethic of asceticism that rationalizes deferral of gratification,
acceptance of sacrifice for the solidarist identity, and rejection of hedonistic
indulgence. Post-bourgeois  ideology also  would postulate reliance on
coercion rather than manipulation as a means of responding to challenges
and resolving problems, and it would rationalize consolidation of social
solidarity rather than the acceleration and manipulation of social change. Its

emergence  as  a  new  elite  would probably be  attended by  violence and
physical conflict. The ideological affirmation of the use of coercion, group
solidarity, and the prevalence of concrete collective interests and values
over the interests and values of individuality and the abstract identities of
cosmopolitan ideology would tend  to  immunize post-bourgeois  forces
against manipulative assimilation by the soft elite and to distinguish post-
bourgeois identity as an autonomous force directed at the metamorphosis of
the soft regime rather than participation in it and absorption by it.
The maturation of post-bourgeois consciousness in ideological form will
not by itself precipitate the metamorphosis of the regime, but the continuing
decomposition of subordinate society under the soft regime, the inability of
the  regime  to  resolve this  decomposition and  unify  subordinate social
fragments except through continuous manipulation, and the accumulating
vulnerabilities of  the  regime that  derive from  its  inherent structure and
composition suggest that the soft regime itself may soon encounter crises
and challenges that will initiate its disintegration. Not only the prospect of
catastrophic economic dysfunctions that  would discredit the  hedonistic
ethic  and  economic policies of  the  regime and  detach the  allegiance of
social fragments from it, but also the escalation of internal violence on the
part of fragments in which Class II residues are predominant, are challenges
to which the soft regime would be unable to respond effectively and would
enhance the probability of a metamorphosis into a hard regime.
Given the revolution of mass and scale and the explosion of human
numbers and  social interactions  in  the  last  hundred years,  mass
organizations and the managerial elites that control and direct them appear
to be irreversible, the only available forms of social, political, and economic
organization capable of accommodating the physical and social needs of

mass populations in the modern world. In the absence of natural or human
catastrophes that would drastically reduce human numbers and impair the
transmission of scientific, technological, and managerial skills and in lieu of
technological developments that  would render mass  organizations and
managerial skills  obsolete, there  appears to  be  no  prospect for  the
elimination of mass structures and the elites that direct them and gain power
from them. But the forms of managerial society and power remain variable,
and the failure of one form to resolve the challenges it encounters may
precipitate its transformation into another form, just as the bourgeois order
metamorphosized when it failed to meet the challenges of the revolution of
mass and scale.
The bourgeois order that preceded the emergence of managerialism was
an abortive civilization, and the bourgeois elite, confined within compact
and  parochial institutions and  an  individualizing and  particularizing
ideology, was able neither to envision nor organize a collective endeavor
that  would  transcend the  boundaries of  its  own  political and  economic
structures and  worldview; and  the  bourgeoisie were  unable to  adapt  or
respond successfully to the titanic challenges that the revolution of mass
and  scale  presented. Yet  the  soft  managerial regime that  displaced the
bourgeois order in the Western world is also a failure, and the managerial
civilization that the soft regime seemed to promise has proved as abortive
as that of the bourgeois order. The soft elite of the regime is unable to
respond effectively  to  the  challenges and  vulnerabilities that  its  own
structure and composition generate or to overcome its own self-destructive
and disintegrative tendencies. “Elites,” wrote Vilfredo Pareto, “usually end
up committing suicide,”
## [635]
and Toynbee observed that civilizations more
often die by suicide than by murder. In a similar vein, Lenin observed that
no government ever “falls” unless it is first “dropped.” Should the soft

regime continue to encounter challenges to which its internal structure and
composition do not allow adequate responses and resolutions, and should
such crises occur in conjunction with the maturation of the post-bourgeois
proletariat as a self-conscious and autonomous social and political force
determined to displace the soft elite as a dominant minority, then the self-
destructive tendencies of  the  leviathan the  soft  regime has  created may
cause it, through its metamorphosis, to “drop” its own power into the hands
of the enemies it also has created. The metamorphosis of the managerial
regime may therefore represent the future of modern society and, despite
the peculiar vulnerabilities that a hard managerial regime would exhibit, it
may offer an opportunity for a more enduring and effective mobilization of
mass loyalties and energies in a new managerial civilization than has been
possible under the  liberal and  humanist formulas of  its  stillborn
predecessors.

[1] James Burnham, The Managerial Revolution, What Is Happening in the World (New York: John
Day  Company,  1941). In  an  introduction  to  a  1960  reprint of The  Managerial Revolution
(Bloomington, Ind.: University of Indiana Press, 1960), vii, Burnham wrote that if he were
writing in  that  year,  he  “would allow  for  a  greater range  of  variation within the  form  of
managerial society” and recognize the possibility of a more democratic and capitalist variety
than he had in 1941.
[2] In The Machiavellians, Defenders of Freedom (New York: John Day Company, 1943), a study of
Pareto, Mosca, Robert Michels, and Georges Sorel, Burnham reformulated the theory of the
managerial revolution in terms of the elite model that these writers had articulated. For studies of
Burnham’s  thought, see  James Diggins, Up  from  Communism, Conservative Odysseys in
American Intellectual History (New York: Harper & Row, 1975); Samuel T. Francis, Power and
History, The Political Thought of James Burnham (Lanham, Md.: University Press of America,
1984); and National Review, September 11, 1987.

The present study disagrees with Boulding’s view that “the most important forces bringing about
the rise of large-scale organizations have been in the side of ‘supply’ rather than of ‘demand,’
that is, in the skills and techniques of organization,” 17. In so far as the distinction between
“supply” (the ability to construct mass organizations) and “demand” (the needs and functions
they serve) is meaningful, it is the latter—the need to organize the new massive scale of human
numbers and their interactions—that principally caused the creation of such organizations. This
study also dissents from Sorokin’s view that “colossalism” is a symptom of decadence. On the
contrary, it is a social form or style characteristic of a potentially new civilization.

Corporate Control,  Corporate Power  (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,  1981), who
finds that managerial control of large corporations is “an established truth” (14), but argues that
even in managerially controlled corporations, “profitable growth” is “the primary objective of
the large managerial corporations today, as well as of the large firms of 50 or 75 years ago” (86)
—in other words, that there is little or no conflict of goals between managers and owners.
Nevertheless, while  “profitable growth” may  be  the  main  goal  of  the  corporation, the
perpetuation and enlargement of the corporate enterprise is a fundamental goal of its managers as
well as of those large stockholders whose personal fortunes depend on the corporation. In other
words, there is no necessary conflict between the “ownership goal” of profitability and the
“management goal” of corporate growth. While managerial theorists such as Burnham, Berle and
Means, Galbraith, Chandler, et al. may have exaggerated the extent of the conflict of interest
between stock  owners and  managers, they  accurately perceived the  managerial interest in
organizational enlargement, complexity, and functional technicality, all of which tend to enhance
the opportunities for the power and rewards of the managers. The stock owners, on the other
hand, have no interest in organizational growth except in so far as it generates profit. By analogy,
when a nation is engaged in war, the officer corps of its army has an interest in winning the war,
which it shares with the nation’s citizenry, but, apart from that goal, it also has an interest in
preserving and enlarging the army itself. The citizens of the nation, however, have no interest in
enlarging the armed forces except in so far as it serves to obtain victory, and in this respect there
is  at  least  a  potential conflict of  interest  between the  citizens (“owners”) and  officers
## (“managers”).

[91]  G.   William  Domhoff, Who  Rules America Now? A  View  for  the  ‘80s  (Englewood Cliffs,

America? (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.:    Prentice-Hall, 1967) and is the latest in a series, all of which
make essentially the same Millsian argument that American economic and political institutions
are controlled by a “power elite” led by the “social upper class” or “propertied class.” The other
principal works in the series are The Higher Circles,    The Governing Class in America (New
York:   Random House, 1970) and The Powers That Be,   Processes of Ruling-Class Domination in
America (New York:   Random House, 1978). Although Mills’s work is the locus classicus of this
view, I concentrate on Domhoff because his data are more recent than those of Mills and make
the stronger and more up-to-date argument for their position.
[92] Chandler, The Visible Hand,  584 n3 and 491.

[93] In an earlier book in his series, Domhoff does implicitly recognize the new imperatives and
interests created by  managerial capitalism.  Noting the  superficial resemblances between his
theory of  power elite  domination and  the  “ultra-conservative” theory that  “the  country is
manipulated by a small, well-knit group of internationalists who operate in terms of a shared
collectivist ideology which is contrary to everything America has stood for in the past,” Domhoff
(who is well to the left in his own political views) remarks that “we agree on who runs the
country” but that it “is not communism or liberalism or a desire for greater power but business
problems [the need for overseas markets and investments] which make the majority of the power
elite internationalists,” that the similarities between a Russian communist and David Rockefeller,
a bête  noire  of  the  ultra-conservatives, are  that  “Both  are  internationalists, both  need  large
centralized governments, both accept the idea of government welfare to the needy, and both have
a relatively scientific secular view of the world,” and that these similarities “are not a function of
ideological beliefs, but of certain necessities” that arise from the nature and interests of the
power elite. The interests that he describes are largely tantamount to those here ascribed to the
managerial elite and its dependents in the propertied elite, and they are opposed to the interests
and values of the old bourgeois elite, which are regurgitated in the ultra-conservative writings he
cites. Domhoff’s discussion of the evolution (largely in the 1930s and ‘40s) of the new interests
of the power elite makes clear their direct relationship to the dramatic expansion of the scale of
economic organization and activities in the preceding period and the need of the power elite to
fuse  the  economy and  the  state.  See  Domhoff, The  Higher  Circles,  chapter  8 passim  and
especially 282, 286, and 292 for the above quotations.
[94] There is, however, a section of the propertied elite that remains less dependent on managerial
capitalism and continues to defend bourgeois values and institutions. Through its wealth and that
of occasional eccentrics from the managerial elite, it has historically subsidized the defense of
the bourgeois order in the form of “conservatism.”

[126] As noted in chapter 1, the managerial state flourished in part because of war; only since the
1960s, with the appearance of a global technology deemed capable of transcending national and
cultural differentiations  and  thereby of  rendering war  obsolescent, has  the  managerial
intelligentsia exhibited a pacifistic orientation. Prior to that time, the intelligentsia tended to be
favorably disposed to U.S. participation in World Wars I and II and the Cold War, all of which
served managerial interests against those of the bourgeois elite. The permanence of its pacifistic

orientation should not be taken for granted, since war may in the future again prove useful to the
enhancement of managerial interests, especially if there appears an enemy that frustrates or
threatens those interests.

with  the  theory of  managerial elites  presented here,  but  his  recognition of  the  self-serving
behavior of the New Class considerably dilutes and even contradicts his claim that regardless of
its special interests, “The New Class is the most progressive force in modern society and is a
center of whatever human emancipation is possible in the foreseeable future.” (83).

and  protective of  special  interests but  regarded their  own  ideas  as  absolute exposes the
ideological nature of their thought, its real purpose in justifying a course of action as opposed to
its ostensible purpose of explaining reality. Liberal ideology in this respect shares in the idea
expressed in Marx’s eleventh thesis on Feuerbach: “The philosophers have only interpreted the
world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.” Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels,

[229] The intellectual and verbal expressions of residues were called by Pareto their “derivations”
and correspond to and reflect the behavioral characteristics of the class of residues that prevail in
a given elite.
[230] Manipulation as a mode of power may very generally be defined as the elicitation of obedience
by means of inculcating an apparently spontaneous disposition to obey, as opposed to gaining

obedience from those not so disposed through coercion or intimidation. Manipulation conforms
to the Class I (“fox”) type because it involves a re-arrangement of the subject’s disposition.
Deception usually involves manipulation in this sense, but manipulation does not always involve
deception. Manipulation would include most  forms of  persuasion (the  re-arrangement of
arguments, facts, and values), inducement by means of rewards, and negotiation (all bargaining
is a form of re-arranging), as well as the application of the skills and techniques involved in
economic distribution, the allocation of resources and the design of policy by administration, and
verbal and communicational skills (the “fast talker” is proverbially an expert in manipulation).

[235] To say that the elites of the prescriptive order exhibited the same psychological type as those of
the  hard  managerial regimes is  not  to  say  that  the  European aristocracies were  identical in
behavior and mentality with the elites of modern totalitarian states. The psychological type
would account for the basic patterns of behavior and mentality but not for variations in them that
are due to differences in specific institutions, ideologies, and the presence of other psychological
types and social forces in the elite.

[241] The  lion-fox dichotomy of  psychological  and  behavioral types  may  have  a  genetic basis.
Recent studies of the inheritability of personality traits reportedly indicate that such traits as
“traditionalism” and “authoritarianism” (which may be correlated with Class II residues) and
political opinions on issues such as the death penalty and disarmament may be significantly
derived from or related to biologically inherited characteristics. See Constance Holden, “Does

(New York:  John Day Company, 1943), 232, for his prediction of the role of Class II residues in
the managerial elite.
[253] The war against Iraq in January-February, 1991, may seem to contradict the theory that the
American managerial regime avoids war, but the Gulf war was too short and the enemy too weak
to represent a significant exception. Moreover, the war was fought on the U.S. side with an
overwhelming advantage in technological and managerial resources; this feature of the war is
thus consistent with the theory. If the Gulf War had lasted longer, U.S. casualties been larger, or
U.S. victory been delayed, it is likely the American war effort would have been less popular and
less triumphant.

is perhaps similar to the Marxian theory of “false consciousness.”

these incidents appear to have been instigated by lower-class black members of the gang rather
than by the white, middle-class New Leftists who largely originated from soft managerial social
elements.

## AFTERWORD
## By Paul Gottfried
Thinking about a man as complex, brilliant, and unfairly neglected by
intellectual dwarfs as Sam Francis is a daunting task. One place to begin is
by quoting a passage from Sam’s oeuvre that has been read by only a few
eyes, for even his email messages contained unexpected wisdom.
Increasingly, paleoconservatives approach these formulas and the structures of power they
mask and serve in much the same way that postmodernist critics approach literary texts—
as  defensive armor that  needs  to  be  deconstructed before it  can  be  penetrated  and
discarded. So far from taking Burke and Metternich as their icons, the paleoconservatives
of  the  1990’s  are  more  likely  to  adopt Antonio Gramsci as  a  more  reliable guide  to
understanding and undermining the hegemonic cant of the regime.
What  is  striking about  this  note  are  the  casual references to  Italian
Marxism,  19th-century European conservatives, and  postmodern literary
criticism,  all  within the  limits  of  two  sentences. Present is  also  some
astonishing advice coming from  a  man  of  the  Right—that American
conservatives would do  well  to  read Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937) and
other classical Marxists (and not simply for the usual reasons of “know
your enemy”). One would not likely witness such open-mindedness on the
staffs of National Review or the Wall Street Journal, although Sam stood
roughly the  same  distance further to  the  right  of  these  self-styled
“conservatives” as they stand (or imagine themselves to stand) to the right
of, say, Rachel Maddow.
These random thoughts indicate, among other things, how Sam viewed
likeminded friends in the early 1990s. At that point, Sam still felt sympathy
for the now vanishing paleoconservatives. These companions in arms had

rebelled against the neoconservatives in the name of an older American
Right, and Sam applauded and joined in their insurgency. He was especially
gratified that paleoconservatives had begun to embrace the social sciences
and sociobiology in their efforts to unmask the forces arrayed against them.
Although Sam’s hope for the “Old Right”—or new “Old Right”—would
eventually be disappointed, a self-consciously analytic approach that, in an
optimistic moment, he  ascribed to  “paleoconservatism” would remain
characteristic of his work.
In Leviathan and  Its  Enemies,  which contains his  meditations on
managerial America, one meets Sam’s mind at its most theoretical. In this
text, he is neither the eloquent populist who wowed the Right from the
1980s until  his  death  10  years  ago;  nor  the  dutiful disciple of  James
Burnham, the professor of philosophy who had pioneered studies of the
“managerial revolution”; nor in these posthumous writings is Sam a slavish
follower of Gramsci, whose work on hegemonic consciousness he studied
with almost pious reverence. In this text, Sam was still working out his own
detailed picture  of  managerial control in  relation to  a  disintegrating
“American people.” His work is an original synthesis, which sprang from a
fertile, complex mind and  which was  articulated with  particular
deliberateness.
Sam was one of the few intellectual giants of my acquaintance who
could express himself both lyrically and forcefully. But in Leviathan, his
prose lumbers along and is reminiscent of the ponderous build of the person
who put it together. It shows a style that in no way marks the explosive
polemics associated with his journalism and speeches. As is widely known,
the directness with which he engaged insensitive questions in his columns
cost  him  his  position  at  the Washington Times.  There,  he  had  risen  to

become a  nationally honored journalist, until  summarily dismissed for
mocking political correctness once too often.
## [1]
But in Leviathan, we meet a
reflective, not fiery, Sam Francis, who is all about examining his subject.
Here, as elsewhere in his scholarly writings, he pays little attention to
George H. Nash’s argument in The Conservative Intellectual Movement in
America,  namely that  postwar American conservatism was  overflowing
with  brilliant  political theorists.
## [2]
Sam  did  not  take  such  self-promotion
seriously. He was, therefore, not disappointed when postwar conservatism
was  taken  over  by  Republican operatives and  unimaginative  New York
Jewish journalists. He could not have been disillusioned because he had
never been as impressed as others by the conservative movement’s official
self-image.
Sam was not a recovering movement conservative, because he had not
succumbed to  anything from  which he  had  to  recover.  Although he
socialized with people on the authorized right, he was never integrated into
something called the “conservative movement.” And his true friends and
heroes were  never cheerleaders for  an  organization that  ultimately
disavowed him. In a recent feature essay for National Journal, John B.
Judis  acknowledges that  the  “eccentric paleoconservative Sam  Francis”
spoke profound truth about “Middle American radicalism.”
## [3]
Unlike our
cowed, neutered conservative establishment, Judis,  who  is  an  otherwise
politically correct leftist, recognizes Sam as an original, daring thinker. This
may be possible because Judis has no professional or social stake in the
movement that declared his subject to be a non-person.
Among the figures whom Sam truly esteemed in the older conservative
movement were  his  fellow-Southerners Richard Weaver,  M.E.  Bradford,
and Clyde Wilson, as well as the anarchist firebrand Murray Rothbard. But

he never admired these authors because they adhered to a “movement” that
he saw teeming with office-seekers and Washington insiders. And he was
never impressed when someone proudly identified himself as a “movement
conservative.” The analyst of managerial society whom Francis idolized,
James Burnham, had been a Marxist-Leninist, and Burnham showed ample
traces of this in the work of his that Sam admired most, The Managerial
## Revolution.
Sam regarded Burnham’s sojourn at National Review as a footnote in the
career of a great thinker. He used to revel in telling us about how Burnham
would spend the shortest possible time each week in the offices of NR,
before returning, with a sigh of relief, to his family in Kent, Connecticut.
Apparently, the quarrelsomeness of the staff upset Burnham’s exceedingly
delicate nerves. If, however, Burnham were to return from the afterlife and
visit his old offices, he would find knee-jerk harmony reigning everywhere.
Disagreements of the kind that drove Burnham away have no more chance
of erupting at the National Review’s editorial office these days than did
quarrels in the Soviet Presidium when Stalin was in charge. NR simply has
no  remaining dissident or  independent voices left  to  purge.  Sam  also
relished conversations with Rothbard, but he applauded this advocate of
minimalist government less for his devotion to liberty than for his keen eye
for power relations. Sam never swallowed the worldview of any thinker
whole, but was prepared to search through the parts of a theory for what
fitted his understanding of the present age.
The two of us were mostly in agreement in our views. But on one point,
we agreed to disagree, and fairness requires that I mention this difference.
Sam and I would argue about his skepticism concerning whether elites
accepted their  hegemonic ideas  (in  other  words, whether elites  really

believe their  own  ideology). In  his  understanding of  circulating elites,
values and ideals were mere instruments for achieving practical goals; they
advanced the interests of those seeking positions of authority. Sam would
quote with pleasure the Italian economist and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto
(1848-1923) that those involved in the power game would exploit whatever
ideas and visions were most attractive to the masses in a particular culture.
But, according to Sam, these elites would approach the myths as nothing
more than ladders for their own ascent.
Sam  may  have  espoused this  grim  view  partly  as  a  reaction to  the
conservative movement that both of us came to despise. As conservative
institutions and  publications began  lurching leftward, they  became ever
more insistent that they represented “permanent things” or “natural rights.”
What the two of us discerned in this movement claiming to represent the
Right was the cynical use of “values” language as a means of holding on to
donors and flattering Republican electorates. And even before we perceived
this, we noticed the intellectually lazy appeal to metaphysical abstractions
among those who wrapped themselves in the “conservative” mantle. Sam
may have been so turned off by these spectacles that he devised a theory of
managerial dynamics that accorded with his experience. In his theoretical
world, moral ideals are the means by which clever elites exercise power.
Sam  may  have  extrapolated from  what  he  found among American
conservative activists; our two national parties only added confirmation to
his judgment that the quest for status rules the world.
My own view, which I defended to Sam, may be summed up briefly: a
political theology of the Left permeates our social, commercial, and cultural
relations; this substitute religion is particularly prevalent among our elites,
who browbeat others into accepting their deeply held beliefs. We debated

our different positions for years, but never came to an agreement.
Needless to say, my differences with Dr. Francis were overshadowed by
our shared assumptions about the modern age. And despite our differing
opinions about the sincerity of elites who expressed beliefs that we found
patently absurd, a  larger  truth  needs  to  be  emphasized. I  was  indelibly
influenced by Sam’s views about interlocking managerial elites and by his
insistence that “disagreement” within our ruling class is more apparent than
real.  I  eventually took  over  Sam’s  phrase “artificial negativity”  in
characterizing the appearance of dissension within the political and media
elites trying to differentiate themselves from others of their class without
looking too extreme.
One thing, however, remains clear to me now as it was back then. As a
social theorist, Sam had the most probing mind of anyone linked, however
tangentially, to the American intellectual Right. His theoretical energies did
not bring him the recognition that he most certainly deserved, and this is
hardly surprising. Sam prided himself on his independent judgment. He
was, moreover, too genuinely a person of the Right to find acceptance in a
movement that he properly regarded as belonging to the historic Left. Sam
once said to me, only half- jokingly, after finishing a conversation with a
self-proclaimed Marxist in New York City that his interlocutor “is closer to
being on the right than anyone at the Heritage Foundation.” That he ceased
to count as a real person within the current American conservative context
testifies to his intelligence, integrity, and authenticity.
The American poet Louis Untermeyer wrote a biography in the 1930s
about  one  of  the  great  lyrical poets  in  the  German language,  Heinrich
Heine.  Untermeyer subtitled his  biography Poet  and  Paradox.
## [4]
As  a
college student reading this engagingly written work, I could easily figure

out why the word “poet” appeared in the subtitle. But I didn’t have the
foggiest, even after I finished his work, why Untermeyer viewed Heine as a
“paradox.” In  Sam’s  case,  I  have  no  trouble discerning what  was
paradoxical in  his  life  and  career.  It  was  this.  Perhaps never  since
Machiavelli has a thinker been so preoccupied with the intricacies of power
relations. Sam wrote incisively on this subject and held discourses on it at
the drop of a pin.
Despite his sustained focus on power, however, he was, for the most
part, a man far from power. In this destiny, he was like Machiavelli, who
after the restoration of Medici rule over Florence in 1513 lost any influence
on  the  state  and  became an  isolated, scorned great  mind.  Even  more
relevant, Sam  never  schemed to  acquire real  power,  as  opposed  to  the
opportunity to investigate his subject and present his findings to those who
were  interested in  hearing them. Although Sam  most  definitely enjoyed
addressing dense crowds, he  nonetheless seemed embarrassed by  the
adulation he received from his fans. He used to observe to me that his
listeners rarely picked up the real gist of his remarks. After a few beers
downed with his devotees, he would happily return to his books.
He also famously published an anthology of essays, Beautiful Losers, in
which he mocked “archaic conservatives” who had failed to reshape the
political conversation. Sam was upset by his subjects, but not because he
found  their  ideas  intrinsically contemptible. He  always treated  the  Old
Right  as  the  antique  manse in  which he  himself had  once  found
accommodations. But he complained that the persuasion toward which he
had once inclined had failed to impact our political culture. The Old Right
had also been conspicuously weak in holding back the interlopers from the
left, who got to reconstruct the establishment Right. Sam maintained that

those who knew better had avoided the fray—or at most registered token
opposition.
He thought the time had come to face honestly this colossal failure. I
recall sitting in the home of Pat Buchanan, who at the time was considering
a  run  for  the  presidency,  in  the  company of,  among others, the  Kirks,
Murray Rothbard, and Sam. The question came up whether this exploratory
group should identify itself as “conservative.” When Mrs. Kirk insisted that
it  should, because all  its  basic  ideas  had  flown from  her  husband’s
typewriter, Sam rose to register his dissent. He wished that any association
with a defeated and historically irrelevant movement be rejected and that
instead we march under the banner of “the Right.”
At the time, contrary to what is now widely believed, I tried to pour
water, not oil, on the fire. In retrospect, however, we should have followed
Sam’s exhortation. I’m not sure that the name-change would have yielded
any benefit, but I also couldn’t imagine what benefit there was in trying to
push  ourselves on  to  the  bus  being driven around Washington by
“Conservatism, Inc.” It sometimes pays to throw away used-up labels or at
least leave them to Charles Krauthammer, Peggy Noonan, and Rich Lowry.
But Sam had another reason for the proposed name-change. He was
convinced that the Old Right had split into two streams of thought, one of
which was  no  longer useful for  taking the  country back  from  the  Left.
Those who exalted supposed continuities, from the Hebrews and Greeks
down to AEI or from Magna Carta down to the Reagan Revolution, he
explained, were  ignoring the  extent to  which our  polity had  been
revolutionized. Sam  was  struck by  the  glaring discontinuities between
present and past more than by any supposedly unbroken tradition. Surely he
would not have been surprised that the U.S. has wandered so far to the left

since his death. He used to chafe demonstratively when a paleoconservative
elder  invoked Anglo-Irish statesman Burke in  describing the  American
regime. Sam  thought it  downright silly  to  invoke Burke’s  appeal to
unbroken, providential continuity in political traditions when talking about
contemporary America. We  were  not  England fighting the  French
Revolution, he would explain, but a politically radicalized, bureaucratized
American state. “Don’t these people know how far to the left we’ve been
pulled?” Sam would ask rhetorically.
But there was also for Sam the saving remnant of the Right that was
willing to provide analytic explanations. These figures were a mixed lot,
and  beside  the  usual  suspects, such  as  Burnham and  Rothbard, they
included Southern traditionalists, albeit not those who represented for Sam
“the mint julep variety.” If Sam held up Richard Weaver, M.E. Bradford,
and later Pat Buchanan as mentors for the young, it was not because these
authors were pro-Confederate. He praised them for their awareness of social
dynamics. Sam also believed that such authors had grasped the nature of
“conservatism,” although in his mind that particular worldview had given
place to what he called the “Right.” Among a then-younger generation on
the right, he held in high regard Peter Brimelow, Ann Coulter, and Wayne
Lutton, because they pulled no punches in publicizing the “immigration
crisis.” For Sam, the heart of this crisis was not the debate over labor costs
but the future of what had been “the historic American nation.”
By “the Right,” he understood a post-conservative movement of change
that  required mass  mobilization  and  the  timely arrival of  appropriate
leaders. The present age, Sam maintained, needed counter-revolutionaries,
who would unseat the managerial class and restore what they could of the
pre-managerial past. But even this, he thought, might not be possible any

longer, and the most that now seemed feasible would be the creation of a
less revolutionary form of managerial rule. But the main task to which Sam
devoted himself as a scholar, rather than as an activist, was understanding
the forces shaping the political present. And he took relevant ideas from
wherever he  found them, whether from  Italian Marxism,  Burnham,
Rothbard, and the Southern Agrarians or the Catholic counterrevolutionary
Thomas Molnar. All these sources, he thought, helped us understand the
society that had emerged in the latest phase of an advanced managerial
revolution. They also threw light on the reasons that his side had failed.
Needless to say, the conservative movement, or what had become of it, was,
in Sam’s view, a bleached intellectual desert, and that included the glut of
policy studies cranked out by hired scribblers to please the corporate donors
of Republican foundations.
A self-described leftist acquaintance of mine, who revels in being called
a Marxist, read a large chunk of Sam’s posthumous work on managerialism
and was not surprised when I told him that Sam had been a pariah in the
conservative movement. My acquaintance observed that since Sam in his
social analysis sounded so much like him, it was not at all astonishing that
“conservatives” rejected his work. I then went on to explain that Sam had
been booted out of “Conservatism, Inc.,” not as a Marxist, but as a “right-
wing extremist.” I confused my listener even more by asserting that even if
Sam had been a classical Marxist, which he was not, this would have placed
him somewhere to the right of our authorized conservatism on social issues.
Unlike the  neoconservatives and  at  least  some  Republican presidential
candidates, the Marxists whom I knew in my youth did not celebrate gay
marriage or  try  to  reach  out  to  feminists. They  sounded more  like  Pat
Buchanan than Bill Kristol or Megyn Kelly.

Despite his apparent scorn for “beautiful losers,” Sam never lost his
family resemblance to those on the Old Right whom he scolded for their
ineffectiveness. Since powerlessnes is, for better or worse, our shared fate,
it may be hard to single out any of us for special blame. In an article I
commissioned him to write for The World and I in 1986, Sam presents the
neoconservatives as defenders of the managerial class.

These sectarians
and careerists rose to power in large part, according to Sam, because they
were  protected by  others in  the  media establishment and  subsidized by
corporate elites. Given this admission, it may be hard to blame the Old
Right, whom the  neocons displaced  and  marginalized, for  their  lack  of
resources and power. No matter what courage and determination the Old
Right had shown, they were staggeringly outgunned in the war that had
been thrust on them. Even more telling is the fact that there was nothing
about Sam’s life that would suggest that he did better in the face of an
overpowering enemy than  those whom he  regarded as  “archaic
conservatives.”
What did distinguish him as a thinker of the Right was his methodical
analysis of those problems that any genuine Right would have to face if it
wished to regain influence. In pursuit of this task, he never dispensed what
he called “happy talk.” And he made no secret of his belief that if a change
in the power structure favoring his side was still possible, it would take
little  short  of  the Apocalypse to  allow  that  to  happen. But  despite the
possible hopelessness of  his  cause, Sam  remained preoccupied with  the
reasons for  the  success of  his  adversaries. He  went  beyond repetitious
tributes to a glorified conservative founding generation and tried to grasp
why the other side had done so well. And some on the Old Right did not
like  the  way  he  approached their  movement and  American society in
general and  declaimed against him  as  a  “positivist” or  “historicist.”

Although Sam was equally contemptuous of those who made such charges,
his  life  was  more  complex than  he  realized. Sam  never  left  archaic
conservatism completely behind in his thinking and emotions; and anyone
contemplating his career would do well to recall the words embroidered on
cloth by Mary Queen of Scots shortly before her death: “In my beginning is
my end.”

column criticizing the Souther Baptist convention, which had recently issued an apology for
slavery. Months later, he was fired after neoconservative activist Dinesh d’Souza wrote an article
in the Washington Post reporting on Francis’s speech at the American Renaissance conference.
