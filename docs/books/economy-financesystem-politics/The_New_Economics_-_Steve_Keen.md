Why this manifesto?
Even before the Covid-19 crisis began, the global economy was not in good
shape, and neither was economic theory. The biggest economic crisis since
the Great Depression began late in the first decade of the twenty-first
century. Called the ‘Global Financial Crisis’ (GFC) in most of the world,
and the ‘Great Recession’ in the United States, it saw unemployment
explode from 4.6 per cent of the US workforce in early 2007 to 10 per cent
in late 2009. The S&P500 stock market index, which had boomed from
under 800 points in 2002 to over 1,500 in mid-2007, crashed to under 750
by early 2009. Inflation of 5.6 per cent in mid-2008 turned into deflation of
2 per cent in mid-2009.
The US economy recovered very slowly, under the influence of an
unprecedented range of government interventions, from the ‘Cash for
Clunkers’ scheme that encouraged consumers to dump old cars and buy
new ones, to ‘Quantitative Easing’, where the Federal Reserve purchased a
trillion-dollars-worth of bonds from the financial sector every year, in an
attempt to stimulate the economy by making the wealthy wealthier.
The crisis, and the sluggish recovery from it, surprised both the economists
who advise governments on economic policy, and the academics who
develop the theories and write the textbooks that train new economists. Not
only had they expected a continuation of the boom conditions that had
preceded the crisis, they in fact believed that crises could not occur.
In his Presidential Address to the American Economic Association in
January 2003, Nobel Prize winner Robert Lucas declared that crises like the
Great Depression could never occur again, because ‘Macroeconomics ...
has succeeded: Its central problem of depression prevention has been
solved, for all practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many
decades’ (Lucas 2003, p. 1). Just two months before the crisis began, the
Chief Economist of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), the world’s premier economic policy body, declared
that ‘the current economic situation is in many ways better than what we
have experienced in years’, and predicted that in 2008, ‘sustained growth in

OECD economies would be underpinned by strong job creation and falling
unemployment’ (Cotis 2007, p. 7, emphasis added). In the depths of the
crisis, George W. Bush’s Chief Economic Advisor Edward Lazear argued
that, because the downturn had been so deep, the recovery would be very
strong (Lazear and Marron 2009, Chart 1-9, p. 54). He was bitterly
disappointed by the actual outcome, which was the slowest recovery from
an economic crisis since the Great Depression itself.
How could economists be so wrong about the economy?
They could be excused their failure to see the Great Recession coming if the
crisis were something like Covid-19, when a new pathogen suddenly
emerged out of China. As long ago as 1995, Laurie Garrett declared that
such a plague was inevitable (Garrett 1995). But predicting when the
pathogen would emerge, let alone what its characteristics would be, was
clearly impossible. However, the epicentre of the Great Recession was the
US financial system itself: the crisis came from inside the economy, rather
than from outside. Surely there were warning signs? As Queen Elizabeth
herself put it when she attended a briefing at the London School of
Economics in 2008, ‘If these things were so large, how come everyone
missed them?’ (Greenhill 2008).
Not all economists did: there were some who warned that a crisis was not
merely likely, but imminent. The Dutch economist Dirk Bezemer identified
a dozen, of whom I was one (Bezemer 2009a, 2009b, 2010; Keen 1995,
2007). Though these economists came from disparate backgrounds,
Bezemer noted that they had one negative characteristic in common: ‘no
one predicted the crisis on the basis of a neo-classical framework’ (Bezemer
2010, p. 678).
One would expect that the failure by economists to anticipate the biggest
economic event of the post-Second World War world would cause
economics to change dramatically. But it hasn’t. What Bezemer called
‘Neoclassical economics’ was the dominant approach to modelling the
economy before the GFC, and it has remained dominant since.
## 1
The failure of economics to reform itself after such a profound empirical
failure has led to strong criticism of economics from within – even by
economists who have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics. Robert

Solow, the 1987 recipient, told a United States Congressional Hearing into
economics in 2010 that:
We are in desperate need of jobs, and the approach to macroeconomics that
dominates the elite universities of the country and many central banks and
other influential policy circles, that approach seems to have essentially
nothing to say about the problem. (Solow 2010, p. 12)
Paul Romer, who received the Prize in 2018, argued in 2016 that economics
had such a ‘noncommittal relationship with the truth’ that it deserved the
label of ‘post-real’ (Romer 2016, p. 5).
These criticisms of Neoclassical economics by prominent Neoclassical
economists echo criticisms that economists from other schools of thought
have been making for many decades. These rival approaches to economics
are very different to the specializations that exist in sciences like physics.
Some physicists specialize in General Relativity, others in Quantum
Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics, Newtonian physics, and so on. Each of
these approaches has different perspectives on how the Universe operates,
but each works very well in its respective domain: General Relativity in the
realm of the very large (the Universe), Quantum Mechanics in the realm of
the very small (the atom), while Newton’s equations work very well in
between, and so on.
But in economics, different schools of thought have visions of how the
economy works that are fundamentally in conflict. There is no way to
partition the economy into sections where Neoclassical economics applies
and others where rival schools of thought like Post Keynesian, Austrian or
Biophysical economics apply. On the same topic – say, for example, the
role of private debt in causing financial crises – these schools of thought
will often have answers that flatly contradict Neoclassical economics, and
frequently also, each other. These non-mainstream schools of thought,
which are collectively known as ‘heterodox’ economics, are followed by a
significant minority of academic economists – as many as 10 per cent of the
discipline, going on a campaign in France in 2015 to establish a separate
classification there (Lavoie 2015b; Orléan 2015).
## 2
The economists who did warn of the Global Financial Crisis came almost
exclusively from these dissenting schools of thought.
## 3
Though they differed

from each other in significant ways, Bezemer noted that they shared ‘a
concern with financial assets as distinct from real-sector assets, with the
credit flows that finance both forms of wealth, with the debt growth
accompanying growth in financial wealth, and with the accounting relation
between the financial and real economy’ (Bezemer 2010, p. 678).
If you haven’t yet studied economics, or you’re in your early days of doing
so at school or university, I hope this gives you pause: shouldn’t
mainstream economics also concern itself with finance and debt? Surely
they are essential features of the economy? Au contraire, the mainstream
long ago convinced itself that even money doesn’t really affect the
economy, and hence monetary phenomena – including money, banks and
private debt – are omitted from Neoclassical models. One Neoclassical
economist put it this way on Twitter:
Most people who teach macro do it by leading people through simple
models without money, so they understand exchange and production and
trade, international and inter-temporal. You can even do banks without
money [yes!]. And it’s better to start there. Then later, study money as it
superimposes itself and complicates things, giving rise to inflation,
exchange rates, business cycles.
This statement was made in late 2020 – a dozen years after the failure of
Neoclassical models to anticipate the crisis.
Why didn’t mainstream economists change their beliefs about the
significance of money in economics after their failure in 2007? Here,
paradoxically, economics is little different to physics, in that significant
change in physics does not, in general, occur because adherents of an old
way of thinking are convinced to abandon it by an experiment whose results
contradict their theory. Instead, these adherents continue to cling to their
theory, despite the experimental evidence it has failed. Humans, it appears,
are more wedded to their beliefs about reality – their ‘paradigms’, to use
Thomas Kuhn’s famous phrase (Kuhn 1970) – than reality itself. Science
changed, not because these scientists changed their minds, but because they
were replaced by new scientists who accepted the new way of thinking. As
Max Planck put it:

a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and
making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die,
and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it. (Planck 1949, pp.
## 33–4)
Here, economics is different, largely because economic ‘experiments’ are
different to scientific ones, in that they are historical events, whereas
scientific experiments are deliberate attempts to confirm a theory – some of
which fail. The Michelson–Morley experiment attempted to measure the
speed of the Earth relative to ‘the aether’, the medium that scientists then
thought allowed light to travel through space. The experiment found that
there was no discernible relative motion, which implied that the aether did
not exist. This unexpected discovery led to the rejection of the aether
theory, and ultimately the adoption of the Theory of Relativity. This
experiment can be repeated at any time – and it has been repeated, with
increasingly more sophisticated methods – and the result is always the
same. There is no way of getting away from it and returning to a pre-
Relativity science, and nor is there any desire to do so by post-Relativity
physicists.
In economics, however, it is possible to get away from the failure of theory
to play out as expected in reality. An event like the GFC occurs only once in
history, and it cannot be reproduced to allow old and new theories to be
tested against it. As time goes on, the event itself fades from memory.
History can help sustain a memory, but economic history is taught at very
few universities. Economists don’t learn from history because they’re not
taught it in the first place.
The economy is also a moving target, whereas the physical world, relatively
speaking, is a stationary one. When a clash between theoretical prediction
and empirical results occurs in physics, the state of unease persists until a
theoretical resolution is found. But in economics, though a crisis like the
GFC can cause great soul searching when it occurs, the economy changes
over time, and the focus of attention shifts.
Finally, unlike physicists, economists do want to return to pre-crisis
economic theory. Events like the GFC upset the ‘totem’ that characterizes
Neoclassical economics, the ‘supply and demand’ diagram (Leijonhufvud
## 1973),
## 4
in which the intersecting lines determine both equilibrium price and

equilibrium quantity, and in which any government intervention necessarily
makes things worse, by moving the market away from this equilibrium
point. This image of a self-regulating and self-stabilizing market system is a
powerful intellectual, and even emotional, anchor for mainstream
economists.
These factors interact to make economics extremely resistant to
fundamental change. In physics, anomalies like the clash between the
results of the Michelson–Morley experiment and the predictions of pre-
Relativity physics persist until the theory changes, because the experimental
result is eternal. The anomaly doesn’t go away, but the theory that it
contradicted dies with the pre-anomaly scientists. Try as they might, they
can’t recruit adherents to the old theory amongst new students, because the
students are aware of the anomaly, and won’t accept any theory that doesn’t
resolve it.
In economics, anomalies are gradually forgotten, and new students can be
recruited to preserve and extend the old beliefs, and to paper over
anomalous phenomena. School and university economics courses become
ways of reinforcing the Neoclassical paradigm, rather than fonts from
which new theories spring in response to failures of the dominant paradigm.
In physics, intellectual crises are intense but, relatively speaking, short-
lived. The crisis persists until a new theoretical breakthrough resolves it –
regardless of whether that breakthrough persuades existing physicists
(which as a rule, it doesn’t). The ‘anomaly’, the empirical fact that
fundamentally contradicts the existing paradigm, is like the grain of sand in
an oyster that ultimately gives birth to a pearl: the irritation cannot be
avoided, so it must be dealt with (Woit 2006).
## 5
It is the issue that believers
in the existing paradigm know they cannot resolve – though it may take
time for that realization to sink in, as various extensions of the existing
paradigm are developed, each of which proves to be partially effective but
inherently flawed. It is the thing young scientists are most aware of, the
issue they want to be the one to resolve. As their lecturers who stick to the
old paradigm age, the students take in the old ideas, but they are actively
looking for where they are wrong, and how these contradictions might be
resolved.

Once a solution is found, the protestations of the necessarily older, ageing,
sometimes retired and often deceased champions of the previous paradigm
mean nothing. Ultimately, all the significant positions in a university
department are filled by scientists who are committed to the new paradigm.
Then, as the new paradigm develops, it first undergoes a period of rapid
extension, but ultimately confronts its own critical anomaly, and the science
falls into crisis once more, as philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn (Kuhn
1970) explains.
## 6
This is a punctuated path of development. It starts with the development of
an initial paradigm by a great thinker, around whom a community of
followers coalesces. They extend the core insights and thus form a new
paradigm in that science. Initially, they enjoy a glorious period of the dance
between observation and theory, where observations confirm and extend the
paradigm. But finally, some prediction the theory makes is contradicted by
observation. After a period of denial and dismay, the science settles into an
unhappy peace: the paradigm is taught, but with less enthusiasm, the
anomaly is noted, and the various within-paradigm attempts to resolve it are
discussed. Then, out of somewhere, whether from a Professor (Planck) or a
patents clerk (Einstein), a resolution comes. Rinse and repeat.
Those punctuations never occur in economics, and because the punctuations
don’t occur, neither does the kind of revolutionary change in the discipline
that Kuhn vividly describes for physics and astronomy. Economics is,
therefore, not a science. As Kuhn explains brilliantly, a real science goes
through a process of paradigm change via a shift from what he calls ‘normal
science’, to a scientific revolution triggered by a fundamental anomaly and
resolved by a new paradigm, after which normal science resumes once
more with the new paradigm. Economics has experienced many theoretical
and empirical crises since the Neoclassical school became dominant in the
1870s, but none have resulted in a revolution to a new paradigm akin to the
shift from Ptolemaic to Copernican astronomy.
An economic crisis, when it strikes, does disturb the mainstream. Their
textbook advice – if the crisis is empirical rather than theoretical – is thrown
out of the window by policymakers while the crisis lasts. Mainstream
economists react defensively – which is not significantly different from
what happens in a science. They can justify the extraordinary policy
measures undertaken by the unexpected nature of the crisis, but then treat

the contradiction the crisis poses for their theory as an aberration, which can
be handled by admitting some modifications to peripheral aspects of the
core theory. One example is the concept of ‘bounded rationality’ promoted
by Joe Stiglitz (Stiglitz 2011, 2018). This can be invoked to say that, if
everyone were strictly rational, then the problem would not have arisen, but
because of ‘bounded rationality’, the general principle didn’t apply and, in
this instance, a deviation from policies recommended by the pure
theoretical canon is warranted.
Minor modifications are made to the Neoclassical paradigm, but
fundamental aspects of it remain sacrosanct. Again, this is comparable to
the reactions to an anomaly by adherents to an existing paradigm in a
science.
Over time, the crisis passes – whether that passing was aided or hindered by
the advice of economists. A handful of economists break with the majority
because of the anomaly, which is how heterodox economists are born. But
the majority of students become as entranced as their teachers were by the
fundamentally utopian Neoclassical vision of capitalism as a system
without power, in which everyone receives their just rewards, and in which
regulation and punishment are unnecessary, because The Market does it all.
These new students replace their masters, and they continue to propagate
the Neoclassical paradigm.
This is the first hurdle at which economics fails to be a science. The process
Planck describes, of the death of adherents of the old (Neoclassical)
paradigm resulting in them being replaced by a ‘new generation’ that is
familiar with the ‘new scientific truth’, does not occur in economics.
The second hurdle is the political role of economic theory. The last genuine
scientific revolution in economics occurred in the 1870s, when the
Neoclassical took over from the Classical school of thought – the approach
developed by Adam Smith (Smith 1776), extended by David Ricardo
(Ricardo 1817) and commandeered by Marx (Marx 1867). Neoclassical
economists imagine that their theories originated with Smith (Samuelson
and Nordhaus 2010a, p. 5), but in fact Smith, Ricardo and Marx used an
‘objective’ theory of value that is completely at odds with Neoclassical
theory. Ricardo explicitly rejected the utility-oriented, scarcity-based proto-

Neoclassical economics of his contemporary Jean-Baptiste Say, declaring
emphatically that:
There are some commodities, the value of which is determined by their
scarcity alone ... These commodities, however, form a very small part of
the mass of commodities daily exchanged in the market ... says Adam
Smith, ‘... It is natural that what is usually the produce of two days’, or two
hours’ labour, should be worth double of what is usually the produce of one
day’s, or one hour’s labour.’ ...
That this is really the foundation of the exchangeable value of all things,
excepting those which cannot be increased by human industry, is a doctrine
of the utmost importance in political economy; for from no source do so
many errors, and so much difference of opinion in that science proceed, as
from the vague ideas which are attached to the word value. (Ricardo 1817,
Chapter 1, emphasis added)
The Classical school of thought had logical problems of its own (Keen
1993a, 1993b; Steedman 1977), but a key factor in its demise, and the rise
of the Neoclassical school, was that Marx turned the Classical approach
into a critique of capitalism itself (De Vroey 1975). Since then, the fact that
Neoclassical economics supports wealthy interests, via its merit-based
theory of income distribution, has played a major role in cementing the
dominant position of Neoclassical economics. Well-funded ‘thinktanks’
promote its analysis of capitalism, so that its analysis of the economy
dominates popular and political discourse on economics. This ideological
role of Neoclassical economics means that it is defended vigorously, even
when reality proves it to be wildly wrong about the nature of capitalism
itself.
These same factors isolate those economists who refuse to ignore the
empirical and theoretical failings of Neoclassical economics, and who form
rival paradigms like Post Keynesian, Marxian, Austrian and Biophysical
Economics. These academics survive as marginalized iconoclasts within the
economics departments of leading universities (like Ha Joon Chang and
Tony Lawson at Cambridge University), as leading academics in
Departments of Business or Management rather than Economics (like
Mariana Mazzucato at UCL’s Faculty of the Built Environment), or as
lecturers in Economics in low-ranked universities that prominent

Neoclassicals don’t want to work in (such as the University of Western
Sydney in Australia, and Kingston University in the UK, where I was
respectively a Professor and Head of School).
Given this dominance of the Neoclassical paradigm despite numerous
crises, both empirical and logical (Keen 2011), and the co-existence of
incompatible rival paradigms, the discipline sits in a state of perpetual,
understated and unresolved crisis. Neoclassical economics evolves over
time, in ways that its adherents believe are scientific revolutions, but it is
never replaced in the way that obsolete paradigms are replaced in science.
Rival paradigms develop as well, but never lead to the discredited
Neoclassical paradigm being displaced.
Perhaps you’re thinking ‘But what about the Keynesian Revolution?’.
Keynes certainly saw his work as constituting a clear break with the
Neoclassical orthodoxy – which he described as ‘classical economics’:
I accuse the classical economic theory of being itself one of these pretty,
polite techniques which tries to deal with the present by abstracting from
the fact that we know very little about the future. (Keynes 1937, p. 215)
However, Keynes’s revolutionary ideas were snuffed out by John Hicks, in
a paper that purported to reach a reconciliation between ‘Mr Keynes and the
Classics’ (Hicks 1937) by developing what became known as the IS-LM
model.
## 7
Hicks interpreted Keynes as not revolutionary at all, but merely
adding ‘the Economics of Depression’ to the existing Neoclassical toolkit:
With this revision, Mr. Keynes takes a big step back to Marshallian
orthodoxy, and his theory becomes hard to distinguish from the revised and
qualified Marshallian theories, which, as we have seen, are not new. Is there
really any difference between them, or is the whole thing a sham fight? Let
us have recourse to a diagram. (Hicks 1937, p. 153)
Though he presented his model as ‘a convenient synopsis of Keynesian
theory’, and it was accepted as such by the majority of economists, Hicks
later admitted that it was a Neoclassical, ‘general equilibrium’ model he had
sketched out ‘before I wrote even the first of my papers on Keynes’ (Hicks
1981, p. 140).

The gap between what this model alleged was Keynesian economics, and
the actual economics of Keynes, was enormous, as can readily be seen by
comparing Hicks’s ‘suggested interpretation’ of Keynes, and Keynes’s own
24-page summary of his economics in ‘The General Theory of
Employment’ (Keynes 1937), which was published two months before
Hicks’s paper. The key passage in Keynes’s summary of his approach –
which reflects the accusation he levelled at ‘classical economic theory’
above – is the following:
The theory can be summed up by saying that ... the level of output and
employment as a whole depends on the amount of investment ... More
comprehensively, aggregate output depends on the propensity to hoard, on
the policy of the monetary authority, on ... But of these several factors it is
those which determine the rate of investment which are most unreliable,
since it is they which are influenced by our views of the future about which
we know so little.
This that I offer is, therefore, a theory of why output and employment are so
liable to fluctuation. (Keynes 1937, p. 221, emphasis added)
Keynes’s summary of his theory asserts that the level of investment depends
primarily upon investors’ expectations of the future, which are uncertain and
‘unreliable’. Hicks completely ignored expectations – let alone uncertainty
– and instead, modelled investment as depending upon the money supply
and the rate of interest:
This brings us to what, from many points of view, is the most important
thing in Mr. Keynes’ book. It is not only possible to show that a given
supply of money determines a certain relation between Income and
interest...; it is also possible to say something about the shape of the curve.
It will probably tend to be nearly horizontal on the left, and nearly vertical
on the right ...
Therefore, ... the special form of Mr. Keynes’ theory becomes valid. A rise
in the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital only increases
employment, and does not raise the rate of interest at all. We are completely
out of touch with the classical world. (Hicks 1937, p. 154; see also Hicks
## 1935; 1981)
## 8

The schism between Hicks’s purported model of Keynes and Keynes’s own
views was so great that it gave rise to the key heterodox school of thought,
‘Post Keynesian Economics’. So ‘the Keynesian revolution’ didn’t happen,
though Post Keynesians themselves have developed approaches to
economics that are revolutionary (Eiteman 1947; Godley 1999; Goodwin
## 1967; Graziani 1989; Keen 2020b; Minsky 1977; Moore 1979; Sraffa 1926,
1960). But a revolution in mainstream economic thought, like the rejection
of Ptolemy’s earth-centric vision of the solar system and its total
replacement by Copernicus’s sun-centric vision, has not happened.
The above paints a bleak picture of the prospects of replacing Neoclassical
economics with a fundamentally different and far more realistic paradigm.
But there have been changes over time that make this more feasible now
than it was at Keynes’s time.
Foremost here is the development of the computer, and computer software
that can easily handle large-scale dynamic and even evolutionary processes
(Gooding 2014). These developments have occurred outside economics,
and especially in engineering, physics and meteorology. There are
limitations of the applicability of these techniques to economics, largely
because of the fact that economics involves human behaviour rather than
the interaction of unconscious objects, but these limitations distort reality
far less than the Neoclassical fantasy that economic processes occur in or
near equilibrium.
## 9
The development of the Post Keynesian school of thought after the Great
Depression is also crucial. There were strident critics of the Neoclassical
mainstream before the Great Depression, such as Joseph Schumpeter and
Thorstein Veblen (Schumpeter 1928; Veblen 1898, 1908, 1909), but there
was no truly revolutionary school of economic thought.
## 10
The development
of this heterodox school over the eight decades between the Great
Depression and the GFC meant that, when that crisis struck, there were
coherent explanations of it – indeed, prescient warnings of it (Godley 2001;
Godley and Izurieta 2002; Godley and Wray 2000; Keen 1995, 2006, 2007)
– that did not exist when Keynes attempted his revolution.
Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), which arose out of interactions between
the entrepreneur Warren Mosler (Mosler 1998, 2010) and a group of Post
Keynesian economists – primarily Randy Wray (Wray 1994, 1997, 1998),

Stephanie Kelton (Bell 2000, 2001), Scott Fullwiler (Fullwiler 2003, 2005)
and Bill Mitchell (Mitchell 1987, 1994; Mitchell and Mosler 2002; Mitchell
and Watts 2002) – has also done something that has not been achieved since
Keynes: it has made the public at large aware of a distinctly non-
Neoclassical approach to economics. A non-Neoclassical economics book,
Stephanie Kelton’s The Deficit Myth (Kelton 2020), has become a best-
seller, ranking in the top 300 on Amazon on its debut. MMT is challenging
the stranglehold that the Neoclassical school has on public opinion, and
their myriad protestations about MMT are a sign that they are, for once,
worried about losing their dominance.
Similarly, non-Neoclassical scholars like Mariana Mazzucato (Mazzucato
2015, 2019), Bill Janeway (Janeway 2012) and Kate Raworth (Raworth
2017) have, if not broken the hold that the Neoclassical meme of ‘supply
and demand’ has on how the public thinks about economics, at least shaken
it by showing that there are alternative, and empirically grounded, ways to
thinking about the public and private sector’s roles in innovation, and the
dependence of the economy on the environment. Statistically-oriented
researchers like Schularick, Jordà, Taylor and Bezemer are analysing issues,
such as the role of credit in macroeconomics, which are ignored by
Neoclassical econometricians (Bezemer and Grydaki 2014; Jordà et al.
2011, 2019; Schularick and Taylor 2012; Zhang and Bezemer 2014). Some
mathematicians have become aware of fundamental fallacies in economics,
such as the timeless, ‘ergodic’ foundations of Neoclassical finance theory
(Peters 2019; Peters and Gell-Mann 2016) and are actively working on
alternative approaches (Costa Lima et al. 2014; Grasselli and Costa Lima
2012; Grasselli and Nguyen-Huu 2018).
Finally, social media has allowed student movements critical of
Neoclassical economics to evolve, flourish and persist in a way that was
impossible before the Internet. I led the first ever student revolt against
Neoclassical economics, at Sydney University in 1973 (Butler et al.
## 2009).
## 11
This revolt succeeded, in that the University finally agreed to
create a Department of Political Economy to house the dissidents, but the
protest and its success were restricted to just one university in far-away
Australia. French students established the ‘Protest Against Autistic
Economics’ in 2000, which had somewhat more traction, but no changes in

economics teaching occurred: its main legacy was an online journal called
the Real World Economic Review.
The real breakthrough came with a protest by economics students at the
University of Manchester
## 12
in the UK in 2012, in response to the failure of
their teachers to take the GFC seriously in their macroeconomics courses.
As they put it, ‘The economics we were learning seemed separate from the
economic reality that the world was facing, and devoid from the crisis that
had made many of us interested in economics to begin with’. Their Post-
Crash Economics movement in turn spawned the international Rethinking
Economics campaign, which now has groups in about 100 universities
across the world (you should join one, if you’re not already a member), and
inspired the Institute for New Economic Thinking to fund the Young
## Scholars’ Initiative.
There are therefore students eager for approaches to economics that break
away from the Neoclassical mainstream, methods of analysis which can
easily supplant the dated equilibrium methods used by Neoclassical
economics, and rival schools of thought with an intellectual tradition
spanning almost a century, on which an alternative paradigm can be
constructed. What we lack is a university system in which these conditions
can foment a paradigm shift, as has occurred several times in physics in the
last one and a half centuries, but not once in economics.
Fortunately, the GFC was such an extreme shock to the policy bodies
around the world, which were and are still dominated by Neoclassical
economists, that at least some of them – such as the OECD, which
established the unit New Approaches to Economic Challenges (NAEC) in
2012 (see https://www.oecd.org/naec/) – have started to explore alternative
approaches, including the application of ideas from other disciplines
(largely physics, engineering and computer programming) to economics.
Change is more likely to come from these institutions than from within
academic economics itself, though even here, the alternative approaches
experience hostility from entrenched Neoclassical economists.
There is also one negative factor that may finally force the change needed
in economics, which is closer to the Reformation of a degenerate religion
than a standard scientific revolution (Elliott 2017). Climate change is the
dominant issue for the human species – and all other species – during the

twenty-first century, and the work that Neoclassical economists have done
on climate change is, in my considered opinion, the worst work they have
ever done (Keen 2020a). And yet Neoclassical economists gave their
highest accolade, the deceptively named ‘Sveriges Riksbank Prize in
Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel’, to the chief proponent of
this work, William Nordhaus. When reality exposes how low grade and
utterly misleading this work has been, the revulsion that policymakers and
the public will feel at how they have been deceived by economists may
finally terminate Neoclassical economics.
I don’t want you to be on the wrong side of this stage in history. If you are a
potential or current student of economics, I want to reach you before you
embark on, or get too deeply into, a university course of study that will
attempt to inculcate a near-religious belief in the Neoclassical paradigm,
and that will drive you away if you can’t accept it. I want you to arrive at
university knowing of the modern methods of analysis that are
commonplace in the sciences and engineering, but which have been
excluded from economics by the hegemony of Neoclassical economics.
Then, perhaps, there will be a chance for a real revolution in economics,
and it can become, if not a fully-fledged science, then at least more like a
science and less like a religion.
It’s not possible to state ahead of time what the entire new paradigm will be,
but the following features are fundamental. The new paradigm will:
be fundamentally monetary, in contrast to the false, moneyless barter
model that underlies Neoclassical economics;
acknowledge that the economy is a complex system, not an
equilibrium system;
be consistent with the fundamental physics known as the Laws of
## Thermodynamics;
be grounded in empirical realism, rather than the fantasy of ‘as if’
assumptions about reality; and
be based on the techniques of system dynamics and related non-
equilibrium analytic approaches.
I explore each of these theses in the following chapters. What follows is a
Manifesto, both because it is a call for change in economics every bit as

emphatic as Martin Luther’s call for the reform of the Christian religion,
and also because it states my own distinctive approach to economics.
However, this approach has been guided by the genuine giants of
economics, philosophy and mathematics who influenced me, and I hope I
do them justice in both the text and the many references on which it is
based.
Lastly, this book makes heavy use of the modelling program I have
designed, which I named Minsky in honour of the great Post Keynesian
economist Hyman Minsky. I encourage you to download Minsky yourself,
and use it to run the models in this book as you read about them here. The
Minsky program (which runs on Windows, Apple and Linux PCs), all the
models in this book, and a free manual, Modelling with Minsky, are
available at http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/.

## Notes
1  It is often also called ‘mainstream economics’. There are divisions
within Neoclassical economics, especially between self-described
‘New Classicals’ and ‘New Keynesians’. Even more confusingly,
some ‘New Keynesians’ claim that they are not ‘Neoclassical’, and
in fact use it as a term of abuse towards ‘New Classicals’.
2   The campaign was supported by 300 of the registered 1,800
academic economists in France, one-third of whom were economic
historians, while the rest were economists.
3   The one exception was Robert Shiller, recipient of the Economics
Nobel Prize in 2013. But Shiller’s prediction relied not upon a
Neoclassical economic model, but on his excellent historical and
statistical research, which diverges substantially from mainstream
Neoclassical thinking.
4  Axel Leijonhufvud’s ‘Life among the Econ’ is a brilliant satire of
the discipline of economics. If you haven’t yet read it, put this book
down now and do so. As well as giving you a good laugh, it will
prepare you for the pompous dismissal that this book will receive
from Neoclassical economists.
5   This is not to suggest that physics always achieves the resolution
implied here, nor that the process is fast or straightforward, as Peter
Woit details in his critique of string theory in the book Not Even
Wrong (Woit 2006), and on his blog.
6  I’m also partial to the arguments of Feyerabend and Lakatos on this
topic, but Kuhn’s masterful analysis of the scientific method is the
reference to read if you are interested in how science progresses.
7  IS-LM stands for ‘Investment-Savings-Liquidity-Money’.
8  Hicks abandoned his Neoclassical beliefs in later life, and explained
that his misinterpretation of Keynes arose from his Neoclassical
model (developed in Hicks 1935) having a time period of a week –

a period over which expectations could be assumed to be constant.
Keynes, however, worked in terms of years, a period over which
expectations were bound to change. This invalidated Hicks’s LM
curve, because ‘there is no sense in liquidity, unless expectations
are uncertain’ (Hicks 1981, p. 152). He also strongly rejected the
use of equilibrium modelling techniques.
9   The obsession with equilibrium as a mathematical state of the
economy has led to exalting it as desirable as well. Certainly, as I
explain in the next chapter, the financial instability of capitalism is
a serious weakness. But as Schumpeter argued almost a century ago
(Schumpeter 1928), instability is one of the strengths of industrial
capitalism, not a weakness: it leads to the innovation and change
that is the essential strength of capitalism, compared to other social
systems. The fact that the system is out of equilibrium all the time
is partly because of, and partly the motivation for, entrepreneurial
activity.
10 There were and still are Austrian and Marxist Schools of
Economics, but the former shares many of the same foundations as
Neoclassical economics – dropping primarily the emphasis upon
equilibrium – while the latter has fundamental problems of its own
that it has never properly resolved (see Keen 1993a, 1993b).
11 The other key student leaders of this revolt were Richard Fields and
Richard Osborne in 1973, and Mike Brezniak and Rod O’Donnell
in 1974–76. Only Rod and I continued on to academic careers.
12 In a curious historical parallel, the appointment of the University of
Manchester Professor of Economics Bruce Williams as Vice-
Chancellor of Sydney University in the late 1960s was pivotal to
the outbreak of the dispute at Sydney University.

Money matters
Most people who haven’t studied economics expect economists to be
experts on money. However, as noted in the previous chapter, Neoclassical
macroeconomics effectively ignores banks, and private debt, and money.
Neoclassical economists justified this omission with the assertion that banks
– and their products, debt and money – were largely irrelevant to
macroeconomics. Ex-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke put it this
way, when he dismissed Irving Fisher’s argument that the Great Depression
was caused by a process that Fisher termed ‘debt-deflation’:
Fisher envisioned a dynamic process in which falling asset and commodity
prices created pressure on nominal debtors, forcing them into distress sales
of assets, which in turn led to further price declines and financial difficulties
... Fisher’s idea was less influential in academic circles, though, because of
the counterargument that debt-deflation represented no more than a
redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors). Absent
implausibly large differences in marginal spending propensities among the
groups, it was suggested, pure redistributions should have no significant
macroeconomic effects. (Bernanke 2000, p. 24, emphasis added)
By ‘pure redistribution’, what Bernanke meant is that, in the Neoclassical
model of banking, lending and the repayment of debt transfer money from
one group to another – from saver to borrower in the case of lending, and
from borrower to saver in the case of repayment – without affecting the
aggregate amount of money in use. Therefore, unless there is a substantial
difference in the rate at which savers and borrowers spend, this model
predicts that the macroeconomic impact of a substantial fall in the level of
debt – a ‘debt-deflation’ – will be slight.
‘Nobel Prize’ recipient Paul Krugman elaborated on this argument in his
New York Times column, where he has frequently promoted the ‘Loanable
Funds’ model of banking (Krugman 2009, 2011a, 2011b, 2013, 2015a,
2015b). In this model, banks are intermediaries between ‘more patient

people’ who want a return on their savings, and ‘less patient people’ who
want to spend more than their incomes at some point in time:
Think of it this way: when debt is rising, it’s not the economy as a whole
borrowing more money. It is, rather, a case of less patient people – people
who for whatever reason want to spend sooner rather than later – borrowing
from more patient people. (Krugman 2012, p. 147)
In this model, lending simply shuffles existing money from one set of
people to another: banks take in deposits from some customers, and lend
them out as loans to other customers. There is also no relationship between
the level of private debt and the amount of money in the economy.
This description of how banks operate needs a separate explanation of how
the amount of money in the economy changes, since behaviour in this
model just changes the distribution of the existing stock of money.
In Neoclassical economics, money creation is primarily the province of the
government, via what is known as ‘Fractional Reserve Banking’, or the
‘Money Multiplier’. A bank, it is asserted, takes in deposits from savers,
and then lends out a large fraction of these deposits to borrowers. This
lending creates money in an iterative process involving several banks, not
just one in isolation. The amount created is largely determined by the
government via its central bank, and actions by banks (and the non-bank
public) can only reduce the amount of money created, not increase it.
Gregory Mankiw explains it in this way in his textbook Macroeconomics:
If the Federal Reserve adds a dollar to the economy and that dollar is held
as currency, the money supply increases by exactly one dollar. But ... if that
dollar is deposited in a bank, and banks hold only a fraction of their
deposits in reserve, the money supply increases by more than one dollar. As
a result, to understand what determines the money supply under fractional
reserve banking, we need to take account of the interactions among (1) the
Fed’s decision about how many dollars to create, (2) banks’ decisions about
whether to hold deposits as reserves or to lend them out, and (3)
households’ decisions about whether to hold their money in the form of
currency or demand deposits. (Mankiw 2016, pp. 93–4)
There are three factors that determine the money supply in this model: the
‘monetary base’, which ‘is directly controlled by the Federal Reserve’; the

fraction of any bank deposits that banks hold on to, which ‘is determined by
the business policies of banks and the laws regulating banks’, and the
amount of money the public hold in cash versus the amount they deposit in
banks.
The only point in this model at which banks have an active role is their
capacity to hold a higher fraction of deposits as reserves than they are
required to do by law, and the only impact this can have is to reduce the
amount of money created (bank customers can also reduce the amount of
money created by keeping more of their money as cash). The central bank
therefore has the dominant role in determining the money supply, according
to Neoclassical economics. For this reason, in his Essays on the Great
Depression, Bernanke blamed the calamity of the Great Depression on the
Federal Reserve itself:
our analysis provides the clearest indictment of the Federal Reserve and US
monetary policy. Between mid-1928 and the financial crises that began in
the spring of 1931, the Fed not only refused to monetize the substantial gold
inflows to the United States but actually managed to convert positive
reserve inflows into negative growth in the M1 money stock. Thus Fed
policy was actively destabilizing in the pre-1931 period ... our methods
attribute a substantial portion of the worldwide deflation prior to 1931 to
these policy decisions by the Federal Reserve. (Bernanke 2000, p. 111)
## 1
In contrast, the Post Keynesian economist Hyman Minsky followed Irving
Fisher (Fisher 1932, 1933), and blamed the Great Depression on the
disequilibrium dynamics of private debt. Minsky combined Fisher’s ideas
with Keynes’s to develop what he christened the ‘Financial Instability
Hypothesis’ (Minsky 1963, 1975, 1977, 1978). Private debt, which
Neoclassical economists ignore, was an essential component of Minsky’s
analysis of the instability of capitalism.
For rising debt to cause rising economic activity, there must be some
mechanism by which rising debt boosts aggregate demand – in contrast to
the Neoclassical argument that changes in the level of debt were ‘pure
redistributions’ with ‘no significant macroeconomic effects’ (Bernanke
2000, p. 24). If Minsky was right, then the Neoclassical models of
‘Loanable Funds’ and ‘Fractional Reserve Banking – Money Multiplier’

must therefore be wrong: bank lending must somehow create money, and
this must also increase aggregate demand.
Minsky and other Post Keynesian economists – and some policy
economists in central banks as well (Holmes 1969) – have argued for many
decades that these Neoclassical models are indeed false, and that banks
create money when they lend (Fisher 1933; Fontana and Realfonzo 2005;
## Fullwiler 2013; Graziani 1989; Hudson 2004; Keen 1995; Minsky 1963,
1990; Minsky and Vaughan 1990; Moore 1979, 1988, 1997, 2001;
Schumpeter 1934; Werner 2014a, 2014b). Their protestations were ignored
by Neoclassical economists, but in 2014, no less an institution than The
Bank of England sided with the Post Keynesians (Kumhof and Jakab 2015;
Kumhof et al. 2015; McLeay et al. 2014a, 2014b),
## 2
and stated emphatically
that the Neoclassical models of banking – ‘Loanable Funds’, ‘Fractional
Reserve Banking’ and ‘The Money Multiplier’ – were false:
The reality of how money is created today differs from the description found
in some economics textbooks:
Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then
lending them out, bank lending creates deposits.
In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in
circulation, nor is central bank money ‘multiplied up’ into more loans
and deposits. (McLeay et al. 2014a, p. 14, emphasis added)
The Bundesbank made a similar pronouncement in 2017:
It suffices to look at the creation of (book) money as a set of straightforward
accounting entries to grasp that money and credit are created as the result of
complex interactions between banks, non-banks and the central bank. And a
bank’s ability to grant loans and create money has nothing to do with
whether it already has excess reserves or deposits at its disposal. (Deutsche
Bundesbank 2017, p. 13, emphasis added)
Neoclassical economists could not completely ignore these flat-out
contradictions of their models of banking by establishment bodies like
central banks, but rather than accepting the critique and abandoning their
models, their reaction was defensive. For example, Krugman argued that
the Bank of England’s paper was nothing new – and therefore it did not

challenge the relevance of the Loanable Funds model, even though the
model itself was technically wrong:
OK, color me puzzled. I’ve seen a number of people touting this Bank of
England paper on how banks create money as offering some kind of radical
new way of looking at the economy. And it is a good piece. But it doesn’t
seem, in any important way, to be at odds with what Tobin wrote 50 years
ago ... Don’t let monetary realism slide into monetary mysticism!
(Krugman 2014, emphasis added)
Since then, Neoclassical textbooks have continued to teach the Loanable
Funds and Fractional Reserve Banking models of banking (Mankiw 2016,
pp. 71–6, 89–100),
## 3
as if there’s nothing wrong with teaching factually
incorrect models – as if the change from a model in which banks do not
create money, to one in which they do, makes no difference to
macroeconomics.
However, the fact that banks create money when they lend has an enormous
impact on macroeconomics, and models which pretend that banks don’t
create money are utterly inaccurate models of capitalism. This can easily be
illustrated using one of the new computer software tools I alluded to earlier:
the Open Source (that is, free) ‘system dynamics’ program Minsky. You can
download Minsky without charge from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/minsky/. If you want to follow the argument
in this chapter closely, I suggest you do so now – and also download the
free companion book Modelling with Minsky from

2.1 Modelling the origins of fiat money in Minsky
Minsky is named after the great Post Keynesian economist Hyman Minsky,
whom we’ll meet again in the next chapter. Minsky the software was built to
model money, which is something that, as noted above, Neoclassical
economists have steadfastly refused to do properly.
## 4
Doing so properly has,
on the other hand, been a core quest for Post Keynesian economists. A
superb piece of logic by the Post Keynesian monetary theorist Augusto
Graziani played a pivotal role in the development of Minsky, when he noted
that three characteristics distinguished a monetary economy from a ‘barter’
system of exchange:
(a) money has to be a token currency (otherwise it would give rise to barter
and not to monetary exchanges);
(b) money has to be accepted as a means of final settlement of the
transaction (otherwise it would be credit and not money);
(c) money must not grant privileges of seignorage to any agent making a
payment.
The only way to satisfy those three conditions is to have payments made by
means of promises of a third agent, the typical third agent being nowadays a
bank. (Graziani 1989, p. 3)
This meant that ‘any monetary payment must therefore be a triangular
transaction, involving at least three agents, the payer, the payee, and the
bank’ (Graziani 1989, p. 3). In place of the mythical barter-based
Neoclassical model of trade (Graeber 2011),
## 5
in which two individuals, each
with a commodity to exchange, try to work out a relative price between them
– and where money is at best a specific commodity simply used as a
convenient measuring stick, or ‘numeraire’ – this is a fundamentally
monetary vision of capitalism. There is one person selling one commodity,
another buying it with money, and the payment is effected by a transfer of a
sum from the buyer’s bank account – the bank’s ‘promise to pay’ – to the
seller’s bank account. Therefore, to understand money, you must understand
banking.

Banks themselves developed out of the double-entry bookkeeping system
designed by accountants to keep track of financial commitments (Gleeson-
White 2011; Graeber 2011). In double-entry bookkeeping, all transactions
are recorded twice, once from the source account and once in the destination
account. Accounts are also classified as assets, liabilities, or equity,
following the rule that an entity’s assets minus its liabilities equals its equity,
or net worth.
Graziani’s insight, coupled with the fundamental role of double-entry
bookkeeping in banking, led to Minsky’s unique feature: its ‘Godley Tables’.
Named in honour of the pioneer of stock-flow consistent modelling Wynne
Godley – who was also the first economist to explicitly warn that a serious
economic crisis was inevitable in the early 2000s (Godley 2001; Godley and
Izurieta 2002; Godley and Wray 2000) – Godley Tables build
macroeconomic models based on monetary transactions, using double-entry
bookkeeping.
Each column in a Godley Table represents the account of an institution or
social class in a Minsky model, where that account must be either an asset, or
a liability, or the difference between the two, the equity of that entity.
## 6
## Since
one entity’s asset is another’s liability,
## 7
each recording of an account as an
asset requires its recording as a liability in another Godley Table for that
other entity.
It’s important to remember, as you read the following figures, that the entries
are the accounting record, not the actual thing itself: for example, figure
2.1’s model of commodity money shows the record of the amount of gold
held by each of the butter, gun and coffee producers, and not the actual gold
itself. Think of the entries as records in a spreadsheet file, rather than the
things themselves, whether these be grams of gold in a vault, penny coins in
your pocket, or electronic dollars stored in a bank database.

Figure  2.1. Money enables the butter maker to buy a gun without the gun
maker having to want butter. See http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
Each row in a Godley Table has two entries recording a specific type of
transaction at the aggregate level for a macroeconomy – such as the payment
of wages, interest on existing debt or the creation of new debt. The row must
sum to zero – otherwise you have made an accounting error. Combined with
the ‘one person’s asset is another person’s liability’ rule, this means that in a
complete Minsky model, each transaction is recorded four times.
Minsky then uses Godley Tables to build an integrated, dynamic model, with
the sum of the entries in each column determining the rate of change of the
account that column represents. Since Minsky checks to ensure that each row
is correct, a model involving possibly dozens of interlocking accounts can
easily be constructed, and edited, with Minsky ensuring that the accounting –
if not the model itself – is valid.
This method of modelling money is both remarkably simple and remarkably
powerful. It can easily demonstrate the fallacies in the Neoclassical

treatment of money, and banks, as mere intermediaries that can be omitted
from macroeconomics.
An intermediary is an entity that makes a given process easier, but which
isn’t essential to the process itself. In this sense, Neoclassicals treat money
as an intermediary to barter. If a butter producer wanted a gun (to protect his
herd) while the gun producer wanted butter (to spread on his toast), and they
knew each other, then a transaction between them could happen without
money, at some agreed ratio of butter to guns. Money makes this much
easier, partly by being a measuring stick, but more importantly, by
eliminating the problem of the ‘double coincidence of wants’. This is the
dilemma that, for a direct exchange of guns for butter to occur, the producer
of guns and the producer of butter must want each other’s commodity. If the
butter producer wants a gun, but the gun producer wants coffee, then the
butter-for-guns trade is not going to occur.
In the Neoclassical story, money evolves from trade itself, when traders
agree to use a specific commodity – preferably one that doesn’t degrade,
such as silver or gold – as the money commodity. With gold as the money
commodity, the butter producer can sell her butter for gold, and use that gold
to buy a gun, after which the gun producer uses the gold to buy coffee.
Money thus allows trade to occur more easily, and expands the number of
trades over what they would be in its absence.
Figure 2.1 shows this process using Godley Tables. The butter maker sells
butter to the coffee maker for gold, and then uses this gold to buy the gun
from the gun maker, who then buys coffee.
As noted earlier, Godley Tables classify all financial accounts as either
assets, liabilities, or equity. This commodity-money world is one in which
money (gold) is an asset to its holder, but a liability to no-one. None of the
three agents shown in figure 2.1 have any liabilities, so their equity, in
money terms, is precisely equal to their holdings of gold. The double-entry
rules that apply to a monetary economy are irrelevant here.
In this world, people hold the money commodity not for its own sake, but for
use as an intermediary in trade: it is held as a means to more easily convert
commodities the buyer has and doesn’t want, into commodities she hasn’t
got and does want. The clearest statement of this was made by one of the

true precursors of Neoclassical economics – not Adam Smith, as many
Neoclassicals believe, but Jean-Baptiste Say:
Every producer asks for money in exchange for his products, only for the
purpose of employing that money again immediately in the purchase of
another product; for we do not consume money, and it is not sought after in
ordinary cases to conceal it: thus, when a producer desires to exchange his
product for money, he may be considered as already asking for the
merchandise which he proposes to buy with this money. It is thus that the
producers, though they have all of them the air of demanding money for
their goods, do in reality demand merchandise for their merchandise. (Say
1821, Chapter 18, emphasis added)
Neoclassical economists imagine that the evolution from a commodity-
money economy to a paper money economy was enabled by a benevolent
State. Gold is heavy, and difficult to assay – is it 24 carat gold, or only 18
carat, or even worse, ‘fool’s gold’ (iron sulfide)? The State first steps in to
simplify the process, by minting ‘gold coins of known purity and weight’.
Then the State acts as custodian for the public’s holdings of gold, taking in
the physical gold and issuing members of the public with certificates to
acknowledge that they, and not the State, are the ultimate owners of that
gold:
The next step is for the government to accept gold from the public in
exchange for gold certificates – pieces of paper that can be redeemed for a
certain quantity of gold. If people believe the government’s promise to
redeem the paper bills for gold, the bills are just as valuable as the gold
itself. In addition, because the bills are lighter than gold (and gold coins),
they are easier to use in transactions. Eventually, no one carries gold around
at all, and these gold-backed government bills become the monetary
standard.
Finally, the gold backing becomes irrelevant. If no one ever bothers to
redeem the bills for gold, no one cares if the option is abandoned. As long as
everyone continues to accept the paper bills in exchange, they will have
value and serve as money. Thus, the system of commodity money evolves
into a system of fiat money. (Mankiw 2016, p. 84)
One critical aspect of this assumed evolution is that, as figure 2.1 shows, the
asset the State holds that underpins the system is a commodity – gold –

while the money in circulation is a promissory note – the promise to
exchange the note for physical gold if the note holder demands it. The asset
is thus a physical thing, while the liability is a promise, recorded on a piece
of paper. This assumed situation is shown in figure 2.2. We are now in a
Neoclassical version of monetary economy, where to trade, people exchange
the State’s ‘promise to redeem the paper bills for gold’ – the State’s liability
to the public. From now on, the rule of double-entry bookkeeping, that one
entity’s asset is another’s liability, applies. In this case, the promissory notes
held by the butter, coffee and gun producers are all liabilities of the State.

With the perspective on money that its role is simply to facilitate the
exchange of commodities, it makes sense to abstract from it altogether in
economics – hence the treatment of money in Neoclassical economics as a
‘veil over barter’. Money is only introduced in mainstream economics when
explaining inflation, which is blamed on the currency issuer creating too
much money, too quickly, relative to the real rate of growth of the economy.
This was the key conclusion of one of the most influential papers in

economics, Milton Friedman’s ‘The Optimum Quantity of Money’
(Friedman 1969), in which he introduced the infamous concept of
‘helicopter money’.
Far be it from me to accuse Friedman of being glib and misleading,
## 8
but this
paper was as incomplete as it was influential. The fanciful vision of a
helicopter dispensing dollar bills was not at all integrated with the initial
section of the paper, in which there was already $1,000 of currency in
circulation. Where did this money come from? Friedman assumed that this
currency had already been issued by a fiat currency authority:
All money consists of strict fiat money, i.e., pieces of paper, each labelled
‘This is one dollar.’ (Friedman 1969, p. 3)
He provided no history of the money, though, in his telling, these notes had
existed ‘long enough for the society to have reached a state of equilibrium’
(Friedman 1969, p. 3). Why were the notes used by the community? In
keeping with Neoclassical convention, his explanation emphasized its
voluntary use by people to avoid barter’s key weakness:
Why, in this simple, hypothetical society, should people want to hold
money? The basic reason is to serve as a medium of circulation, or
temporary abode of purchasing power, in order to avoid the need for the
famous ‘double coincidence’ of barter. (Friedman 1969, p. 3)
But why were these notes used, and not any others? And why were the notes
suddenly dropped from the helicopter also trusted:
Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and
drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is, of course, hastily
collected by members of the community. (Friedman 1969, pp. 4–5)
The only way to give this fiction some real-world substance is that the
‘helicopter’ must be owned by the same authority that had previously created
the existing 1,000 $1 bills – otherwise, the notes would have been
counterfeit, and this dropping of new ‘dollar bills’ from the sky would have
been an act of forgery. Therefore, to make Friedman’s model internally
consistent, the fiat currency issuer has to be incorporated into the model. To
make the model more than just a piece of armchair theorizing, we have to
situate it in history. Here, the ‘fiat money evolved from commodity money’
story gives way to something both more realistic and more colourful.

Harvard Law Professor Christine Desan gives the example of the re-
invention of fiat currencies in England after the fifth-century exit of the
Roman Empire, which led to the collapse of commerce in this then-primitive
backwater of Europe (Desan 2015). Fiat money – in the form of coin rather
than paper – was later created by the military rulers of the many Kingdoms
of pre-medieval England. A coin, minted with the King’s likeness – Desan
singles out Offa, the eighth-century King of Mercia, as a particularly good
example – became a way of enabling commerce within the realm he
controlled (Desan 2015, pp. 42–57). What gave the coin value was not the
commodity it contained (the coin was valued at more than the value of the
silver from which it was made), but the Kingdom itself, which was carved
out by the force of the coin as much as by the force of the sword. What
enforced the use of the coin was both its creation by the Kingdom, and its
requirement that taxes had to be paid in coin – where these taxes replaced a
previous practice of forced appropriation. Desan notes that the Neoclassical
story, in which independent traders collectively agree to use a specific
commodity as money, is fanciful, because ‘it is so difficult to understand
how people who are engaged only in bipolar exchanges can create a term for
value that is shared among them all’. Instead, the historical record shows
that:
rulers chose to make the basic unit of account – the penny – out of silver.
That choice gave silver a price ... The ‘price’ of silver was tied, by
definition, to the value of the tribute or tax obligation: pennies made by the
mint were the tokens used by the king to pay for resources advanced to him.
At the time the tax was due, each penny carried value towards extinguishing
the tax obligation. (Desan 2015, p. 58)
Given the State-created money token’s use in paying taxes, ‘the tokens
invited use as a mode of payment in private deals as well’ (Desan 2015, p.
58). In the real world, therefore, money emerged as a creature of the State
(Knapp 1924), and was backed not by any commodity, but by the power and
authority of the government that issued the coins. Also, contrary to the
arguments of critics of fiat money – who rail against the fact that fiat is
backed by nothing, and claim that this undermines commerce – the creation
of fiat money dramatically expanded commerce in these post-Roman and
pre-Medieval Kingdoms.

Therefore, to make Friedman’s cash economy example passably realistic, the
minimal elements needed are the initial creation of 1,000 penny coins by the
State, the State’s spending of these coins into the economy, the use of this
currency in transactions, and finally, the taxing of individuals by the State, to
enforce the continued use of the currency.
Creation of coins requires a Mint, which is owned by the government –
which, in this historical hypothetical, is King Offa. The King authorizes the
minting of coins by the Mint on behalf of his Treasury. This ushers in a
totally different kind of money than the Neoclassical fantasy, as illustrated in
figure 2.2, of a fiat currency as the State’s liability, backed by a physical
commodity as the State’s asset. Instead, in this real-world historical example,
the asset and the liability were the same thing, and owned by the same entity:
one-penny coins, minted by one wing of government – the Mint – on behalf
of another wing – the Treasury.
When these coins are recorded in the Godley Tables in figure 2.3, they
appear as an asset of the Mint (the leftmost column in the first table), and a
liability of the Treasury (the middle column in the second table). The
minting process thus creates an asset of 1,000 pennies for the Mint, and a
liability of 1,000 pennies for the Treasury. The two cancel out at the
aggregate level of the government – since the Mint and the Treasury are both
owned by the King. If the coins are immediately issued to the Treasury by
the Mint, then the equity of both the Mint and the Treasury remain at zero
throughout as the 1,000 coins are minted (this process is explained in detail
in the free companion book Modelling with Minsky). Only as the coins are
spent by the Treasury is money created in the Kingdom itself, and as they are
spent by the Treasury, it goes into negative equity with respect to the Mint,
as its holdings of coins are less than its ‘debt’ in coins.

Figure 2.3. Modelling the initiation of a monetary economy in Minsky. See
http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
This enables the government to create money ‘out of nothing’ – in the sense
that no commodity is needed to back the coins. However, they are backed by
the formidable power of the State that created them. Money does not outlive
the State itself, but it prevails as long as the State that issued it.
Figure 2.3 shows the money-making process in sequential order (though the
processes occur contemporaneously, and are modelled as such in Minsky):
The Mint creates the coins;

The Mint gives the coins to the Treasury;
The Treasury spends the coins to procure goods from lords and
peasants, where the purchase replaced the pre-monetary practice of
compulsory acquisition at the point of a sword;
The coins are then used by lords to pay peasants to produce output,
which is sold to both lords and peasants, and the government; and
Finally, coins are taxed from the lords and peasants by the Treasury.
As in history, so in this model: once the coins are in the hands of the public,
they can be used for inter-personal trade: the quite literal making of money
by the State, as Desan put it, enabled the market to flourish. Figure 2.4
shows a simulation of this model (which is explained in detail in the free
online companion book Modelling in Minsky).

Figure  2.4. Growth of coins and the economy from an initial minting of
1,000 coins. See http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
Two essential aspects of this primordial fiat money creation process are
firstly, that coins must be spent into the economy before they can be taxed
back to the Treasury, and secondly, that this process requires the State to go
into negative equity, while the private sector achieves precisely the same
magnitude of positive equity. These aspects of this model are both consistent
with what is called ‘Modern Monetary Theory’ today (Mosler 2010). Known
by its initials MMT, it also asserts that today, government spending precedes

taxation, and that what we call government debt is in fact the mirror image
of the money created by the State.
The first point should be obvious in this model: spending by the Treasury is
necessary before it can tax, because without the spending, there would be no
coins in the economy, and therefore no monetary income to tax. As
Stephanie Kelton asserts in The Deficit Myth (Kelton 2020), the government
spends first, and taxes later. This remains contentious in political discourse
today, because we are so far removed from the initial act of money creation
by the State. But when one goes back to that point in time, as Desan does in
Making Money (Desan 2015) and we have done here in this Minsky model,
the point is obvious: the first act of taxation has to occur after the first act of
spending, because before the State spends, there is no money in circulation
to be taxed.
The second point is more challenging to grasp, but is also consistent with
MMT’s assertion that government debt today is the mirror image of the fiat
money that accumulated government spending in excess of taxation has
created. In this Minsky model, the negative equity of the State is in fact
identical to the amount of money created by the State (see figure 2.4).
In this model, the account Coins
## Mint
is simultaneously the record of an asset
of the Mint, and a liability of the Treasury. After the Mint has given the coins
to the Treasury, and before the Treasury spends, the Treasury’s liabilities (the
coins given to it by the Mint, Coins
## Mint
) equal its assets (the coins in its
possession, Coins
## Treasury
), so that its equity is zero. As the Treasury spends,
the amount it ‘owes’ the Mint in coins remains constant, but the number of
coins in its possession falls as they are distributed to lords and peasants. The
decline in the Treasury’s equity precisely equals the rise in the equity of the
lords and peasants, since each penny spent by the Treasury ends up either in
the lords’ possession or the peasants’. The Treasury’s ‘debt’ to the Mint, in
other words, is precisely equal to the amount of money in the economy. The
Treasury going into debt to the Mint is one side of the process that creates
money: the other is spending by the Treasury to buy (rather than appropriate)
goods and services from the lords and peasants.
This leads to a rather remarkable inference: if Friedman had modelled his
hypothetical monetary economy properly rather than glibly, he, and not
Warren Mosler, would have invented Modern Monetary Theory. Instead,

Friedman invented ‘Monetarism’ – the argument that ‘inflation is always and
everywhere a monetary phenomenon’, and that therefore ‘There is one and
only one cure for inflation: to reduce the rate of monetary growth’ (Friedman
1983, pp. 46, 50).
There are superficial similarities between Monetarism and Modern Monetary
Theory, in that both attribute money creation to government action, and both
assert that a government which pushes economic activity too high by
creating too much money will cause inflation. However, behind these points
of agreement lie utterly different visions of how the government creates
money, and how its behaviour interfaces with the private sector. To evaluate
these opposing views, we have to consider the modern system of fiat money.

2.2 Modelling modern fiat money in Minsky
Neoclassical textbooks assert that the government borrows from the public in
order to finance its activities, that government activity ‘crowds out’ private,
and that government debt burdens future generations:
When a government spends more than it collects in taxes, it has a budget
deficit, which it finances by borrowing from the private sector or from foreign
governments. The accumulation of past borrowing is the government debt.
(Mankiw 2016, p. 555, emphasis added)
government borrowing reduces national saving and crowds out capital
accumulation ... Many economists have criticized this increase in government
debt as imposing an unjustifiable burden on future generations. (Mankiw
2016, pp. 556–7)
In the modern world, most money is in the form of bank deposits rather than
coins or notes, and therefore money is primarily in the form of deposits in
private banks. For simplicity, I leave cash out of the models in this section.
Bank deposits are liabilities of the private banking sector, rather than
liabilities of the modern equivalent of Offa’s Mint, the central bank. The
government’s interface with the private sector is therefore not direct, as in the
model of Offa’s coin-issuing Mint, but indirect, via private bank reserves,
which are an asset of the private banks and a liability of the central bank.
Figure 2.5 shows the basic monetary operations of today’s fiat-money system.
The core operations are all visible in the first Godley Table, for the private
banks:

Figure  2.5. The fundamental monetary operations of the government. See
http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
Government spending on the public (either via purchases of goods or
direct income support);
Taxing the public;
Selling bonds to the financial sector to cover the gap between spending
and taxation;
Treasury paying interest on those bonds;
The central bank buying some of those bonds off financial entities in
‘open market operations’;
Banks selling Treasury Bonds to the non-bank private sector; and
Treasury paying interest on those bonds to the public.

Several facts about government financing can be deduced from figure 2.5 that
are the opposite of conventional beliefs – conventional beliefs which originate
with Neoclassical economists, and are promulgated in their textbooks, such as
Mankiw’s Macroeconomics (Mankiw 2016), as cited earlier.
Firstly, Neoclassicals allege that the government must borrow from the public
to finance any excess of government spending over taxation. Figure 2.5 shows
that this belief is the exact opposite of the truth. When government spending
exceeds taxation (when Spend is greater than Tax in figure 2.5) then the
amount of money in the private sector increases by the same amount:
government spending increases the Deposits of the non-bank, non-
government sector of the economy. This means that the banking sector’s
liabilities to the non-bank private sector rise, and this is matched by an
identical increase in the banking sector’s assets of Reserves. Since both the
assets and the liabilities of the banking sector have risen, and money is the
sum of the liabilities of the banking sector,
## 9
then the deficit has created money
(Kelton 2020).
## 10
The government doesn’t need to borrow what it has already
created.
What about the sale of Treasury Bonds to the banking sector? Isn’t that
borrowing? Technically yes, because Treasury Bonds are a debt of the
government to the holder of those bonds. But where does the banking sector
get the funds it uses to buy these bonds? The real-world process is more
complicated,
## 11
but fundamentally, as well as creating additional money (when
Spend is greater than Tax in figure 2.5) the deficit creates an identical amount
of reserves: they are the additional asset that matches the additional liabilities
that net government spending on the public creates for the banking sector.
Reserves are an asset that normally earns no interest. So, when the
government then offers to sell Treasury Bonds equal to the size of the deficit,
it is presenting the banking sector with an offer to convert non-income-
earning reserves into income-earning Treasury Bonds. This is one reason why
every sale of US Treasury Bonds has been not merely successful, but
oversubscribed: an auction of Treasury Bonds is an offer to convert a non-
income-earning gift (the additional reserves created by the deficit) into an
income-earning one (Treasury Bonds). Of course, the banking sector takes
advantage of that offer.
What would happen if the Treasury didn’t sell the bonds – so that all the
bond-related flows in figure 2.5 would not exist? Money creation would still

occur, because, in that case, the only entries in the liabilities side of the
banking sector’s accounts would be Spend minus Tax: the deficit itself creates
money, regardless of whether or not bonds are sold to cover the deficit. The
consequences of not selling bonds therefore lies elsewhere in the financial
system.
Without the bond sales, the only guaranteed flows into and out of the
Treasury’s account at the central bank are Tax minus Spend – the same terms
as for the creation of money, but with the opposite sign – see the third Godley
Table in figure 2.5. Therefore, the impact of the government not selling bonds
equal to the deficit each year would be that, with sustained deficits over time,
the Treasury’s deposit account at the central bank would go negative – it
would turn into an overdraft account.
For a private entity, an overdraft at a private bank means a much higher
interest rate than on a standard loan on the negative balance in its deposit
account, limits on how high the overdraft can be, other possibly punitive
measures, and the prospect, if the overdraft gets too large, of bankruptcy. But
for the Treasury, there are no such consequences, since the Treasury is the
effective owner of the central bank. In some countries, the Treasury doesn’t
have to pay interest on Treasury Bonds owned by the central bank; in others,
it is required by law to pay interest to the central bank on any loans, including
overdrafts. But in all countries, the profits of the central bank are remitted to
the Treasury – so in effect the Treasury pays zero interest on its ‘debt’ to the
central bank. There are effectively no consequences for the Treasury from
having an overdraft at the central bank.
All bond sales do is enable the Treasury to avoid an overdraft, by keeping its
central bank account positive (or at least non-negative). Most governments
have passed laws requiring their Treasury to not be in overdraft to their central
bank – though these laws were waived by some countries during the Covid-19
crisis. New laws, based on a realistic appreciation of the role of government
money creation in a well-functioning economy, could enable the Treasury to
always run an overdraft – or let it run up a debt to the central bank – obviating
the need to sell bonds at all.
What about the interest on Treasury Bonds? That can be paid by the Treasury
borrowing from the central bank, and thus adding to a loan on which it
effectively pays zero interest – see the final line on the second and third

Godley Tables in figure 2.5. This is the government being in debt to itself, and
only for the interest it pays on the bonds it has sold.
The central bank also does not ‘monetize’ the government deficit when it buys
Treasury Bonds off the banking sector. This common expression
## 12
is simply
wrong, because the deficit is already ‘monetized’, since the deficit itself
creates money when it increases the liabilities of the banking sector (Deposits)
and the assets (Reserves). Central bank purchases of Treasury Bonds from the
banking sector undo the effect of the Treasury selling those bonds to the
banking sector in the first place: they replace income-earning assets in the
banking sector’s portfolio (Treasury Bonds) with non-income-earning ones
(reserves). The banks wouldn’t do the trade if they didn’t make a trading
profit (which is not included in the simple model in figure 2.5), but the end
result is they end up with a lower income stream, since they no longer get the
interest the Treasury pays on those bonds.
The only aspect of bond sales that affects the money supply is the sales of
bonds by the banks to the non-bank private sector (shown as the second last
row of the final Godley Table in figure 2.5), and this destroys money, rather
than either creating it, or providing money to the government for it to spend.
When banks sell Treasury Bonds to non-banks, the deposits of the non-banks
fall, as do the bank’s own assets of bonds. This destroys money: the public is
exchanging instantly accessible money for slightly less liquid interest-earning
bonds. Rather than such sales being a source of revenue for the government,
they are a source of trading profits for the banks,
## 13
and a way to reduce the
spending power of the public.
Where does the public get the money to buy these bonds? As with the funds
banks use to buy bonds on the asset side of their ledger, the funds the public
use are created by the deficit itself. So bond sales by private banks to the
public reduce the amount of money created by the deficit, and if banks sold
100 per cent of the bonds that way, the deficit would not create money – but
the public would have financial assets (the bonds) equivalent to the deficit.
This realistic perspective on government spending upends the conventional
wisdom of Neoclassical economics. The government does not ‘borrow from
the private sector’ when it runs a deficit. Instead, a deficit creates ‘debt-free’
money for the private sector. The deficit increases private savings, rather than
reducing them, as Mankiw alleges. By providing an alternative ‘debt-free’
source of new money, government deficits thus make borrowing from private

banks by households and firms less appealing – an issue we’ll consider later
in this chapter. Deficits also provide the private banks with a guaranteed
source of income in the form of interest on government bonds. This could
make them less likely to want to sell speculative financial assets to the non-
bank private sector, and more likely to finance productive investment instead
(one lives in hope).
Therefore, far from government deficits ‘burdening future generations’, they
enrich current generations monetarily.
## 14
Any impact on future generations
depends on the economic and political consequences of the spending which
generates the deficit, and they can be substantially beneficial to the private
sector, rather than deleterious. Consider, for example, the enormous deficits of
up to 25 per cent of GDP, and the resulting trebling of government debt (from
38 per cent to 118 per cent of GDP) caused by government spending during
the Second World War (see figure 2.6). Without that deficit – which, as we
have seen above, was funded by fiat money creation, not by borrowing from
the public or the banks – and corresponding ones for its allies (the UK’s
deficit hit 44 per cent of GDP in 1941), the Axis powers could well have won
the war.

Figure 2.6. US government debt and deficits over the past 120 years
Deficits of that scale rapidly increased the government debt to GDP ratio, to
118 per cent of GDP – the highest in America’s history before Covid-19.
According to Mankiw and almost all Neoclassical economists, this should
have placed an enormous burden on the ‘future generation’ that followed the
wartime one. So how did this unfortunate cohort fare?
I speak, of course, of the Baby Boomers. Born between 1946 and 1964, as
children, they were probably the most privileged and spoilt generation in
human history. Far from suffering pain as their parents paid back the
enormous government debts accumulated during the Second World War, their
time in the nurseries of school and university coincided with the ‘Golden Age
of Capitalism’ (Marglin and Schor 1992) between 1950 and 1973, when their
parents experienced high growth, low unemployment, low inflation, and – in
an apparent paradox – a falling government debt-to-GDP ratio, while the
budget was normally in deficit (see table 2.1). If that’s being burdened, then
please, bring it on.

The Baby Boomers’ woes only began after 1973, when inflation and
unemployment both rose at much the same time (see figure 2.7). Normally,
when inflation rose, unemployment fell, which appeared to vindicate the
‘inflation–unemployment trade-off’ interpretation of the ‘Phillips curve’, the
statistical relationship between inflation and unemployment (in Britain
between 1861 and 1957) that had been identified by the New Zealand
economist Bill Phillips (Phillips 1958).
## 15

Figure 2.7. US unemployment and inflation 1960–1990
When inflation rose from 2.7 per cent in mid-1972 to a post-war high of 12.4
per cent in 1975, unemployment also fell for a while – from 6 per cent at the
end of 1971 to 4.6 per cent in October 1973. But unemployment then also
began to rise – from 4.6 per cent in October 1973 to a post-war peak of 9 per
cent in mid-1975 – at the same time as inflation was rising. ‘Stagflation’ was
born, and Milton Friedman seized the day to move from the periphery of
mainstream economics to the centre. This period marked the end of the post-
war dominance of economic policy by a consensus that government policy
should attempt to keep unemployment low. From then on, the emphasis was
on achieving low inflation, and letting the market take care of the level of
unemployment.
For a while too, government policy was explicitly Monetarist. In October
1979, following Friedman’s dictum that ‘Inflation is caused by one thing only
– a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output’ (Friedman

1983, p. 47), and ‘The key proposition in monetarism is that the monetary
authorities – in the United States, the Federal Reserve System – can control
the nominal amount of money expressed in dollars but cannot control the real
quantity of money’ (Friedman 1983, p. 45), the Federal Reserve under Volcker
formally adopted the practice of trying to control the rate of growth of the
money supply, rather than controlling the short-term rate of interest.
It was an unhappy experience for all involved, from the Baby Boomers to
Milton Friedman himself. Interest rates skyrocketed, with the Federal Reserve
rate reaching a peak of over 19 per cent in 1981. Inflation did fall, from a peak
of 14¾ per cent in mid-1980, just after the Fed adopted Monetarism, to 2.5
per cent in mid-1983, but this occurred in the context of a classic deep
recession, with unemployment rising from 6 per cent when the Monetarist
experiment began, to a post-war peak of 10.8 per cent in 1983.
Milton Friedman was also unhappy, because the money supply was never
stabilized as he believed it could and should be: ‘monetary growth instead of
being steady was highly erratic, indeed far more erratic than it had been
earlier’. He blamed this on the Fed not trying hard enough: ‘monetarism again
has not worked because it has not been carried out’ (Friedman 1983, p. 54).
The Fed abandoned monetary targeting in mid-1982, and Friedman predicted
dire monetary consequences as a result:
The quantity of money rose at a rate of close to 15 percent from the middle of
1982 to the first quarter of 1983. This raises the distinct possibility that
inflation will resume in 1984 or 1985. (Friedman 1983, p. 55)
In fact, nothing of the sort occurred. There was a brief blip in inflation from
2.5 per cent in mid-1983 to 4.8 per cent in mid-1984, but this was in the
context of a classic ‘Phillips curve’ recovery from the Volcker recession; then
from mid-1984 till 1987, both unemployment and inflation fell, with the latter
reaching a nadir of 1.1 per cent in 1987. Friedman’s prediction was
spectacularly wrong.
## 16
This is not surprising, because so too was his analysis. Key aspects of his
argument were consistent with the Neoclassical canon that the money supply
was under the control of the Federal Reserve, and that what private banks
were doing could be ignored, because they were merely intermediating
between savers and borrowers. However, Post Keynesian economists (Moore
1979), some Federal Reserve officials (Holmes 1969), giants of non-
mainstream economics (Fisher 1932; Schumpeter 1934), and even some pre-

war Neoclassical economists (Pigou 1927), understood that bank lending
creates money, and the repayment of bank debt destroys it. This factor, which
Friedman and other Neoclassical economists before and since have ignored,
was the main cause of the volatility of the money supply that Friedman
blamed on the relatively hapless Federal Reserve. As figure 2.8 illustrates, the
ups and downs of credit – the annual change in private debt – had and have far
more influence on the level of economic activity than the machinations of the
## Federal Reserve.

2.3 The logic of credit’s role in aggregate demand
One of the guiding principles of macroeconomics is that one person’s expenditure is another
person’s income. Thus, if you spend $250 a year at your local pizza shop, the sum of your
expenditure on pizza (−$250 from your bank account) and the pizza shop’s income from you
(+$250 into the pizza shop’s bank account) is zero. This is because what is an expenditure to
you (buying the pizza) is an income to the recipient (selling the pizza). Expenditure and
income are two perspectives on precisely the same transaction.
The same principle applies at the macroeconomic level: expenditure IS income. We can use
this macroeconomic principle to prove that credit – the change in private debt – adds to both
income and expenditure, in a world in which bank lending creates money. This is in contrast to
the Neoclassical presumption that, to quote Bernanke, bank loans are ‘pure redistributions
[that] should have no significant macroeconomic effects’ (Bernanke 2000, p. 24). This
presumption is true only in a world where banks don’t create money, which is the world of
Neoclassical textbooks – not the real world.
The proof uses a table that I have christened a Moore Table, in honour of the Post Keynesian
economist Basil Moore, who pioneered the argument that bank lending creates money (Moore
1979). A Moore Table divides the economy into sectors, and shows expenditure by each sector
on every other sector, and the income that results from that expenditure. Each row shows both
spending by a given sector – say, Households – and the sectors that receive that expenditure –
say, Services and Manufacturing. Expenditure is shown as a negative for the spending sector
(since it is a flow of money out of the sector), and a positive for the sectors on which it is spent
(since it is a flow of money into the sector). Therefore, each row necessarily sums to zero.
Table 2.2 shows the simplest situation, for a world in which borrowing and lending don’t
occur. Let’s say that Households spend $50 billion a year on Services, and $50 billion a year on
Manufacturing; Services spends $30 billion a year on Households and $90 billion on
Manufacturing; and Manufacturing spends $70 billion a year on Households and $60 billion on
Services. Notice that each row sums to zero, that each column can differ from zero, and that
the whole table sums to zero.

Expenditure cells highlighted in bold distinguish spending classified as expenditure from
spending classified as income.
We can now classify parts of the table as aggregate expenditure and aggregate income.
## 17
## The
negative entries, on the diagonal of the table, are expenditure by each sector, and the negative
of this sum is aggregate expenditure. The off-diagonal elements are income received by one

sector from another, and the sum of these off-diagonal elements is aggregate income. They are
necessarily identical.
The next two tables use symbols rather than numbers, so that $A per year replaces the $50
billion per year spent by Households on Services, $C per year replaces the $30 billion per year
spent by Services on Households, and so on.
Table 2.3 covers the model of Loanable Funds, in that Services includes a ‘bank’ that lends, but
does not create money: it takes in new deposits (from other components of the Services sector)
and lends them out, as in Neoclassical economic textbooks. The firms whose new savings (also
measured in dollars per year) have been lent by the ‘Loanable Funds’ banks to the other sectors
obviously can’t spend those savings, so whatever is lent by the Services sector comes at the
expense of the Services sector’s spending on Households or Manufacturing.
## 18
For simplicity,
let’s assume that the reduction in Services’ spending is split equally between Households and
## Manufacturing.

Lending is neither expenditure nor income, so it can’t be shown horizontally: instead, it is
shown as a transfer across the diagonal, reducing the expenditure of the lender (Services) and
increasing the spending of the borrower (Households). Households pays Interest dollars per
year on its outstanding debt to Services, and since this is both an expenditure and an income, it
is shown horizontally.
If you now add up the off-diagonal elements in this table to calculate aggregate income, you
will see that Credit cancels out: the positive entry for Credit as expenditure by Households on
Manufacturing is matched by two negative entries of Credit/2 for Services’ spending on
Households and Manufacturing respectively:
The only effect of lending on this Loanable Funds model of a monetary economy is that
interest payments turn up as part of both expenditure and income. Therefore, if the model of
Loanable Funds were an accurate description of what banks do, it would be sensible to omit

them from macroeconomics as Neoclassical economists do, since, as Bernanke put it, lending
and repayment would be ‘pure redistributions [which] should have no significant
macroeconomic effects’ (Bernanke 2000, p. 24).
However, we know that Loanable Funds is not the real world. On this point, I will be forever
grateful to The Bank of England (McLeay et al. 2014a), and the Bundesbank (Deutsche
Bundesbank 2017) for enabling me to cite their authority on this matter, rather than having to
rely upon the same correct assertions by Post Keynesian economists (Moore 1979; Werner
2014a, 2014b), whom Neoclassical economists have ignored for decades. So, rather than
lending being a ‘pure redistribution’ of existing money, it is a simultaneous creation of new
debt and new money. ‘Whenever a bank makes a loan, it simultaneously creates a
matching deposit in the borrower’s bank account, thereby creating new money’, to quote
The Bank of England (McLeay et al. 2014a, p. 14) – including its emphasis. This has been
called ‘endogenous money’ in the Post Keynesian literature to date, but to make it more
intelligible to the public, I prefer to call this accurate, real-world description of what banks
actually do ‘bank-originated money and debt’ (with the acronym of BOMD).
It’s more complicated to show this than the other tables, since we have to add the banking
sector to the table, and we have to include the banking sector’s assets – where Credit appears
as an increase in the banking sector’s loans to the Household sector – as well as its liabilities
and its equity. Table 2.4 also explicitly shows all spending as passing through the liabilities
(deposit accounts) and equity sides of the banking sector’s accounts. The Household sector’s
expenditure on Manufacturing includes Credit, as in Loanable Funds, but this credit-financed
spending does not come at the expense of any other sector’s expenditure: instead, it comes
from the creation of new money via the expansion of the banking sector’s liabilities and assets.

The key outcome is that Credit does not cancel out, as it does in Loanable Funds: there is a
single entry for Credit in aggregate expenditure – it finances part of the Household sector’s
purchases from the Manufacturing sector – and a single entry in aggregate income – where it is
part of the Manufacturing sector’s income:

Consequently, in the model shown in table 2.4 – and in the real world – credit is a source of
both aggregate demand and aggregate income. It could only be ignored if it were empirically
trivial relative to expenditure and income generated by the turnover of existing money, but this
is clearly not the case: credit was as high as 15.3 per cent of US GDP in the fourth quarter of
2006, and as low as −5.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2009. In Spain, the range was even
larger: from 34.4 per cent of GDP in Q2-2007 to −19.4 per cent in Q3-2013. Credit is both
significant, and far more volatile than the other components of aggregate expenditure.
It is, therefore, the explanation for the real-world phenomena of debt-deflationary crises like
the Great Recession, the Great Depression and the Panic of 1837. Neoclassical economics, by
ignoring banks, debt and money in its macroeconomic models, is ignoring the main factors that
drive economic performance and also cause economic crises.

2.4 Negative credit, economic crises and economic
policy
Neoclassical economists appropriated Nassim Taleb’s phrase ‘The Black
Swan’ (Taleb 2010) to assert that the Great Recession was impossible to
predict, because crises like it are so rare, and because their causes are
fundamentally random. Called ‘exogenous shocks’ by Neoclassicals,
random events are the only factors that cause Neoclassical models of the
economy to deviate from equilibrium. Therefore, ‘exogenous shocks’ must
have caused the Great Recession. The Boston College Economics Professor
Peter Ireland put it this way:
In terms of its macroeconomics, was the Great Recession of 2007–09 really
that different from what came before? The results derived here from
estimating and simulating a New Keynesian model provide the answer:
partly yes and partly no.
These results suggest that largely, the pattern of exogenous demand and
supply disturbances that caused the Great Moderation to end and the Great
Recession to begin was quite similar to the patterns generating each of the
two previous downturns in 1990–91 and 2001. Compared to those from
previous episodes, however, the series of adverse shocks hitting the US
economy most recently lasted longer and became more intense,
contributing both to the exceptional length and severity of the Great
Recession. (Ireland 2011, p. 51, emphasis added)
The policy prescription from this analysis is to do ... nothing at all, beyond
the Boy Scout motto of ‘be prepared’. From the perspective of the
Neoclassical paradigm, crises like the Great Recession can’t be anticipated,
let alone made less likely by economic policy. We can only deal with their
consequences after they happen.
This is akin to Aristotle’s theory of comets (which was preserved in
Ptolemaic astronomy) that comets were unpredictable, because they were
atmospheric phenomena (Aristotle 350 bce [1952], Part 7). The Copernican
scientific revolution, which overthrew this worldview, showed that comets
were inherently predictable, as they are celestial objects orbiting the Sun.
## 19

Similarly, the ‘unpredictability’ of crises like the Great Recession is a
product of the Neoclassical paradigm’s false Loanable Funds model of
money. The correct BODM model shows that crises are caused by credit
turning negative (Vague 2019), and that most recessions are caused by
credit declining, but not quite going negative. This causal relationship
between credit (which is identical in magnitude to the annual change in
private debt) and economic performance endows capitalist economies with
a tendency to accumulate higher and higher levels of private debt. This
phenomenon is most evident in that most capitalist of economies, the
United States of America (see figure 2.9).
Figure 2.9. Private debt and credit in the USA since 1834
Figure 2.9 identifies America’s three great economic crises: the Great
Recession, the Great Depression, and the ‘Panic of 1837’. What, you
haven’t heard of the ‘Panic of 1837’? Neither had I before I produced this

chart, using historical Census data (Census Bureau 1949, 1975).
## 20
## After I
did, I knew there had to have been a crisis then, and found that the ‘Panic of
1837’ was described at the time as ‘an economic crisis so extreme as to
erase all memories of previous financial disorders’ (Roberts 2012, p. 24).
In each of these crises, credit plunged from a historically high level, turned
negative, and remained negative for a substantial period (see table 2.5).
Each crisis turned around only when the decline of credit stopped. But the
renewed growth engendered by rising credit came at the expense of a rising
private debt-to-GDP ratio, with this rise terminated either by another crisis,
or by wars that drove the private debt ratio down dramatically because of
the ‘war economy’ boost to GDP: nominal GDP growth reached 32 per cent
p.a. during the US Civil War in 1861–5, 29 per cent during the First World
War (1914–18), and 29 per cent again during the Second World War (1939–
45), far exceeding the maximum growth rate of credit during those periods
(0.2 per cent of GDP p.a., 8.6 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively).

a
This is measured from the first negative month to the last, but includes
some periods of positive credit (most of 1839, and late 1935 till late 1936).
This is no way to run an economy, but it is what we are stuck with while
economic policy is dominated by a theory of economics that ignores banks,
private debt, money and credit. However, with a new, monetary paradigm,
several things become evident: we should stop the level of private debt
from getting too high, and credit-based demand should not be allowed to
become too large a component of aggregate demand (Bezemer and Grydaki
## 2014).

2.5 An integrated view of deficits and credit
One striking feature of figure 2.6 is the rarity of government surpluses,
despite the never-ending political rhetoric about achieving them. The only
period of sustained surpluses was the 1920s, when the government
maintained a surplus of roughly 1 per cent of GDP each year. The ‘Roaring
Twenties’, as the decade became known, was a time of great economic
prosperity, and in his 1928 State of the Union Address, President Calvin
Coolidge attributed this success to the government surplus:
No Congress of the United States ever assembled, on surveying the state of
the Union, has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at
the present time ... a surplus has been produced. One-third of the national
debt has been paid ... the national income has increased nearly 50 per cent
... That is constructive economy in the highest degree. It is the corner stone
of prosperity. It should not fail to be continued. (Coolidge 1928)
In fact, the surplus was depressing the economy, by taking the equivalent of
just under 1 per cent of GDP out of private bank accounts every year. At the
same time, the private sector was borrowing on average 5 per cent of GDP
every year, and using this to gamble on financial assets in an orgy of debt-
fuelled speculation, initially in a forgotten but significant housing bubble
(Vague 2019), and then in the stock market.
As Coolidge lauded himself for causing government debt to fall from 30 per
cent to 15 per cent of GDP, private debt rose from 55 per cent to 100 per
cent of GDP. All was good as the private debt level rose, because as
explained earlier, positive credit adds to aggregate demand (for speculative
assets as well as goods and services, though the former doesn’t turn up in
GDP). But when debt stopped rising, credit turned negative, and aggregate
demand collapsed, as did the stock market. Far from being ‘the corner stone
of prosperity’, Coolidge’s surpluses helped pave the road to the Great
## Depression.
We can avoid Coolidge’s mistake of attributing all of the economy’s
performance during the 1920s to the government surplus by building a
simple Minsky model that integrates government money creation via deficit
spending, and bank money creation via credit – see figure 2.10. In this

simplified model, government spending and taxation is summarized by a
deficit, and private bank money creation is summarized by credit, both of
which can be either positive or negative.
Figure 2.10. The banking sector’s view of a mixed fiat-credit economy. See
http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
One general point this model illustrates is worth mentioning: for an
operation to create or destroy money in a modern banking system, one of its
two entries must occur on the asset side of the private banking system’s
ledger, and the other must occur on the liabilities side. Government deficits,
private bank credit, and Treasury Bond sales to the public, all qualify;
Treasury sales of bonds to private banks, and central bank purchases of
bonds from private banks, do not.
The simulation shown in figure 2.11 is a counterfactual to Coolidge’s
laudatory portrayal of his surplus. It marries the same surplus – 1 per cent
of GDP per year – to a private sector also trying to achieve the same aim –
to pay its debt to the banking sector down by 1 per cent of GDP per year.
The result, after a transient period of growth as the model settles down from
its initial conditions, is a declining GDP. With both the government and
non-bank public trying to reduce indebtedness, both are instead reducing
the money supply. With money turning over more than once per year, GDP
falls faster than debt falls, and ‘Fisher’s Paradox’ asserts itself as the private
debt-to-GDP ratio starts to rise:

Figure  2.11. An integrated view of government deficits and private sector
credit. See http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
liquidation defeats itself. While it diminishes the number of dollars owed,
... it increases the value of each dollar owed. Then, the very effort of
individuals to lessen their burden of debts increases it, because of the mass
effect of the stampede to liquidate in swelling each dollar owed. Then we
have the great paradox which, I submit, is the chief secret of most, if not all,
great depressions: The more the debtors pay, the more they owe. (Fisher
1933, p. 344)
Fisher himself acquired this wisdom the hard way. He was his day’s Paul
Krugman: a famous mainstream economist (and also inventor) who also
wrote a column for the New York Times. He took the profits from his
inventions and levered them into the stock market with margin debt, which
in the 1920s allowed a speculator to put down a deposit of $1,000 and
borrow $9,000, to buy $10,000 worth of shares with a $10,000 ‘margin
account’.
## 21
The borrower paid interest on the loan of course, but the leverage meant
that, if markets rose 10 per cent, then before expenses, the speculator
doubled his money: $10,000 worth of shares became $11,000, doubling the
speculator’s net worth from $1,000 to $2,000. But there was a catch: if the
market fell 10 per cent, then the speculator had to top up the account to
keep it at $10,000. This would wipe the speculator’s equity out – from

$1,000 to zero (before expenses). If the speculator couldn’t comply with his
ready cash, then the stockbroker was entitled by the margin contract to
liquidate any of the speculator’s assets: it was an unlimited liability. Most
speculators were confident that this would never happen, and for most of
the decade, they were right: while the margin debt-to-GDP ratio increased
5.5 times between the stock market’s all-time low point in 1921 and
October 1929, the stock market itself rose sixfold.
## 22
Then the stock market
jitters began, which Fisher downplayed. On 16 October 1929, he was
quoted in the Times as saying at a conference that ‘Stock prices have
reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.’ He continued:
I do not feel that there will soon, if ever, be a fifty or sixty point break
below present levels, such as Mr. Babson has predicted. I expect to see the
stock market a good deal higher than it is today within a few months.
(Fisher 1929, p. 8, emphasis added)
Just two weeks later, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged over 60
points in two days, losing more than 20 per cent of its value. Margin calls
wiped out levered speculators like Fisher immediately, and took the
economy down with it, because margin debt had exploded from a mere 1
per cent of GDP in the early 1920s to 13 per cent in October 1929 (see
figure 2.12). This is why the Twenties roared – and largely also why the
Thirties wailed.

Figure 2.12. Margin debt and the stock market’s cyclically-adjusted price-
to-earnings ratio (CAPE) since 1910
The collapse of margin debt from over 13 per cent to under 1 per cent of
GDP in the first two years of the 1930s was the chief reason that the Stock
Market Crash of 1929 was so deadly, compared to subsequent crashes in
1987, 2000 and 2007, and why it ushered in the Great Depression, which
itself did much to cause the rise of fascism and the Second World War.
As awful as those crises were, they had one strong positive economic side-
effect, from which the next generation – the Baby Boomers – benefited
handsomely. The combination of massive government spending and
constrained private sector consumption during the Second World War
enabled the deleveraging that commenced in 1933 to continue. By the end
of the war, private debt had fallen to 33 per cent of GDP, from its deflation-
driven peak of 130 per cent in 1932 (see figure 2.9). This low level of
private debt, along with the substantial level of fiat-based money created

during the Second World War, low interest rates and regular government
deficits, meant that the financial burden on the private sector in the 1950s
and 1960s was trivial. It was as if the slate had been wiped clean by a
classical debt jubilee.
Not realizing any of this, and certainly not understanding the incredible
reluctance of their parents and grandparents to go into debt, after the
tribulations of the 1970s and early 1980s, the Baby Boomers restarted the
borrowing bubble, culminating in the telecommunications, dotcom and
finally subprime bubbles, which drove private debt to its highest level in US
history (and in most of the rest of the developed world). After this crisis,
with Neoclassical economists of the Baby Boomer generation in charge of
government policy, private debt fell by only 20 per cent from its Great
Recession peak of 170 per cent of GDP. Even before Covid-19, it was well
above the previous peak in 1932. We need to reduce private debt back to its
levels during that Golden Age – but we should find a better way of doing so
than another world war.

## 2.6 A Modern Debt Jubilee
The monetary perspective developed in the previous sections shows that the
real-world roles of private and public debt, and of credit and government
deficits, are the exact opposite of what the Neoclassical conventional
wisdom asserts. Private debt, not government debt, is the primary cause of
economic crises (Bezemer and Grydaki 2014; Jordà et al. 2011; Keen
2020b; Vague 2019; Zhang and Bezemer 2014). Credit, and not government
deficits, is dangerous when it is large relative to GDP. Rising private debt,
not rising government debt, is the main indicator of an approaching crisis.
Private debt, not government debt, can depress economic activity because it
is too high. These insights indicate that the levels of private debt and credit
are economic indicators of at least as much importance as the customary
ones of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. They should be
monitored as closely, and economic policy should aim to keep them both
relatively low.
But that leaves the issue of what to do when Neoclassical economics, by not
only ignoring private debt, but also by actively arguing in favour of debt
financing of business instead of equity financing (Modigliani and Merton
1958; Wigglesworth 2020), has helped drive private debt to at least three
times its Golden Age level. If capitalism is ever to have another Golden
Age, then we need to reduce the private debt-to-GDP ratio by at least as
much as it was reduced during the 1930s and 1940s. This could be done in
exactly the same way that the government runs a deficit today, in a way that
does not advantage those who gambled with borrowed money over those
that did not, and without causing inflation – and even, if it is so desired,
without increasing aggregate demand – by what I call a Modern Debt
## Jubilee.
Figure 2.13 shows the basic accounting logic of a Modern Debt Jubilee
(Coppola 2019; Hudson 2018). Firstly, the Treasury issues every adult
resident, debtor and saver alike, the same sum of fiat-based money. If this
amount were $100,000 per American over 15 years old, the total in 2021
would be $24 trillion – 70 per cent of the level of pre-Covid private sector
debt, and roughly 110 per cent of GDP. Those who had bank debt would be
required to reduce it by that amount. Those who were debt free, or whose

debts were less than $100,000, would be required to buy newly-issued
corporate shares, the revenue from which would have to be used to cancel
corporate debt, and replace it with equity.
Figure 2.13.  Accounting for  a  Modern Debt Jubilee. See
http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
The banks would not lose out in this process. Instead, their reserves would
rise by precisely as much as their debt-based assets would fall. Then, they
would use these excess reserves to buy Jubilee Bonds, the interest on which

would generate an income stream for banks, in partial compensation for the
loss of income from interest on household and corporate debt.
No additional money, or spending power, would be created directly. Instead,
there would be an increase in fiat-backed money, and an equivalent decline
in credit-backed money. For corporations, shareholder equity would rise,
and corporate debt would fall. Private debt would go from 150 per cent of
GDP (pre-Covid-19) to 40 per cent of GDP – roughly the level it was at the
start of the Golden Age of Capitalism.
This would also reduce the obscene increase in inequality that has been the
direct and deliberate result of the program of ‘Quantitative Easing’ (QE)
that the Federal Reserve has followed since 2010. As Bernanke himself put
it in an OpEd for The Washington Post, ‘higher stock prices will boost
consumer wealth and help increase confidence, which can also spur
spending. Increased spending will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in
a virtuous circle, will further support economic expansion’ (Bernanke
2010). QE, which initially saw the Fed promise to be a net buyer of bonds
from banks to the tune of $80 billion per month, or almost $1 trillion per
year, encouraged financial corporations to buy shares in place of the bonds
they had sold to the Fed.
QE was the major factor in the rise of the S&P500 from its nadir of 666 in
early 2009 to almost six times as much in 2020. This boosted wealth
dramatically – but only the wealth of those who owned shares. The vast
majority of the population own no shares directly, and only a trivial fraction
of the stock market’s overall valuation via pension schemes and the like.
This policy decision, made by and undertaken by the Neoclassical
economists who run the Federal Reserve, amplified the inequality already
created by the preceding debt-financed bubbles – a point I’ll elaborate upon
in the next chapter. It is a policy mistake that should be reversed, and a
Modern Debt Jubilee could do it.
You will, I hope, already know that QE didn’t involve any taxes. It was
entirely a Federal Reserve action, because the increase in the Fed’s
liabilities – the huge rise in the reserves of private banks – was matched by
an equivalent increase in the Fed’s assets, its holdings of both government
and corporate bonds. Unlike QE, a Modern Debt Jubilee would necessarily
involve the Treasury, as shown in figure 2.13, and the negative equity

generated for the Treasury would be identical to the positive equity created
for savers and debtors (and the banking system, via interest payments on
## Jubilee Bonds).
A Modern Debt Jubilee could thus help us escape the debt trap that
Neoclassical economics has led us into. The next step is to stop that trap
from recurring, by taming the ‘roving cavaliers of credit’.
OceanofPDF.com

2.7 Taming ‘the roving cavaliers of credit’
Some of Marx’s greatest and truest rhetorical flourishes occurred in Chapter
33 of Volume III of Capital (Marx 1894, Chapter 33), when he discussed
the financial system:
A high rate of interest can also indicate, as it did in 1857, that the country is
undermined by the roving cavaliers of credit who can afford to pay a high
interest because they pay it out of other people’s pockets (whereby,
however, they help to determine the rate of interest for all), and meanwhile
they live in grand style on anticipated profits. Simultaneously, precisely this
can incidentally provide a very profitable business for manufacturers and
others. Returns become wholly deceptive as a result of the loan system ...
Talk about centralisation! The credit system, which has its focus in the so-
called national banks and the big money-lenders and usurers surrounding
them, constitutes enormous centralisation, and gives this class of parasites
the fabulous power, not only to periodically despoil industrial capitalists,
but also to interfere in actual production in a most dangerous manner – and
this gang knows nothing about production and has nothing to do with it.
(Marx 1894, Chapter 33, emphasis added)
Marx’s disparaging outsider’s remarks about bankers are confirmed by
insider accounts today, including that of ex-banker and philanthropist
Richard Vague, whose A Brief History of Doom (Vague 2019) is a
magisterial account of the role of bankers, credit and debt in causing all of
the world’s major economic crises before Covid-19.
## 23
Vague acknowledges, as I do, the creative role that credit can play in a
capitalist economy:
Take away private debt, and commerce as we know it would slow to a
crawl. The world suffered crisis after crisis in the 1800s, but per-capita-
GDP increased thirtyfold in that century, and private debt was integral to
that growth. Many of those nineteenth-century crises were rooted in the
overexpansion of railroads, but they left behind an impressively extensive
network of rails from which countries still benefit. (Vague 2019, p. 16)

But he echoes Marx from insider knowledge about the incentives for
irresponsible over-lending that are rife in banks:
... financial crises recur so frequently ... that we have to wonder why
lending booms happen at all. The answer is this: growth in lending is what
brings lenders higher compensation, advancement, and recognition. Until a
crisis point is reached, rapid lending growth can bring euphoria and
staggering wealth ... Lending booms are driven by competition, inevitably
accompanied by the fear of falling behind or missing out ...
Having spent a lifetime in the industry, I can report that there is almost
always the desire to grow loans aggressively and increase wealth ... So the
better and more profound question is, why are there periods in which loan
growth isn’t booming? ... when lenders are chastened – often in the years
following a crisis. (Vague 2019, pp. 7–8)
While financial instability cannot be wholly eliminated from capitalism –
for reasons that will become evident in the next chapter – the most
egregious elements of irresponsible bank lending can be addressed by
limitations on what banks are allowed to lend for. These limitations should
be part and parcel of being granted the privilege and power to create money
that comes with a banking licence, especially since history provides ample
evidence that, without controls, this privilege will be abused. They should
constrain or eliminate lending that finances asset price bubbles, and direct
lending as much as is possible towards investment and essential
consumption rather than speculation.
Once the role of credit in aggregate demand is understood, it’s easy to
extend this to asset markets, in which credit plays a major role. With
mortgage debt as the main means by which houses are purchased, there is a
causal relationship between new mortgages – or mortgage credit – and the
house price level. There is, therefore, a link between change in mortgage
credit and change in house prices (Zhang and Bezemer 2014). The same
logic applies to change in margin credit and change in stock prices. The
correlation between change in mortgage credit and change in house prices
since 1971 is 0.64, while the correlation between change in margin credit
and change in Shiller’s CAPE index since 1990 – when margin debt began
to rise again after fifty years of being below 0.5 per cent of GDP – is also
0.64 (see figure 2.14).

Figure  2.14.  Change  in  household credit  and  change in  house prices
## (correlation 0.64)
This type of borrowing drives asset price bubbles, and does precious little to
benefit society. We need means by which this kind of borrowing can be
discouraged, while lending for productive purposes can be enhanced.
2.7.1 ‘The pill’
At present, if two individuals with the same savings and income are
competing for a property, then the one who can secure a larger loan wins.
This reality gives borrowers an incentive to want to have the loan-to-
valuation ratio increased, which underpins the finance sector’s ability to
expand debt for property purchases.
I instead propose basing the maximum debt that can be used to purchase a
property on the income (actual or imputed) of the property itself. Lenders
would only be able to lend up to a fixed multiple of the income-earning
capacity of the property being purchased – regardless of the income of the

borrower. A useful multiple would be 10, so that if a property rented for
$30,000 p.a., the maximum amount of money that could be borrowed by
anyone to purchase it, regardless of their income, would be $300,000.
Under this regime, if two parties were vying for the same property, the one
that raised more money via savings would win. There would therefore be a
negative feedback relationship between leverage and house prices: a general
increase in house prices would mean a general fall in leverage. This would
also encourage treating housing as it should be treated: a long-lived
consumer good, rather than an object of speculation.
2.7.2 Jubilee shares
The key factor that allows Ponzi schemes to work in asset markets is the
‘Greater Fool’ promise that a share bought today for $1 can be sold
tomorrow for $10. No interest rate, no regulation, can hold against the
charge to insanity that such a feasible prospect foments. The vast majority
of activity on the stock market is also the sale of existing shares by one
speculator to another, which raises no capital for the company in question.
The primary market – the sale of new shares by a company to raise capital –
is trivial by comparison.
I propose the redefinition of shares in such a way that the enticement of
limitless price appreciation can be removed, and the primary market can
take precedence over the secondary market. A share bought in an IPO
(initial public offering) or rights offer would last forever (for as long as the
company exists) as now, with all the rights it currently confers. It could be
sold into the secondary market with all the same privileges. But on a
subsequent sale, say the fifth, it would have a life span of fifty years, at
which point it would terminate.
The objective of this proposal is to eliminate the appeal of using debt to buy
existing shares, while still making it attractive to fund innovative firms or
start-ups via the primary market, and still making purchase of the share of
an established company on the secondary market attractive to those seeking
an annuity income.
This basic proposal might be refined, while still maintaining the primary
objective of making leveraged speculation on the price of existing shares
unappealing. The termination date could be made a function of how long a

share was held; the number of sales on the secondary market before the
Jubilee effect applied could be altered. But the basic idea must be to make
borrowing money to gamble on the prices of existing shares a very
unattractive proposition.
2.7.3 Entrepreneurial equity loans
Entrepreneurs, in Schumpeter’s compelling vision of their role in
capitalism’s development (Schumpeter 1934), are people with a good idea
but no money with which to turn these ideas into products. Today, credit to
entrepreneurs from banks is almost non-existent, and for good reason: most
entrepreneurs will fail, and banks that lend to them lose their capital, while
only securing an interest-rate return from those entrepreneurs who succeed.
One way to encourage banks to lend to entrepreneurs in return for equity,
rather than debt, is via ‘entrepreneurial equity loans’ (EELs). Banks would
still lose money on those entrepreneurs that failed, but could make a capital
gain as well as a flow of dividends on those entrepreneurs who succeeded.

2.8 Shifting the monetary paradigm
I am often asked what I would keep of Neoclassical economics in a new
paradigm. My answer is that I would keep as much of Neoclassical
economics as modern astronomy kept of Ptolemaic astronomy – which is to
say, nothing at all.
On its own, that answer may seem both arrogant and flippant: surely there
is something of value in all the work done by Neoclassical economists? Yes,
there are skerricks of merit in the entire edifice. But I hope that it is evident
after this chapter on money that nothing of worth remains of the
Neoclassical perspective on money and banking, once the reality that banks
create money is accepted. Rather than being irrelevant to macroeconomics,
banks, private debt and money are essential. Rather than playing no role in
macroeconomics, credit is a significant component of aggregate demand
and income, and, given its volatility, it is the ‘causa causans’ (Keynes 1937,
p. 221) that drives macroeconomics. Financial crises, rather than being
‘Black Swans’, are products of credit turning negative. Private debt, not
government debt, is dangerous when it is high relative to GDP.
Governments should normally run deficits to create identical surpluses for
the non-government sectors. Government debt does not burden future
generations but instead generates monetary assets for current ones.
All the Neoclassical arguments about money are invalid: there is nothing
left to keep. The same applies to the next, more technical failing of
Neoclassical economics: its obsession with modelling the economy as if it
has a stable equilibrium.

## Notes
1  In a delicious irony, Bernanke found himself in charge of the
Federal Reserve when ‘It’ – a crisis akin to the Great Depression –
happened again in 2007.
2   The Bank of England papers cited the Post Keynesian authors
Nicholas Kaldor, Basil Moore, Thomas Palley, Josh Ryan-Collins,
Richard Werner and Andrew Jackson, as well as Michael Kumhof,
who is arguably the only Neoclassical economist to both understand
that banks create money, and to appreciate its macroeconomic
significance.
3   This includes the 10th edition, published in 2019.
4   The exception to this rule is Michael Kumhof of the Bank of
## England.
5  As the anthropologist David Graeber pointed out, the vision
promulgated by economists from the time of Adam Smith on, of
ancient economies that used barter evolving into money-using
economies today, is a myth: ‘The story, then, is everywhere. It is the
founding myth of our system of economic relations. It is so deeply
established in common sense, even in places like Madagascar, that
most people on earth couldn’t imagine any other way that money
possibly could have come about. The problem is there’s no
evidence that it ever happened, and an enormous amount of
evidence suggesting that it did not. For centuries now, explorers
have been trying to find this fabled land of barter – none with
success’ (Graeber 2011).
6  Godley Tables can have multiple equity accounts, to enable
modelling of short-term and long-term equity, but in this book, for
simplicity, I only consider a single short-term equity account.
7   There are some assets – such as consumer durables that you own
outright – which are an asset to you and a liability to no-one else. In
this book, I model only financial claims that are assets to one

person and liabilities to another, so that the sum of all equity is
necessarily zero.
8  Irony alert.
9  In this simple model, where no distinction is made between short-
term (at-call) and long-term bank equity, the money supply includes
bank equity. A more sophisticated model would have payments
made to an at-call account of the banking sector.
10 I did not fully appreciate this point myself, prior to reading
Stephanie Kelton’s The Deficit Myth (Kelton 2020), and then
building Minsky models to check – and confirm – her argument.
Before then, if asked whether deficits created money, I would
sometimes answer ‘to the extent that they are monetized by the
central bank’. As you will soon see, central bank bond purchases
are irrelevant to money creation.
11 The construct of the ‘banking sector’ lumps together many
independent financial institutions. In the real world the part of the
banking sector that actually buys Treasury Bonds are called
‘primary dealers’. Some are banks, whose reserves are directly
increased when the government net spends on its account holders;
others are merchant banks and the like who might need to borrow
reserves from banks.
12 See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_monetization: ‘Debt
monetization or monetary finance is the practice of a government
borrowing money from the central bank, which, in the process of
buying the debt, creates new money. It is one of the practices often
informally called printing money. This practice allows a
government to finance its deficit without creating money directly –
which is prohibited in many countries – and also without increasing
debt to private parties.’
13 As with selling bonds to the central bank, the banks only make such
sales if they profit from them, and these trading profits aren’t
shown here, though they could easily be included in a more
elaborate model.

14 Whether it generates real wealth depends, in our modern fiat world,
on how much it causes under-utilized capacity to be used, versus
how much it could drive up prices or generate a trade deficit. For
those who know MMT well, this last comment indicates that I
reject the MMT position on foreign trade, which I interpret as
encouraging trade deficits. This aspect of MMT is not derived from
its monetary insights, but from the aphorism that ‘Imports are real
benefits and exports are real costs’ (Mosler 2010, p. 59), which I
believe contradicts MMT’s monetary insights.
15 Phillips’ work has been badly misinterpreted – even on the usual
standards of Neoclassical scholarship. He was in fact one of the
pioneers of dynamic modelling in economics, and his work was on
a par with, and possibly even more advanced than, Forrester’s at the
same time. See Phillips (1950, 1954, 1956, 1957, 1959, 1968) for
his work on building dynamic economic models using techniques
adapted from engineering.
16 The argument that the Federal Reserve alone controls the rate of
money growth is the reason that Friedman ignored two obvious
triggers to high inflation during the 1970s, the two OPEC-inspired
hikes in the price of oil, firstly in 1973 (marked on figures 2.7 and
2.8) after the Yom Kippur War, and then again in 1979 after the
Iranian Revolution (at the same time as Volcker formally
implemented monetarism, also marked on figures 2.7 and 2.8).
Both events quadrupled its price, from $2.50 a barrel to $10 in
1973, and from $10 to $40 in 1979. Monetarist dogma ignored this
by insisting that causation runs solely from the money supply to
prices; reality instead shows that causation works both ways, with –
as Moore explains in ‘The Endogenous Money Stock’ (Moore
1979) – changes in wages and raw material prices leading to growth
in the money supply.
17 Total monetary income is higher than shown in a Moore Table,
because it excludes spending internal to a sector – manufacturers
spending on other manufacturers, etc. However, in the limit – when
all entities in an economy are treated separately – then a Moore
Table captures total aggregate income and expenditure.

18 The amounts A, B, etc. in table 2.3 don’t have to be the same
numerical amounts as in table 2.2.
19 Though their orbits, like that of all astronomical bodies, are also
chaotic, as Poincare proved in 1899.
20 Figure 2.9 combines data from the Bank of International
Settlements from 1952 with data from the US Census from 1916 till
1970 (Census Bureau 1975, tables X398 and X580). The data series
are different in composition and scale, but they fortunately overlap
(BIS/Federal Reserve data cover 1946 till today; one Census series
covers 1916 till 1970; the other covers 1834 till 1970), and the rates
of change are very similar. The data in figure 2.9 rescale the two
earlier series to match the scale of the BIS data.
21 After the 1929 stock market crash, the maximum level of gearing
was reduced to 50 per cent – so that $1,000 could purchase a
portfolio valued at $2,000.

generous of my approximately 1,500 supporters on Patreon at

24 These loans need not cede any management control to banks,
something many entrepreneurs have told me they dread, given the
short-term focus of bankers and their lack of technical knowledge
outside finance itself.

Our complex world
Three of the most complex systems we know about are the human brain,
which enables you to read this book, the economy, which is its subject, and
the biosphere, in which both our brains and our economy evolved.
These systems are called complex, not because they are complicated –
though of course, they are – but because they interact – both within
themselves, and with each other – in complex ways. Neither our present,
nor our past, let alone our future, can be understood without acknowledging
the feedbacks that exist both between each of these systems, and within
them.
Today, the interactions between these systems have reached a fever-pitch.
Covid-19 has reminded us that we are part of the biosphere, rather than
separate from and above it. It laid waste to our economies, but the form and
magnitude of its damage were altered by how we, as a civilization, reacted
to it. In September 2020, it coincided with dramatic fires in much of the
western United States, and serious floods in the south due to a historically
high number of hurricanes. This coincidence made both problems worse,
because minimizing the spread of Covid-19 required isolating people, while
saving them from wildfires and floods required evacuating them en masse,
and housing them together in emergency facilities. One crisis compounded
the other.
Economics has attempted to deal with feedback effects via the concept of
equilibrium. The state of equilibrium is one in which the system’s key
variables are not changing. However, economists – even some non-
Neoclassical ones – claim that this state of rest ‘does not “ignore” time’, but
rather ‘allows enough time for changes ... to have their full effects’
(Steedman 1992, p. 146). Effectively, conventional economic theory has
taken the shortcut of working in terms of the equilibrium of the economic
system, rather than worrying about what it regards as the transient dynamics
of the approach to equilibrium. It assumes, in other words, that any cyclical
process will ultimately achieve a state of rest: feedbacks are presumed to
dampen oscillations over time.

A century ago, the mathematician Alfred Lotka proved that this
presumption is false, when he considered the dynamics of interacting
species – a predator species and its prey. In his example, the ‘prey’ was
grass, and the ‘predators’ were cows. Starting with a small number of cows
in a paddock, the amount of grass will grow, because there aren’t enough
cows to eat all the new grass. But this provides ideal conditions for cows to
breed, so the number of cows will rise. A larger number of cows will
ultimately consume grass at a faster rate than it grows, causing the paddock
to start to turn bare. As this starts to happen, there isn’t enough feed for all
the cows to survive, so some die of starvation, leading back to where we
started with a small number of cows. Figure 3.1 shows this as a cyclical
process.
Figure 3.1. The cyclical interaction of grass and cows
Lotka expected that this would lead to diminishing cycles over time, so that
the number of cows and the amount of grass would ultimately converge to
equilibrium values. Instead, he found, to his surprise, that the quantity of
both grass and cows would oscillate indefinitely:
It was, therefore, with considerable surprise that the writer, on applying his
method to certain special cases, found these to lead to undamped, and hence
indefinitely continued, oscillations. (Lotka 1920, p. 410)

Lotka’s discovery was the conception of what is today known as complex
systems analysis. An essential aspect of this approach is that you cannot do
what conventional economists do: you cannot use equilibrium as a short-
cut. For most complex systems, the equilibrium tells you not where the
system will ultimately end up, but where the system will never be. Rather
than converging to an equilibrium, complex systems tend to oscillate
indefinitely – as Lotka found in his model of cows and grass.
The dynamics of a ‘predator-prey’ model, as Lotka’s discovery was called,
are shown in figure 3.2, using the example of sharks and fish, rather than
cows and grass. The model has an equilibrium,
## 1
shown by the lines in the
time plots and the dot in the phase plot, but it is ‘neutral’: if the model starts
out of equilibrium, it will never converge to it, but neither will it move
further away.
Figure 3.2. A predator-prey model in Minsky, using sharks and fish. See
http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
One limitation of Lotka’s model was that the oscillations were always of the
same size and frequency, which is not what we observe in the real world.
Cycles in real-world systems like the economy are aperiodic: there are
booms and busts, but the amplitude and frequency of every boom and bust
is different to those that have gone before. Most of the very few economists

who knew of Lotka’s discovery ignored it for this reason. Instead, the
explanation of cycles that became dominant in economics was that they
were the result of external (‘exogenous’) shocks disturbing an otherwise
stable system. Ragnar Frisch, the founding editor of the journal
Econometrica, put it this way a decade after Lotka:
The majority of the economic oscillations which we encounter seem to be
explained most plausibly as free oscillations. In many cases they seem to be
produced by the fact that certain exterior impulses hit the economic
mechanism and thereby initiate more or less regular oscillations ...
[T]he source of energy which maintains the economic cycles are erratic
shocks ... New innovations and exploitations do not come regularly ...
these irregular jerks may cause more or less regular cyclical movements ...
‘If you hit a wooden rocking-horse with a club, the movement of the horse
will be very different to that of the club.’ (Frisch 1933, pp. 1, 28)
This rejection by economists of the complex systems argument that cycles
are endogenous – caused by dynamics within the economy itself, rather
than from shocks coming from outside the economy – was shown to be
invalid three decades later, by the discovery of what was called, for a while,
‘chaotic dynamics’ in weather systems. The discovery was first revealed in
a paper with the telling title of ‘Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow’ (Lorenz
## 1963).
At the time, meteorologists used linear models to try to predict the weather.
Edward Lorenz was dissatisfied with this, because one aspect of the
weather – for example, air temperature – influenced other aspects – such as
wind speed – nonlinearly. Changes in temperature would multiply wind
strength, and not merely add to it. To illustrate this, he took an extremely
complicated model of fluid dynamics and reduced it to a simple model with
just three variables (x, y and z) and three constants (a, b and c).
Superficially, this is only slightly more complicated than Lotka’s model,
which has two variables and four constants. But the behaviour was totally
different: the model generated cycles which varied in both amplitude and
frequency, in a way that appeared chaotic at first – but then Lorenz
discovered that, beneath the apparently ‘chaotic’ movements of the
variables x, y and z over time, lay the beautiful pattern of x or y plotted
against z that he dubbed the ‘Butterfly Effect’ (see figure 3.3).

Figure 3.3.  Lorenz’s  model of  aperiodic  cycles in  the  weather.  See
http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
Lorenz’s paper introduced the world to a whole new type of equilibrium:
the ‘strange attractor’. This is an equilibrium, which the system will
approach from some distance away, but from which it is repelled when it
gets closer. There are two strange attractors in Lorenz’s model, located in
the vacant spaces within the two butterfly wings. There are three equilibria
in the model, all of which are unstable for realistic parameter values.
The essential feature causing this behaviour is the interaction of three or
more system variables in nonlinear ways. Both Lotka’s and Lorenz’s
models have nonlinear terms – terms where one variable is multiplied by
another. Lotka’s model generated periodic cycles of fixed magnitude
because he only had two species in it – though more can easily be added.
Lorenz’s model, with three variables, was the minimum number needed to

generate aperiodic cycles, like those we see in the real world (Li and Yorke
## 1975).
The reason why a dynamic system with three variables is so different to one
with two comes down to geometry: one of the rules of differential equations
is that, if you plot the values of a system’s variables against each other in
any one simulation, the paths can’t intersect. With two variables, the pattern
of one variable against another gives you a two-dimensional shape, like
something you can draw on a tabletop, without ever lifting your finger off
the table, and without ever crossing your path.
This leaves you with just five options: to spiral in, ultimately reaching a
point; to spiral out, ultimately running out of table; to spiral in, converging
on a curve (like a circle) but never actually getting there; to spiral out, also
converging on a circle; or to stay on a closed path forever – precisely
repeating the same pattern, rather than intersecting it.
## 2
With three variables, you get a three-dimensional shape – like a box. Now
repeat the same process in an imaginary box above your table. You can
easily draw complicated shapes, like Lorenz’s butterfly, without ever
intersecting your path.
Lorenz’s discovery transformed meteorology: one of the main reasons that
weather forecasts today are so much more accurate than they were half a
century ago – even with climate change destabilizing the weather – is
because meteorologists took Lorenz’s advice and built large-scale,
nonlinear models of the atmosphere. His discovery strongly influenced
most other physical sciences as well.
But economics, as a notoriously insular social science (Leijonhufvud 1973),
largely ignored Lorenz. Though a handful of economists, myself included,
took Lorenz’s results to heart, the vast majority continued with Frisch’s
approach of treating the economy as a stable system, whose fluctuations are
caused by ‘exogenous shocks’.
So complex systems models can explain aperiodic cycles in a system. Why,
apart from ignorance, do economists not analyse the economy as a complex
system, and continue to use Frisch’s invalid framework of a stable system
subject to exogenous shocks?

The one defence that could be made is just that: that the economy is ‘too
complex’ to model it either out of equilibrium, or with fundamentally
nonlinear components. There are many things that are much simpler to do
when you assume that you can ignore nonlinear interactions in a system.
For a start, a nonlinear system with three or more variables cannot, in
general, be solved analytically. Linear models, on the other hand, in general
can be solved. It is also much easier to estimate a linear model and fit it to
data than a nonlinear one. Linear models, even ones with lots of equations,
are inherently simpler than nonlinear models, even small ones, and the urge
to ‘keep it simple’ runs deep in all sciences.
But as Einstein was once paraphrased, the idea is to keep things ‘as simple
as possible, but no simpler’. Einstein’s actual statement was that:
It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the
irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having
to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.
(Einstein 1934, p. 165, emphasis added)
The best illustration that the very complicated, but fundamentally linear,
stable-equilibrium models that mainstream economists prefer violate this
principle is their failure to anticipate the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–
- In fact, as noted earlier (Cotis 2007, p. 7), 2008 was going to be a
fabulous year, according to these models. The predictions of the OECD’s
‘Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium’ model were the foundation of
the OECD’s optimistic forecasts in June 2007. Two months later, the crisis
commenced.
That’s the negative case against linear models, and equilibrium-oriented
models in particular. The positive case for the nonlinear, complex systems
approach in economics is the fact that the core phenomena that caused the
crisis can be generated by a very simple, fundamentally nonlinear, complex
systems model of the economy, which I first developed in 1992 (Keen
1995). This model motivated me to warn that a crisis was imminent from
December of 2005 (Bezemer 2010; Fullbrook 2010). Despite its simplicity
and stylized nature – or rather because of it, like Lorenz’s model of the
weather shown in figure 3.3 – it captures the essential features of the real
economy in the lead-up to the crisis:

the magnitude of economic cycles diminished – a phenomenon which
mainstream ‘Neoclassical’ economists interpreted as a good thing, and
for which then Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman Ben Bernanke took the
credit, on behalf of the Federal Reserve and the Neoclassical
economists who dominate it (Bernanke 2004a);
the distribution of income shifted away from the poor (workers) and
towards the rich (bankers), which economists observed but could not
explain (nor did they care much about it); and
the level of private debt rose compared to GDP, which they also
ignored.
I built this model to express the ideas of one of the great non-Neoclassical
economists, Hyman Minsky, after whom the program Minsky was named.
OceanofPDF.com

3.1 A complex systems model of economic
instability
Minsky developed his theory of systemic instability in capitalism by asking
a simple question: ‘Can “It” – a Great Depression – happen again?’. To
answer this question, Minsky reasoned that ‘it is necessary to have an
economic theory which makes great depressions one of the possible states
in which our type of capitalist economy can find itself’ (Minsky 1982, p.
xi). His verbal model focused upon the dual role of private debt of both
enabling investment in excess of profits, and constituting a burden to
investment when debt was too high relative to income. He put it this way:
The natural starting place for analyzing the relation between debt and
income is to take an economy with a cyclical past that is now doing well ...
As the period over which the economy does well lengthens, two things
become evident in board rooms. Existing debts are easily validated and
units that were heavily in debt prospered; it paid to lever ... As a result,
over a period in which the economy does well, views about acceptable debt
structure change ... As this continues the economy is transformed into a
boom economy.
Stable growth is inconsistent with the manner in which investment is
determined in an economy in which debt-financed ownership of capital
assets exists, and the extent to which such debt financing can be carried is
market determined. It follows that the fundamental instability of a capitalist
economy is upward. The tendency to transform doing well into a speculative
investment boom is the basic instability in a capitalist economy. (Minsky
1982, p. 66, emphasis added)
The basic causal process that Minsky envisaged was that:
in the aftermath of a recession, both firms and banks are conservative
about debt; therefore only conservatively estimated projects receive
funding;
because of this conservative leverage, most projects succeed – leading
to firms and banks becoming more adventurous;

additional borrowing finances more investment, and the economy
booms, but private debt also grows;
the boom drives up wages and raw material costs, reducing profits at
the peak of the boom;
investment falls, and the economy enters another recession;
wages and raw material prices fall, restoring profitability, but at a
higher level of debt than before; and
the cycle repeats, until ultimately debt is so high that interest on debt
exceeds profits, and the economy enters a Great Depression.
This process can be captured in an extremely simple causal chain:

Capital determines Output;
## 3
- Output determines Employment;
- The rate of employment determines the rate of change of wages;
- Output minus Wages and Interest payments determines profit;
## 5.
The profit rate determines the level of investment,
## 4
which is the
change in Capital – which takes us back to the beginning of this
causal chain; and
- The difference between investment and profits determines the change
in (private) debt.
With Minsky, or any other system dynamics program, we can turn this step-
by-step verbal chain into a mathematical model. Surprisingly, though no
assumptions are made about cycles or income distribution in this verbal
chain, the real-world phenomena of rising debt, diminishing and then rising
cycles, and shifting income distribution from the poor (workers) to the rich
(bankers) all emerge in a simulation of this model (see figure 3.4).

See http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
What you’re witnessing is an instance of a common phenomenon in
complex systems models: ‘emergent properties’, properties which the
model displays, but which weren’t built into the model by its assumptions
or formulas. Instead, they ‘emerge’ from the interactions of the system’s

variables: in this case, the employment rate, the wages share of GDP and
the level of private debt relative to GDP.
The two key emergent properties of this model are that:
even though workers do no borrowing in this simple model, they are
the ones who effectively pay for the higher level of debt, via a fall in
their share of GDP, while that going to capitalists remains constant –
inequality rises because the increase in (relatively rich) bankers’ share
of income is equal to the fall in the (relatively poor) workers’ share;
and
cycles diminish and appear to disappear, only to return later and
become more and more extreme.
What causes these two emergent properties – the fact that workers, rather
than firms, end up paying for the higher level of debt; and the phenomenon
of falling and then rising cycles?
The first property occurs because this model is driven by the desire of
capitalists to invest, as manifest in the investment equation, where the rate
of profit determines the share of investment in total GDP. This implies some
rate of profit at which investment precisely equals profit: in the simulations
here, that’s a 4.3 per cent rate of profit, or a 12.9 per cent share of GDP
going to capitalists. That leaves 87.1 per cent of GDP to be divided between
workers and bankers, and it doesn’t matter to capitalists how that is
allocated between them. The dynamics of the model then push income
towards bankers and away from workers.
Employment rises as the economy starts to boom because of higher
investment, and this ultimately leads to a high rate of employment, which
drives up wages. Since investment in excess of profits is debt-financed, the
debt ratio also rises during the boom, so that debt servicing costs rise as
well. These rising wage and interest costs ultimately mean that the profits
expected by capitalists when the boom began are not realized. The
increased share of output going to workers and bankers leaves less than
capitalists had expected as profits. Investment falls, the rate of growth of
the economy falters, and the boom gives way to a slump.
The slump reverses the dynamics that the boom set in train, but doesn’t
quite reverse the impact of the boom on private debt. Aggregate demand

falls, leading to falling employment and declining wages; but at the same
time, lower cash flows after the crisis mean that actual debt servicing falls
short of what was planned. The recovery from the crisis thus leaves a
residue of unpaid debt.
The profit share of output ultimately returns to a level that once again sets
off another period of euphoric expectations and high debt-financed
investment, but this starts from a higher level of debt relative to GDP than
before. With a higher level of debt, the larger share of income going to
bankers leaves a lower share for workers. So the workers pay the price for
the higher debt level in terms of a lower wages share of GDP, even though
they do no borrowing themselves.
Mathematicians know the second emergent property – of cycles
diminishing and then growing larger as the crisis approaches – as the
‘intermittent route to chaos’. It was first discovered in fluid dynamics
(Pomeau and Manneville 1980) in the analysis of Lorenz’s weather model,
which we discussed earlier. It can only be fully explained mathematically,
but I’ll try my best in words here. If you don’t have mathematical training,
this might be a good point to take a coffee break.
A critical part of the phenomenon of complex or ‘chaotic’ behaviour is the
‘nonlinearity’ of the model. Because the model has terms involving the
multiplication of one system state by another – say, the debt ratio multiplied
by the workers’ share of GDP – the effect of this interaction is very different
when the model is far from an equilibrium than when it is close to it. A long
way from the equilibrium, the product of the difference of each of these
variables from their equilibrium values is very big: this can, in some
circumstances, push the system back towards the equilibrium. But as they
approach the equilibrium, the magnitude of this product falls very quickly –
in the same way that x squared is much bigger than x when x is greater than
one, but much smaller than x when x is less than one: x squared is 4 when x
is 2, but ¼ when x is ½. So, far from equilibrium, the nonlinear terms in a
model dominate the linear terms, whereas close to the equilibrium, the
linear terms dominate the nonlinear ones.
## 5
This means, rather paradoxically, that while the nonlinear terms mean that a
nonlinear model behaves very differently far from equilibrium, the linear
terms determine the stability of an equilibrium.
## 6
This is why the behaviour

of a nonlinear model is very different from the fundamentally linear models
that Neoclassicals typically build: in a linear model, if the equilibrium is a
‘repeller’ – if it pushes the system away, rather than pulling it closer – then
it is a repeller far from equilibrium, as well as close to it. That will
inevitably mean that the model gets pushed beyond its sensible bounds: you
get negative quantities of goods, or negative prices, which are meaningless
in an economic model.
But in a nonlinear model, the behaviour near the equilibrium can be very
different from the behaviour far from it. If the equilibrium is a repeller close
up – where the linear terms dominate – then it can also be an attractor far
away – where the nonlinear terms dominate. This is why a complex system
can fluctuate indefinitely – it doesn’t have to converge to equilibrium.
Things get more complicated still when you delve into the nature of the
forces pushing or pulling the system around. Estimated in proximity to a
model’s equilibria, these are called ‘eigenvalues’ and ‘eigenvectors’, in
which ‘eigen’ is a German word meaning ‘characteristic’. Eigenvalues tell
you how strong the forces are pulling the system towards an equilibrium, or
pushing away from it, and eigenvectors tell you the orientation of that push
or pull.
Eigenvalues are derived by putting the system’s equations into a matrix, and
then expressing the forces applied to a position close to the equilibria of the
matrix equation as a polynomial – an equation in x, x
## 2
, x
## 3
and so on.
Factoring this equation with just the terms in x gives you the eigenvalues of
a model. They can be positive, in which case they ‘repel’ the system from
its equilibrium, or negative, in which case they attract, or ‘complex’, in
which case they cause cycles. Complex numbers are the factors of quadratic
terms like, for example, (x
## 2
+1), where the roots involve the square root of
minus one.
The complex eigenvalues – which cause cyclical behaviour – also have a
real number in them, which can be negative, positive or zero. If the real
number is negative, the cycle will converge to the equilibrium; if it is
positive, the system will diverge from the equilibrium; if it is zero, the
system will cycle around the equilibrium, but neither move closer to it nor
further away.

The overall behaviour of a model near an equilibrium depends on the
interaction of all its eigenvalues, and the most important issue here is the
sign of the largest real number, which identifies the system’s ‘dominant’
eigenvalue. If this is negative, then the equilibrium is stable, and if the
system starts near enough to the equilibrium, it will converge to it over
time. If it is positive, however, then the equilibrium is unstable, and the
system will diverge from it over time. The balance of forces also depends
on how far the system is from an equilibrium, which is defined in terms of
its ‘basin of attraction’ and ‘Lyapunov function’ (see Grasselli and Costa
Lima 2012 for an example of applying this stability analysis to the model in
figure 3.4). As I said, it’s complicated (take another coffee break if your
head is spinning at this point!).
The model in figure 3.4 has two meaningful equilibria, one of which has
been characterized as the ‘good equilibrium’ (Grasselli and Costa Lima
2012). This has a positive employment rate, a positive wages share of
output and a finite debt ratio (the other ‘bad equilibrium’ has zero
employment, zero wages share and an infinite debt ratio). The linearized
equation for the good equilibrium has one negative eigenvalue – which
means that it attracts the system towards the equilibrium – and one pair of
complex eigenvalues (they always come in pairs). For low values of the
parameter that gives the slope of the investment function, these complex
eigenvalues have zero as their real part. This makes zero the ‘dominant
eigenvalue’ – since zero is bigger than a negative number – but because
zero neither attracts nor repels, the negative real eigenvalue can still push
the system towards the equilibrium over time.
However, for larger values of the slope of the investment function, the real
part of the complex eigenvalues becomes positive, and then it’s ‘game over’
for the stability of the ‘good equilibrium’. When the system is sufficiently
far away from the equilibrium, the nonlinear forces dominate, dragging the
system from its starting point (its ‘initial conditions’) towards the
equilibrium, and the magnitude of the cycles falls as well. But as the system
approaches the equilibrium, the linear forces dominate, and the positive
component of the complex eigenvalue dominates the negative component of
the real eigenvalue. The system starts to move away from the equilibrium,
and the cycles get bigger, not smaller. That’s what we see in the model
shown in figure 3.4, and I saw this phenomenon in a simulation of my

original model, before I worked out its stability characteristics using the
techniques described here (Grasselli and Costa Lima 2012; Keen 1995,
## 2020b).
## 7
This was not a prediction of Minsky’s verbal model: though he had
famously written that ‘Stability – or tranquility – in a world with a cyclical
past and capitalist financial institutions is destabilizing’ (Minsky 1978, p.
10), this was in reference to a single cycle, not the pattern of cycles over
time. When I first constructed this model in August 1992, this phenomenon
of falling and then rising cycles was in many ways its most surprising
feature, and I ended the paper with what I thought at the time was a great
rhetorical flourish:
From the perspective of economic theory and policy, this vision of a
capitalist economy with finance requires us to go beyond that habit of mind
that Keynes described so well, the excessive reliance on the (stable) recent
past as a guide to the future. The chaotic dynamics explored in this paper
should warn us against accepting a period of relative tranquility in a
capitalist economy as anything other than a lull before the storm. (Keen
1995, p. 634)
Then, much to my amazement at the time, the real world began to emulate
my model. Each new recession after 1980 came with a lower peak level of
unemployment (Komlos 2021),
## 8
and each new boom with a lower peak
level of inflation, while the level of private debt rose far faster than GDP
(see figure 3.5).

Figure  3.5. Declining cycles in employment and inflation, while private
debt rises
With their linear, equilibrium-fixated approach to modelling, Neoclassical
economists saw this phenomenon as a vindication of their economic theory
and the policies based upon it, and extrapolated this trend forward in their
models. They labelled the decline in economic volatility the ‘Great
Moderation’, and attributed it to their economic policies, which emphasized
reducing inflation using Federal Reserve control of short-term interest rates.
Ben Bernanke, then a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,
was particularly effusive in his praise for ‘the Great Moderation’:

As it turned out, the low-inflation era of the past two decades has seen not
only significant improvements in economic growth and productivity but
also a marked reduction in economic volatility, both in the United States
and abroad, a phenomenon that has been dubbed ‘the Great Moderation.’
Recessions have become less frequent and milder, and quarter-to-quarter
volatility in output and employment has declined significantly as well ...
there is evidence for the view that improved control of inflation has
contributed in important measure to this welcome change in the economy.
(Bernanke 2004b, emphasis added)
My reaction, in contrast, was that this pattern, which emulated my simple
model, was the harbinger of a future crisis. That crisis arrived in late 2007,
and it was, before Covid-19, the most serious economic crisis since the
Great Depression. Unemployment shot up above the level of all previous
post-war recessions,
## 9
while inflation gave way to deflation.
Neoclassical economists were caught totally unawares by this crisis, and in
the aftermath to it there were some admissions that their models had
weaknesses. But they could see no alternative to their core approach, which
was to attempt to derive macroeconomic models from the foundation of
microeconomics – a practice that they describe as ‘microfoundations’.
The pursuit of a widely accepted analytical macroeconomic core, in which
to locate discussions and extensions, may be a pipe dream, but it is a dream
surely worth pursuing ... Starting from explicit microfoundations is clearly
essential; where else to start from? (Blanchard 2016)
The belief that macroeconomics had to be derived from microeconomics
took hold in the 1980s, as the previously dominant ‘IS-LM’ macroeconomic
models were replaced by ‘Real Business Cycle’ models, which were
directly derived from microeconomic concepts of utility-maximizing
consumers and profit-maximizing firms. As then President of the American
Economic Association Robert Lucas put it, ‘Nobody was satisfied with IS-
LM as the end of macroeconomic theorizing. The idea was we were going
to tie it together with microeconomics and that was the job of our
generation’ (Lucas 2004, p. 20).
Complexity theory has shown that the belief that macroeconomics must be
derived from microeconomics is false.

3.2 Complexity and the impossibility of
microfoundations
Do yourself a favour: read one of the best and most accessible thought
pieces ever penned by a scientist: Physics Nobel Laureate Philip Anderson’s
‘More is Different’ (Anderson 1972).
## 10
The paper itself arose in a
methodological dispute within physics over the role of ‘reductionism’ in
science. This is the practice of understanding a complicated field by
breaking it down into its constituent parts, understanding them
independently, and then building your knowledge of the whole from the
parts. Anderson acknowledged the success of reductionism in enabling us to
develop modern science, but he pointed out that reductionism does not
imply ‘constructionism’:
The ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply
the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. (Anderson
1972, p. 393)
Speaking as one of the original researchers who discovered complex
systems phenomena in science, Anderson noted that while ‘constructionism’
works for simple systems with simple (often linear) relationships between
their parts,
The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin
difficulties of scale and complexity. The behavior of large and complex
aggregates of elementary particles, it turns out, is not to be understood in
terms of a simple extrapolation of the properties of a few particles. Instead,
at each level of complexity entirely new properties appear, and the
understanding of the new behaviors requires research which I think is as
fundamental in its nature as any other. (Anderson 1972, p. 393)
Anderson noted that it was possible to rank sciences according to the
principle that ‘The elementary entities of science X obey the laws of
science Y’:

## XY
Solid state or many-body physicsElementary particle physics
ChemistryMany-body physics
Molecular biologyChemistry
Cell biologyMolecular biology
## ......
PsychologyPhysiology
Social SciencesPsychology
But this hierarchy does not imply that science X is ‘just applied Y.’ At each
stage entirely new laws, concepts, and generalizations are necessary,
requiring inspiration and creativity to just as great a degree as in the
previous one. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied
chemistry. (Anderson 1972, p. 393)
Mainstream economists, however, are driven by the belief that
macroeconomics should be ‘just applied microeconomics’: making it so has
been their research agenda for the last thirty years.
In general, this is foolhardy: imagine, for example, that the same belief took
over biology, so that biologists believed that ‘Molecular Biology is just
applied Chemistry’. Then a valid Molecular Biology laboratory project
would be ‘Create life from its fundamental chemicals’. Of course, that’s
impossible: despite all the knowledge chemists have of chemistry today,
and biologists of biology, no-one knows how to turn chemicals into a life
form, though clearly this happened in the distant past on Earth (Cornell et
al. 2019). Therefore, Biology cannot be reduced to ‘Applied Chemistry’: if
Chemists did in fact insist that Biology must meet this standard, then there
would be no science of Biology at all.
In particular in economics, economists have already shown that this
objective – to reduce macroeconomics to applied microeconomics – is
impossible. In a well-known but misleadingly interpreted result called the
Sonnenschein–Mantel–Debreu theorem (Arrow et al. 1981–1993; Gorman
1953; Kihlstrom et al. 1976; Shafer and Sonnenschein 1982; Sonnenschein
1973a, 1973b), mathematical economists posed the question ‘is it possible
to derive a downward-sloping market demand curve by aggregating the

demand curves of numerous individuals, all of whom have downward-
sloping individual demand curves?’. Their answer was that it was not,
unless you assumed, to quote the first economist to derive this result, that
‘the Engel curves for different individuals at the same prices are parallel
straight lines’ (Gorman 1953, p. 63). Gorman unpacked his economic
jargon with this telling assertion:
The necessary and sufficient condition quoted above is intuitively
reasonable. It says, in effect, that an extra unit of purchasing power should
be spent in the same way no matter to whom it is given. (Gorman 1953, p.
## 64)
There is nothing ‘intuitively reasonable’ about that condition: it is saying
that Elon Musk will spend an extra dollar buying the same things that a
homeless person would buy with that dollar.
## 11
This is obviously untrue, and
intuitively unreasonable: why does Gorman claim the exact opposite?
It is because, if the distribution of income does affect consumption – and it
obviously does – then the market demand curve that can be derived by
summing the downward-sloping individual demand curves of numerous
individuals can have any shape at all:
## 12
it does not have to be downward
sloping. With that discovery, the whole theory of ‘supply and demand’ dies.
As other researchers in this field put it, ‘The utility hypothesis tells us
nothing about market demand unless it is augmented by additional
requirements’ (Shafer and Sonnenschein 1982, p. 672).
This is a classic ‘emergent property’. Not only can macroeconomics not be
derived from microeconomics, even the model of a market demand curve
can’t be derived – with the properties Neoclassical economists want it to
have – from the model of a single consumer. The quest for a
microeconomics foundation for macroeconomics is futile.
But a quest for firm foundations does make sense: what might they be?

3.3 The macrofoundations of macroeconomics
In what may seem a paradox, macroeconomics can be derived directly from
itself.
Macroeconomics is about economic aggregates, and much of it involves
ratios of one aggregate to another. We worry about the rate of
unemployment, which is the ratio of those unemployed to the workforce;
income distribution is concerned with how much of income goes to
particular groups, compared to total income; even the rate of economic
growth is the ratio of the change in GDP to its current level. These
macroeconomic aggregates and their ratios define the subject, and a
dynamic macroeconomics can be derived by simply converting these
definitions into statements about change over time.
In other words, the structure of the economy largely determines how it
behaves. This structure is codified to a substantial extent in macroeconomic
definitions themselves. By simply taking core definitions and turning them
into dynamic statements, we can build the foundations of macroeconomics.
As we expand the definitions – for example, by going beyond treating GDP
as a simple number and consider a range of industries producing a range of
products – then the mathematical form of that expanded definition will give
us a richer model still. There is no need to drill down to microeconomics,
let alone build up from it towards macroeconomics – and as I explain in
Debunking Economics (Keen 2011), virtually all of conventional
microeconomics is bunk anyway.
Consider the model of Minsky’s ‘Financial Instability Hypothesis’ shown in
figure 3.4. The three key ratios in that model are the employment rate, the
wages share of GDP and the debt ratio:

As they stand, these are ‘static’ definitions: they define ratios that are true
for all time, but they don’t describe the process of change of those ratios
through time. However, we can derive statements about that process of
change by ‘simply’ differentiating them with respect to time.
Well, that’s simple for people who ‘speak’ mathematics, but if you don’t,
there’s another simple trick using percentages that makes this easy: the
percentage rate of change of a ratio is equal to the percentage rate of
change of the numerator, minus the percentage rate of change of the
denominator. Similarly, the percentage rate of change of a product (say,
Wages defined as the Wage Rate times Labour) is the sum of the percentage
rates of change of the two parts of the product.
So, just by looking at the definitions shown in equation (3.1), we can write
them in a dynamic form:
The percentage rate of change of the Employment Rate is equal to the
percentage rate of change of the Labour force, minus the percentage
rate of growth of Population;
The percentage rate of change of the Wages Share of GDP is the
percentage rate of change of Wages, minus the percentage rate of
change of GDP; and
The percentage rate of change of the Debt Ratio is the percentage rate
of change of Debt, minus the percentage rate of change of GDP.
Using the same functions for wage change and investment as in figure 3.4,
and the same assumption that debt finances investment in excess of profits,
this leads to a model which has precisely the same dynamics. There are
issues with some of these definitions which would need to be addressed in
more sophisticated models
## 13
(Harcourt 1972; Robinson 1964, 1971a,
## 1971b; Samuelson 1966; Sraffa 1960),
## 14
but just as Lorenz’s highly stylized
model of turbulence is a key foundation of modern meteorology, the model
we have developed here is a key foundation for a genuinely modern
macroeconomics – and not one scintilla of microeconomic reasoning was
involved.
It was also a relatively easy exercise to construct this model, compared to
the painful process that Neoclassical economists must go through, using
their invalid ‘microfoundations’ approach, to build even the simplest of

their equilibrium-fixated Real Business Cycle models – let alone their
attempt at greater realism with ‘Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium’
models. As the leading Neoclassical modeller Olivier Blanchard put it:
Thinking in terms of a set of distortions to a competitive economy implies a
long slog from the competitive model to a reasonably plausible description
of the economy. But, again, it is hard to see where else to start from.
(Blanchard 2018, p. 47)
No such unnecessary hard work is required to build this model, and it can
be extended by generalizing the definitions used. For example, the impact
of inflation can be considered by replacing ‘real’ GDP as used here with
nominal GDP, where real GDP equals nominal GDP divided by the Price
level. The rate of inflation then turns up in two of the model’s three
equations. The abstraction of a single number for GDP can be replaced by
the reality that it is really the sum of the outputs of numerous different
industries. Non-productive ‘Ponzi’ uses of debt can be introduced alongside
debt being used to finance investment. Government spending can be
introduced – a topic we explored in the previous chapter – and so on.
Macroeconomics can guide its own development, once we abandon the
constructionist fallacy that it should be derived from microeconomics.
If a foundational layer for macroeconomics is sought, it should be a link
with the fundamental physics of how our civilization transforms the mineral
and biological gifts the biosphere provides into the industrial products we
consume, and the waste we necessarily dump back into the biosphere. That
has not been done, and largely cannot be done, by Neoclassical economists.

## Notes
1  It actually has two, with the equilibrium of zero predators and zero
prey being unstable.
2  Mainstream economics has been constructed as if only the first two
possibilities exist, which is why they persist with the false
assumption that a system’s equilibrium – the point you converge to
in the first case – is stable.
3  In the next chapter I show that it is the energy that capital turns into
useful work that determines output. As I show in Modelling with
Minsky, this is consistent with the models in this chapter, because
what is called the ‘capital to output ratio’ in these models is actually
the efficiency with which energy is turned into useful work.
4  Other factors, such as a target level of capacity utilization, could
have been used in the investment equation, but would have resulted
in a more complicated model, when the intention was to build the
simplest possible model. The uncertainty of the future, in Keynes’s
sense, turns up here in the overly strong reliance both workers and
capitalists make upon current conditions, as expressed in the current
level of employment and the current level of profits: ‘It would be
foolish, in forming our expectations, to attach great weight to
matters which are very uncertain. It is reasonable, therefore, to be
guided to a considerable degree by the facts about which we feel
somewhat confident, even though they may be less decisively
relevant to the issue than other facts about which our knowledge is
vague and scanty. For this reason the facts of the existing situation
enter, in a sense disproportionately, into the formation of our long-
term expectations; our usual practice being to take the existing
situation and to project it into the future, modified only to the extent
that we have more or less definite reasons for expecting a change’
(Keynes 1936, Chapter 12).
5  Most complex systems can be approximated by a polynomial,
which is derived from the original model using what is known as a

Taylor series expansion. The linear part of this is the coefficient for
the term in x. The nonlinear part are the terms in x squared, x cubed,
and so on.
6  Consequently, the stability of a model with an unstable equilibrium
can’t be ‘saved’ by adding more complicated terms to it: it’s the
simplest terms that make it unstable.
7   There is a typesetting error in one of the equations in the 1995
paper that turned a negative into a positive. If you wish to explore
this model yourself, please use the equations in the 2020 paper
instead.
8   The recorded rate of unemployment drastically understates the
actual level, and all changes to the formal definition have reduced
the recorded level: not one has caused the recorded level to rise.
9   The lower recorded peak level of unemployment in 2010 than 1983
was due to redefinitions of unemployment since 1983. If the pre-
1983 definition had been used in 2010, the recorded unemployment
rate would have been substantially higher.

(a) don’t take the pen off the page, (b) don’t cross the curve at any
point and (c) don’t draw above it so that there are two or more y
values for one x value. This is not to say that demand curves one

might construct from economic data would have ‘any shape at all’,
but rather that Neoclassical economists cannot explain one
fundamental aspect of their theory, the ‘Law of Demand’.
13 For example, the assumption that the relationship between capital
and output is a constant. The ratio is actually declining, but slowly:
it has been between 3.9 and 3.1 for the United States for the last
seventy years – see https://myf.red/g/vRx1. I’ll address how to
interpret this relationship in the next chapter. Investment could be
made to depend on other factors as well – such as a target level of
capacity utilization, which is a common assumption in Post
Keynesian models.
14 There are also serious problems about defining an aggregate
amount of capital, which the references given here explore in what
was known as ‘the Cambridge Controversies’. They are more
damaging to Neoclassical economics than other approaches because
Neoclassical theory asserts that the quantity of capital determines
the return to capital. That problem of a circular definition does not
apply to the models in this chapter, where the return to capital is a
residual after wages and interest payments have been deducted.

Economics, energy and the environment
Most economists treat Adam Smith as ‘the father of economics’. I disagree.
Though I appreciate some of Smith’s work, I primarily regard him as the
person most responsible for causing economics to deviate from the
physically realistic approach that economics should have taken, which was
established by his intellectual predecessors, the Physiocrats.
The key difference between Smith and these long-forgotten pre-Classical
economists were their respective views about how output and wealth are
created. This is obvious when one compares the very first sentences of
Smith’s The Wealth of Nations (Smith 1776) to Cantillon’s An Essay on
Economic Theory (Cantillon 1755). Cantillon attributed all wealth to land:
Land is the source or matter from which all wealth is drawn; man’s labor
provides the form for its production, and wealth in itself is nothing but the
food, conveniences, and pleasures of life. (Cantillon 1755, p. 21)
Smith, using very similar language, attributed the wealth of nations to
labour:
The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it
with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually
consumes. (Smith 1776, p. 10)
Both authors had roles for the other’s nominated primary factor in their
analysis. However, by emphasizing labour over land, Smith set economics
on a course which, two centuries later, resulted in models of production in
which output is treated as being generated by labour and capital alone.
Neoclassicals use the ‘Cobb–Douglas Production Function’ (Cobb and
Douglas 1928), in which output is produced by a flexible combination of
labour and capital; Post Keynesians use the ‘Leontief Production Function’,
in which output is proportional to the fraction of the capital stock that is in
use.

Neither have any explicit role for inputs from outside the economy,
from the natural world which existed long before humans did – let alone
humanity’s modern industrial society.

The Physiocratic approach, in contrast, asserted that without the ‘free gift’
of Nature (Turgot 1774, p. 16), there would be no production at all. Though
this could not be known at the time, from the point of view of modern
physics, the Physiocrats were correct and Smith was wrong – and so too,
therefore, are modern models of production, because they pretend that
output can be produced without inputs from nature, and also, without waste.
Both these beliefs are fallacies, according to the Laws of Thermodynamics.
## 2
The key ‘free gift of Nature’ is energy: without energy, not only can no
work be done, life itself can’t exist. Figure 4.1 illustrates the basic principle:
useful work can be done if there is a gap between the heat of a source of
energy and its environment, and only if that environment is at absolute zero
can all the energy in the source be turned into useful work. Waste can be
minimized, but not eliminated: it is inevitable when energy is used to
perform useful work.

Though the laws are difficult to understand, their impact is not: any theory
which violates them is false. This was put beautifully by the early
twentieth-century physicist Arthur Eddington, when he abstractly
considered theories that violate the most mind-bending of these laws, the
Second Law, that the degree of disorder of a closed system – known as its
‘entropy’ – necessarily rises over time:

The law that entropy always increases holds, I think, the supreme position
among the laws of Nature. If someone points out to you that your pet theory
of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell’s equations – then so much
the worse for Maxwell’s equations. If it is found to be contradicted by
observation – well, these experimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But
if your theory is found to be against the Second Law of Thermodynamics I
can give you no hope; there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest
humiliation. (Eddington 1928, p. 27)
Economics has violated these laws ever since the Physiocrats, whose
correct speculations about production emanating from the ‘free gift of
Nature’ actually predate the invention of the word ‘energy’ by half a century
(Smith 1998). This ignorance has persisted despite the staggeringly tight
correlation that exists between global energy use and global GDP (see
figure 4.2).

Figure 4.2. The correlation between change in global energy consumption
and change in global GDP is 0.83
Therefore, if you don’t explicitly – or at least implicitly – capture the role of
energy in production in your economic model, your economic model is
wrong, both theoretically and empirically. At the very least, energy must be
included in economic models of production (including the models shown in
the previous chapter of this book), in a manner that is consistent with the
Laws of Thermodynamics. And yet, to date, apart from the work of
iconoclasts like Boulding (Boulding 1973, 1992), Georgescu-Roegen
(Georgescu-Roegen 1970, 1979, 1986), Daly (Daly 1991a, 2009), Smil
(Smil 1987, 2017), Hall (Hall et al. 2001; Hall and Day 2009) and Kümmel,
Ayres and colleagues (Ayres 1978; Ayres and Voudouris 2014; Ayres et al.
2013; Kümmel 2011; Kümmel et al. 2010, 2015), economics has effectively
ignored the role of energy in production.
An insight that occurred to me in 2016, while I was staying at Bob Ayres’s
house in Paris – which was full of sculptures – led to a simple way to

overcome this weakness: ‘capital without energy is a sculpture’ and ‘labour
without energy is a corpse’ (Keen et al. 2019, p. 41). Without energy, a
machine is just a static object that can do nothing. With energy, the
machine, managed by labourers, can perform work, and hence generate
what we call GDP. Energy can therefore be incorporated into models of
production simply by treating both labour and capital as means by which
energy is harnessed to perform useful work.
## 4
In mathematical terms, the input for ‘capital’ (or more correctly, the number
of machines) in the standard economic models of production should be
replaced by the ‘number’ of machines, times the energy consumed by each
machine per year, times the efficiency with which that energy is turned into
useful work – and the same thing should be done for ‘labour’ (or the
number of hours worked per year). When this is applied to both the
Neoclassical Cobb–Douglas and the Post Keynesian Leontief production
functions,
## 5
it resolves several long-lasting conundrums in economics.
These models now correctly state the importance of energy in production.
In contrast, the way in which Neoclassical economists have attempted to
incorporate energy into the Cobb–Douglas production function – by tacking
energy on as a third, independent input on the same footing as labour and
capital (Stiglitz 1974a, 1974b) – implied that if energy input dropped by 80
per cent, output would fall by a mere 8 per cent. This was justifiably
ridiculed by Larry Summers:
There’d be a set of economists who’d sit around explaining that electricity
was only four percent of the economy, and so if you lost eighty percent of
electricity you couldn’t possibly have lost more than three percent of the
economy, and there’d be people in Minnesota and Chicago and stuff who’d
be writing that paper ... but it would be stupid. (Summers 2013)
With the energy-modified Cobb–Douglas function (shown in footnote 5 to
this chapter), and standard values for its coefficient, output would fall 33
per cent if energy input fell by 80 per cent. This still seriously understates
what would actually happen, but it is at least in the right ballpark. With the
energy-modified Leontief function, the fall in output is identical to the fall
in energy, which is clearly consistent with the data shown in figure 4.2,
where there is an almost 1 for 1 relationship between changes in GDP and
changes in energy.

The stunning – but, from the point of view of the Laws of
Thermodynamics, utterly expected (Garrett 2012a, 2012b, 2014; Garrett et
al. 2020)
## 6
– correlation between change in energy and change in GDP
shown in figure 4.2 also provides a strong reason to reject the Cobb–
Douglas function and prefer the Leontief. The Cobb–Douglas function’s
exponent is normally derived from income distribution data, and reflects the
profit share in GDP. There are numerous theoretical problems with this
derivation (McCombie 1998, 2000; Shaikh 1974, 2005; Sraffa 1960), and
Mankiw added a strong empirical problem as well when he pointed out that,
with this conventional exponent, the cross-country predictions that the
Cobb–Douglas model makes are wildly at variance with the empirical data:
the model can explain incomes that vary by a multiple of slightly more than
two. Yet income per person varies by a multiple of more than ten ... the
model predicts convergence at about twice the rate that actually occurs ...
the profit rate ... should be about 1,000 percent per year in poor countries.
(Mankiw et al. 1995, pp. 283, 285, 287)
Mankiw notes that these problems disappear if the coefficient for capital is
of the order of two-thirds rather than one-third, and for other reasons he
recommends a coefficient of 0.8. At this level, the Cobb–Douglas function
makes much more realistic predictions about the impact of a reduction in
energy inputs on economic output: for example, it predicts a 1.6 per cent
fall in GDP for a 2 per cent fall in energy consumption. But the much
simpler Leontief model, using coefficients derived from the empirical fit
shown in figure 4.2, implies a 2 per cent fall in GDP from a 2 per cent fall
in energy inputs. This is a much better fit to the data from a much simpler
model, which, via Occam’s Razor, implies that the more complicated Cobb–
Douglas function should be dispensed with in favour of the Leontief.
The empirical failure of the Cobb–Douglas model arises from what its
proponents see as its greatest strength: it implies the possibility of
substituting one input for another, which the Leontief model does not do.
That was hypothetically a strength over the Leontief model when labour
and capital were the only inputs considered: it’s possible to imagine
substituting many workers for one machine (say, workers using shovels
versus an excavator). But there is no substitute for energy. Energy can be

used more efficiently, but this has limits, and efficiency of energy use is
included in the modified Leontief equation anyway.
The modified production equations also necessarily express the generation
of waste. Since the equations include a term for the efficiency with which
energy input is turned into useful work, the balance of that energy is waste
energy. The same thing applies when matter is included: if energy is used to
convert raw materials into useful materials, then production also generates
waste materials. This forges a fundamental link between economics and
ecology, in place of the Neoclassical treatment of pollution as an
‘externality’, which can hypothetically be reduced to zero with appropriate
property rights and pricing (Coase 1988; Major et al. 2016). To produce
output we must create waste; waste can be minimized but not completely
eliminated, and it must be dumped into the biosphere – at least while
production occurs only on Planet Earth – otherwise there can be no
production. Equally, production requires physical resources from the
environment, which is omitted from modern Neoclassical models, but
which can be incorporated into the Goodwin-based models used in chapter
3 (see figure 4.3), which incorporates a resource constraint into a Goodwin
model in which energy is the essential input to production.

Figure 4.3. A simple energy-based model with resource depletion and waste
production. See http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
Bringing energy into models of production also resolves the long-running
dispute over what is the source of economic growth over time – the surplus
of outputs over inputs – with an existential answer: there is no surplus.
Marx’s use of the Classical approach to economics, to argue that ‘surplus
value’ arose from the difference between the value of the wage workers
were paid and the value of the goods they produced, played a major role in
motivating the overthrow of the Classical School by the Neoclassical in the
late nineteenth century. The Neoclassical riposte was that labour and capital
together were responsible for the increase in utility from increasing
production over time. Post Keynesian economists simply accepted that a
surplus was produced, as did economists inspired by Piero Sraffa (Sraffa
1960), without speculating about what gave rise to it (Backhouse 1988;
Hamouda and Harcourt 1988).

All of these explanations fall foul of the Laws of Thermodynamics.
Production can be viewed as a decrease in entropy, or an increase in order:
we take raw materials and convert them into finished goods, with (outside
of recessions and crises like Covid-19) both the number and the
sophistication of the goods rising over time. This is only possible because
we are exploiting existing sources of energy – which, by the First Law, we
can neither create nor destroy – to cause a decrease in entropy in our system
of production. This decrease in entropy, when our frame of reference is the
economy, is only possible because of the overall increase in entropy, when
our frame of reference is the Universe.
Production, given the Second Law of Thermodynamics, is thus
fundamentally an operation that produces a deficit (an increase in entropy,
or ‘disorder’), rather than a surplus. Rather than capitalists exploiting
workers, as Marx argued, or capital and labour jointly causing a rise in
utility over time, as Neoclassicals assert, humanity’s social classes compete
for a share in the useful work created by the exploitation of pre-existing
energy – primarily, the planet’s fossil fuel reserves.

4.1 Our unsustainable future
This was never a sustainable situation. If you think otherwise – if you are,
perhaps, a climate change sceptic (many economists are) – then consider
this argument by a physicist (Murphy 2012). As our economies grow, their
use of energy grows.
## 7
With continued growth, we were bound to alter the
planet so much that our economy would end up destroying life on Earth –
and this has nothing to do with global warming. It is instead a consequence
of the Laws of Thermodynamics.
By the Second Law, using energy to perform useful work necessitates a
predictable amount of waste energy generation. At a sustained rate of global
economic growth of 2.3 per cent per annum – which is generally considered
too low today, since it would lead to continually rising unemployment – the
waste energy would increase the temperature of the surface of the Earth to
100°C some time in the twenty-fifth century:
## 8
at a 2.3% growth rate (conveniently chosen to represent a 10× increase
every century), we would reach boiling temperature in about 400 years.
(Murphy 2012)
Needless to say, life on Earth would have ended by then, and capitalism
well before that. The only way growth could be sustained for more than
another two centuries from today would be if humanity became ‘a multi-
planetary species’, to quote Elon Musk (Musk 2017). That could very
conceivably happen before the Laws of Thermodynamics drive us extinct.
But with global warming, we don’t have the luxury of centuries. We may
barely even have decades.
We have reached the point vividly described by Kenneth Boulding almost
thirty years ago, of a ‘spaceman economy’, rather than the ‘cowboy
economy’ in which capitalism originated:

The closed earth of the future requires economic principles which are
somewhat different from those of the open earth of the past. For the sake of
picturesqueness, I am tempted to call the open economy the ‘cowboy
economy,’ the cowboy being symbolic of the illimitable plains and also
associated with reckless, exploitative, romantic, and violent behavior, which
is characteristic of open societies. The closed economy of the future might
similarly be called the ‘spaceman’ economy, in which the earth has become
a single spaceship, without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for
extraction or for pollution, and in which, therefore, man must find his place
in a cyclical ecological system which is capable of continuous reproduction
of material form even though it cannot escape having inputs of energy.
(Boulding 1992)
Regrettably, we have reached this point blindly, since, of all the schools of
thought throughout the history of economics, only the Physiocrats had a
theory of value which was consistent with the Laws of Thermodynamics.
Though the Physiocrats erred in believing that only agriculture received the
‘free gift of Nature’ – when today we know that manufacturing and services
also exploit the free gift of energy via fossil fuels, nuclear and solar energy
– they were correct in seeing production as being fundamentally based on
turning what Nature provides ‘for free’ into commodities for sale. I pine for
the economics that could have developed had Cantillon, Turgot and
Quesnay provided the foundations of economics, rather than Adam Smith:
the produce of the land divides into two parts. The one comprehends the
subsistence and the profits of the husbandman, which are the rewards for
his labour, and the conditions on which he agrees to cultivate the field of the
proprietor; the other which remains, is that independent and disposable part,
which the earth produces as a free gift to the proprietor over and above
what he has disbursed; and it is out of this share of the proprietor’s, or what
is called the revenue, that he is enabled to live without labour, and which he
can carry where ever he will. (Turgot 1774, pp. 9, 15–16, emphasis added)
An economics built on these foundations could easily have had its error of
attributing all wealth to agriculture corrected, once physicists had
developed an understanding of energy. It would have correctly anticipated a
future world, far from the ‘cowboy economy’ in which economic theory
originated, when accumulated pollution and resource depletion could

undermine both production and the biosphere itself. Economists would have
expected continued growth to lead to ecological problems – and their
warnings would have been far more sophisticated than that provided by
Malthus (Malthus 1798). Economics would have warned us of the dangers
of exponential growth on a finite planet long before the process became a
threat to the continued existence of capitalism.
Instead, when ecological problems started to become evident in the 1970s,
economics was dominated by the Neoclassical school, which had by then
eliminated most, if not all, of the contrary perspective provided by Keynes.
All the failings of Neoclassical economics detailed in this book then turned
up in their work, which has vastly underestimated the dangers of climate
change. Given the primary role that economists have in shaping economic
policy, this has caused us to behave as ‘Wild West’ cowboys when we are
instead residents of the very precarious ‘Spaceship Earth’.
I can say only one thing in favour of the work by Neoclassical economists
on climate change: it is so bad that, once it becomes obvious how serious a
threat climate change is, revulsion at how Neoclassical economists have
trivialized the dangers may finally lead to the overthrow of Neoclassical
economics itself.

4.2 Revolution by revulsion
I have been a critic of Neoclassical economics since mid-1971, fifty years
before the publication of this book. The work done by Neoclassical
economists on climate change is, without doubt, the worst work that I have
encountered in that half-century (Keen 2020a).
According to these Neoclassical economists, the impact of climate change
upon the economy will be trivial. To cite the economics chapter of the 2014
report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):
For most economic sectors, the impact of climate change will be small
relative to the impacts of other drivers (medium evidence, high
agreement). Changes in population, age, income, technology, relative
prices, lifestyle, regulation, governance, and many other aspects of
socioeconomic development will have an impact on the supply and demand
of economic goods and services that is large relative to the impact of
climate change. (Arent et al. 2014, p. 662)
Similarly, William Nordhaus, who was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank
Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2018 ‘for
integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis’
(Nordhaus 2018a), asserted that a 6°C increase in global temperatures over
pre-industrial levels would reduce global economic output by a mere 8.5
per cent, compared to what it would have been in the complete absence of
climate change: ‘damages are 2.1 percent of global income at 3°C warming
and 8.5 percent of income at 6°C warming’ (Nordhaus 2018b, p. 345).
In an earlier survey paper, Nordhaus noted that the median prediction of his
eighteen respondents – the majority of whom were Neoclassical economists
– was that a 3°C increase in temperature by 2090 would cause a 3.6 per cent
fall in GDP. Stated in terms of the growth rate between 1991 and 2090, this
is a prediction that global warming ‘would reduce the growth of per capita
incomes from, say, 1.50 percent per year to 1.485 percent per year’
(Nordhaus 1994, p. 48). Given the imprecise methods by which economic
statistics are constructed, this predicted 0.015 per cent decline in the annual
growth rate is too small to measure: as one of his economist-respondents
put it, ‘I am impressed with the view that it takes a very sharp pencil to see

the difference between the world with and without climate change or with
and without mitigation’ (Nordhaus 1994, p. 48).
These sanguine beliefs bear no resemblance whatsoever to the world that
scientists envisage would exist on an Earth 6°C hotter than its pre-industrial
self. As climate scientist Tim Lenton observed in 2013, ‘There is currently a
huge gulf between natural scientists’ understanding of climate tipping
points and economists’ representations of climate catastrophes in integrated
assessment models (IAMs)’ (Lenton and Ciscar 2013, p. 585). We can get a
feel for how huge that gulf is by considering just three issues: the impact of
higher global temperatures on human physiology, on the range of the planet
that is inhabitable by other species, and on the structure of the atmosphere.
A critical feature of human physiology is our ability to dissipate internal
heat by perspiration. To do so, the external air needs to be colder than our
ideal body temperature of about 37°C, and dry enough to absorb our
perspiration as well. This becomes impossible when the combination of
heat and humidity, known as the ‘wet bulb temperature’, exceeds 35°C.
Above this level, we are unable to dissipate the heat generated by our
bodies, and the accumulated heat will kill a healthy individual within a few
hours. Scientists have estimated that a 3.8°C increase in the global average
temperature would make Jakarta’s temperature and humidity combination
fatal for humans every day of the year, while a 5.5°C increase would mean
that even New York would experience 55 days per year when the
combination of temperature and humidity would be deadly (Mora et al.
2017, fig. 4). In general, with a 5.5°C temperature increase, anywhere
between the ‘mid-latitudes (for example, 40°N or S) will be exposed to 60
deadly days per year’ (Mora et al. 2017, p. 504). That area is currently
home to 74 per cent of the world’s human population (Mora et al. 2017, p.
## 501).
Temperature also affects the viable range for all biological organisms on the
planet – not just humans. Scientists have estimated that a 4.5°C increase in
global temperatures would reduce the area of the planet in which life could
exist by 40 per cent or more, with the decline in the liveable area of the
planet ranging from a minimum of 30 per cent for mammals to a maximum
of 80 per cent for insects (Warren et al. 2018, fig. 1, p. 792).

The Earth’s current climate has three major air circulation systems in each
hemisphere: a ‘Hadley Cell’ between the Equator and 30°, a mid-latitude
cell between 30° and 60°, and a polar cell between 60° and 90°.
## 9
## This
structure is why there are such large differences in temperature between the
tropics, temperate and Arctic regions, and relatively small differences
within each region.
## 10
Scientists modelled the stability of these cells, and
concluded that they could be tipped, by an average global temperature
increase of 4.3°C or more, into a state with just one cell in the Northern
Hemisphere, and an average Arctic temperature of 22.5°C. This abrupt
transition (known as a bifurcation), some time in the next century, would
utterly alter weather patterns everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere,
profoundly disrupting all forms of life, and it would occur far too quickly
for any meaningful adaptation, by natural and human systems alike (Kypke
et al. 2020, fig. 6, p. 399).
These immense physical impacts expected by scientists cannot be
reconciled with the trivial economic impacts expected by economists. An
Earth that was on average 6°C hotter than pre-industrial levels (about 5°C
hotter than today) would be uninhabitable for humans, except perhaps
around the Poles, while those survivable regions would lack essential
supports for life – such as topsoil for agriculture, which takes thousands of
years to develop, in contrast to the century or so over which economists
have blithely considered that global temperatures would rise that much
(Nordhaus 2018a, Slide 6).
How did this ‘huge gulf’, as Tim Lenton put it, develop between ‘natural
scientists’ understanding of climate tipping points and economists’
representations of climate catastrophes in integrated assessment models’
(Lenton and Ciscar 2013, p. 585)? It developed because Neoclassical
economists (Nordhaus 2013; Nordhaus and Sztorc 2013) have utterly
misconstrued the work of climate scientists on this topic (Lenton et al.
## 2008).
In 2008, Lenton published the results of a survey of the informed opinions
of specialists on major components of the world’s climate, to estimate
which components could be triggered into a significant qualitative change
by increases in temperature that could be expected this century (Lenton et
al. 2008). Entitled ‘Tipping Elements in the Earth’s Climate System’, the
paper identified eight components that could be triggered, with two of these

– Arctic summer sea-ice and the Greenland ice sheet – highly likely to be
triggered. The paper’s conclusion opened with the following three
sentences:
Society may be lulled into a false sense of security by smooth projections of
global change. Our synthesis of present knowledge suggests that a variety
of tipping elements could reach their critical point within this century under
anthropogenic climate change. The greatest threats are tipping the Arctic
sea-ice and the Greenland ice sheet, and at least five other elements could
surprise us by exhibiting a nearby tipping point. (Lenton et al. 2008)
Nordhaus summarized these findings as follows in Chapter 5 of his book
The Climate Casino: Risk, Uncertainty, and Economics for a Warming
World (Nordhaus 2013):
Their review finds no critical tipping elements with a time horizon less than
300 years until global temperatures have increased by at least 3°C.
(Nordhaus 2013, p. 60)
In the manual to his DICE model (‘Dynamic Integrated Climate
Economy’), Nordhaus justified the use of a quadratic for his damages
function by this reference to Lenton:
The current version assumes that damages are a quadratic function of
temperature change and does not include sharp thresholds or tipping points,
but this is consistent with the survey by Lenton et al. (2008). (Nordhaus and
Sztorc 2013, p. 11)
These statements by Nordhaus do not summarize Lenton’s conclusions:
they contradict them. This affected not just Nordhaus’s own modelling of
climate change, but that of the entire, relatively small community of
Neoclassical economists working on climate change. Though some papers
and models pay lip service to the existence tipping points, all effectively
proceed as if there will be no tipping points triggered by temperature rises
expected this century.
However, the scientific literature is adamant that there will be tipping points
in the climate this century, unless drastic action is taken to reduce
humanity’s generation of CO
## 2
. A follow-up paper to Lenton et al. (2008)
concluded not only that ‘a planetary threshold in the Earth System could

exist at a temperature rise as low as 2°C above preindustrial’ temperatures
(Steffen et al. 2018, p. 8258), but also that one tipping point could trigger
‘tipping cascades’, in which one qualitative change (such as the
disappearance of Arctic summer sea-ice) could cause amplification effects
(such as the Arctic going from predominantly a reflector of solar energy to
an absorber) that made other tipping points occur (such as the termination
of the ‘Gulf Stream’ and other ocean currents). This process could push the
planet into a ‘hothouse Earth’ scenario (Steffen et al. 2018, p. 8252) with
vastly higher temperatures than today, and a climate no longer conducive to
human civilization – and possibly, also not conducive to human life.
The contrast between the research by scientists and the damage estimates
made by economists could hardly be starker. The 2014 IPCC Report
published a figure showing nineteen estimates by economists of the impact
on global income of levels of global warming from 1°C to 5.4°C above pre-
industrial temperatures (see figure 4.4). Even the most extreme estimate –
of a 12.4 per cent fall in GDP for a 3.2°C increase in temperature
(Maddison and Rehdanz 2011) – ignored the issue of tipping points, while
all these estimates are trivial compared to what can be inferred from the
scientific literature.

the assumed climate change.

a
The 23% fall for a 4°C temperature increase data point comes from Burke et al. (2015),
published after the IPCC Report. Even this most severe prediction in the Neoclassical economic
literature ignores tipping points.
There are, of course, no actual data on the relationship between the
temperature change due to global warming and GWP (‘gross world product’
– the planetary sum of ‘gross domestic product’), because global warming
of this scale hasn’t happened yet. Even the two numbers shown for a 1°C
increase – a 2.3 per cent increase (Tol 2002) and a 0.4 per cent fall in GWP
(Rehdanz and Maddison 2005) for a 1°C rise – were published in papers
written before 1°C warming had occurred. So how did economists generate
these numbers? The answer is shockingly simple: they made them up.
They used two main methods to generate pseudo-data on global warming’s
effect on the economy. Firstly, they acted as if climate change was merely a
change in the weather, so that anything done indoors or underground would

be ‘negligibly affected by climate change’ (Nordhaus 1991c, p. 930). The
IPCC spouted the same assumption two decades later:
FAQ 10.3 | Are other economic sectors vulnerable to climate change
too?
Economic activities such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and mining are
exposed to the weather and thus vulnerable to climate change. Other
economic activities, such as manufacturing and services, largely take place
in controlled environments and are not really exposed to climate change.
(Arent et al. 2014, p. 688, emphasis added)
They then added up damages expected from temperature increases for
industries that necessarily occur outdoors – farming, forestry, construction,
and so on – and called these ‘enumerated’ damages. They assumed damages
to the rest of the economy would be zero (see table 4.1). In other words,
Nordhaus assumed that anything done under a roof would be unaffected by
climate change, so that a mere 13 per cent of the economy would be
affected by it. The same assumption has been made by all other
Neoclassical economists working on climate change.

activity by vulnerability to climatic change in 1991 US$ terms (Nordhaus
1991c, Table 5, p. 931)

Secondly, they acted as if existing data on the relatively weak relationship
between temperature today and income today could be used ‘as an analogue

for climate change’ (Maddison and Rehdanz 2011, p. 2438). To quote
Richard Tol, who was one of two lead co-authors of the Economics chapter
of the IPCC Report in 2014, this approach:
is based on direct estimates of the welfare impacts, using observed
variations (across space within a single country) in prices and expenditures
to discern the effect of climate. Mendelsohn assumes that the observed
variation of economic activity with climate over space holds over time as
well; and uses climate models to estimate the future effect of climate
change. (Tol 2009, p. 32, emphasis added)
These economists measured the statistical relationship between temperature
and income today, and used parameters derived from that relationship to
estimate the damages from global warming. Since climate today is a
relatively unimportant factor in income today – in that areas with vastly
different temperatures today can have very similar incomes – this portrays
increasing global temperatures as a relatively trivial phenomenon, in stark
contrast to the guidance of scientists noted above.
If the absurdity of these two methods isn’t immediately obvious to you,
contrast these assumptions to the predictions of scientists about the impact
of global warming on the frequency of deadly combinations of heat and
humidity.
According to Mora and colleagues, a 5.5°C increase in global temperatures
would mean that ‘mid-latitudes (for example, 40° N or S) will be exposed
to 60 deadly days per year’ (Mora et al. 2017, p. 504). Even if factories and
shops were not burnt down or flooded in these regions, you would be
unlikely to be able to find workers to work in them, because anyone
sensible would have left these uninhabitable regions of the planet – which
are home to 74 per cent of humans today.
The second assumption means that, if two places today are similar, except
for their average temperature, then the economic future of the colder place
(say, Maryland) under global warming can be estimated by comparing it
with the economy of a warmer place today (say, Florida). Richard Tol made
precisely this claim in a discussion on Twitter in June 2019:

Tol: 10K

is less than the temperature distance between Alaska and
Maryland (about equally rich), or between Iowa and Florida (about equally
rich). Climate is not a primary driver of income.
Daniel Swain: A global climate 10 degrees warmer than present is not
remotely the same thing as taking the current climate and simply adding 10
degrees everywhere. This is an admittedly widespread misconception, but
arguably quite a dangerous one.
Tol: That’s not the point, Daniel. We observe that people thrive in very
different climates, and that some thrive and others do not in the same
climate. Climate determinism therefore has no empirical support.
And if a relationship does not hold for climate variations over space, you
cannot confidently assert that it holds over time.
Maryland’s average temperature between 1971 and 2000 was 12.3°C, and
Florida’s was 21.5°C – so there is roughly a 10°C difference between them
today. Maryland’s per capita income in 2000 was about $33,000, and
Florida’s was $26,000, so Maryland’s income was about 20 per cent higher
than Florida’s. Therefore, ‘making use of spatial variations in the existing
climate as an analogue for climate change’ (Maddison and Rehdanz 2011, p.
2438) implies that 10°C of global warming would reduce Maryland’s
average income by about 20 per cent.
This is absurd. According to scientists, even a 5.5°C increase in global
temperature would render Maryland uninhabitable. At that temperature
level, New York – which is about 250 kilometres north of Maryland –
would experience 55 days of deadly heat and humidity per year. The impact
of another 4°C or more of warming, as in this example, is simply
unthinkable. You simply cannot use comparative temperature and income
data today as a proxy for climate change. If you drive from Maryland to
Florida today, the ambient temperature will rise by about 10°C, but there
will be no change in the global climate: the Arctic will be covered in ice
when you leave Maryland, and it will still be covered in ice when you arrive
in Miami. But if global temperatures rise by even 5.5°C, then according to
scientists (Mora et al. 2017; Steffen et al. 2018), the Arctic will go from
being covered in ice today, to having an average temperature of more than
22°C, and Greenland and Antarctica will be rapidly heading towards being
ice-free. The parts of Maryland that were still above sea level in such a

world would be an inhospitable desert, and any humans foolish enough to
have remained there would have died of heat stroke.
If these two assumptions by economists were defensible, then so too would
be their predictions that climate change will be, to quote one of the
economist-respondents to Nordhaus’s survey in 1994, ‘small potatoes’
(Nordhaus 1994, p. 48). But if they are false – which they manifestly are –
then predictions like Nordhaus’s of ‘damage of 2.0 percent of income at
3°C, and 7.9 percent of global income at a global temperature rise of 6°C’
(Nordhaus 2018b, p. 345) will be wildly wrong. We will find ourselves in a
climate that will cause catastrophic damages to our economic and social
systems. Climate change will make the devastation wrought by Covid-19
look like a picnic.
With global warming to date having pushed global average temperatures to
1.3°C above the average for 1900–20,
## 12
we are fast approaching the point
where reality will let us discern who is right: Neoclassical economists, or
climate scientists, whom Nordhaus himself noted expected damages ‘20 to
30 times higher than mainstream economists’ (Nordhaus 1994, p. 49). I
have no doubt that the scientists will prove far closer to the mark than the
economists.
Neoclassical climate change economics will therefore prove to be an even
worse predictor of the near future of the climate than the Neoclassical
macroeconomics was of the near future of the macroeconomy in 2007. But,
unlike their failure to see the GFC coming, this will not be an error that is
relatively easily attenuated by sensible (non-Neoclassical!) economic
policy. Civilization will instead be in a fight for its survival.
Economists may well escape scrutiny on this greatest of failures, simply
because reacting to the consequences of climate change may leave us with
no time to bring to account those who fooled us – and themselves – into not
taking the threat seriously enough. There are also many other parties who
can be accused of trivializing the dangers of climate change, from fossil
fuel corporations to professional ‘climate change sceptics’ like Bjorn
Lomborg (Lomborg 2020). Maybe economists will escape attention in the
melee.
But if these economists are called to task for their appallingly bad work
(Keen 2020a), one issue will be to what extent their failure was due to their

own personal foibles, and to what extent it was due to the nature of
mainstream economics itself.
The blame for Nordhaus’s blatant misrepresentation of the scientific
literature on tipping elements in the climate is something that can be laid
only at Nordhaus’s feet: nothing in Neoclassical economics forced him to so
utterly misrepresent Lenton’s findings (Lenton et al. 2008).
But the fact that referees for economics journals recommended publication
of papers which assumed that 87 per cent of industry would be unaffected
by climate change because it happens in ‘carefully controlled environments’
(Nordhaus 1991c, p. 930), and which treated the geographic relationship
between temperature and income as a proxy for the relationship between
global warming and income (Mendelsohn et al. 2000), points to a deep
pathology in economics itself that I call ‘the Neoclassical disease’. This is
the practice of treating assumptions whose truth is critical to the relevance
of the theory as mere ‘simplifying assumptions’, and not subjecting them to
serious scrutiny.

## Notes
1   The Cobb–Douglas production function is Y=A×K
α
## ×L
## 1–α
, where Y
represents real output per year (in fictional units of a standard
commodity, often called ‘widgets’), A represents the state of
technology at a point in time (and is called ‘total factor
productivity’ in the Neoclassical literature), K is the ‘number’ of
machines and L the number of workers, and α is a number between
0 and 1 that represents the contribution of capital to production
(generally is set at 0.25–0.3). The Leontief production function is
, where u is a number between 0 and 1 representing the
fraction of the capital stock in use, v is the ‘capital to output ratio’,
which is a measured parameter lying between 2 and 4 for most
countries – and a is the output to labour ratio. Both can be
combined using what is called a CES (‘constant elasticity of
substitution’) function, but in general Neoclassicals use the Cobb–
Douglas form and Post Keynesians use the Leontief.
2   The logic behind these laws is difficult, even for experts, but they
were well summarized in a joke by the poet Alan Ginsberg: ‘1. You
can’t win; 2. You can’t break even; 3. You can’t even get out of the
game’. Ginsberg’s first point captures the First Law of
Thermodynamics, which is that energy can neither be created nor
destroyed: we can’t ‘make’ energy, we can only use what exists.
The second expresses the Second Law, which is the hardest to
characterize without mathematics: for economic analysis, we can
paraphrase it as ‘using energy to do work generates waste’.
Ginsberg’s third quip encapsulates the Third Law, that the only way
to avoid waste energy from work is to find a location where the
temperature is absolute zero (−273.15°C, or −459.67°F) – and there
is no such place.
3   The causation clearly goes both ways – the quadrupling of oil prices
in 1973 and again in 1979 played a large role in the recessions
during those years, while the GFC caused a large drop in energy
consumption in 2006–10.

4  Modelling with Minsky, the free online companion to this book,
includes preliminary models based on production using energy, and
production using energy and matter, using this insight.
5   The functional form of both models is revised from
Y(t)=F(L(t),K(t)) to Q(t)=F(L(E(t)),K(E(t))), where Q(t) represents
output in terms of useful work, while L(E(t)) and K(E(t)) represent
the energy harnessed by labour and capital, respectively, to perform
useful work. Both are expanded to represent the number of
machines (K) and workers (L), multiplied by the energy
consumption per unit per year (E
## L
and E
## K
), times how efficiently
this energy is turned into useful work (e
## L
and e
## K
## ). Thus
L(E(t))=L×E
## L
## ×e
## L
and K(E(t))=K×E
## K
## ×e
## K
. The product E
## L
## ×e
## L
is
treated as a constant C
## L
, since while the energy consumption per
person has risen radically since industrialization began in the late
1700s, the energy output that a typical worker can sustain in
employment has not changed – while the energy consumption and
output of a typical machine has risen radically. With these
alterations, the Cobb–Douglas function becomes
## Q=C
## L
## ∙(E
## K
## ∙e
## K
## )
α
## ∙K
α
## ∙L
## 1–α
, and the Leontief function becomes
Q=u∙K∙E
## K
## ∙e
## K
. The Cobb–Douglas form shows that what
Neoclassical economists call ‘total factor productivity’ is actually
the energy consumption of the ‘representative machine’ at a given
time. The Leontief form implies that the ‘capital to output ratio’ (v)
in the standard Leontief function is actually the inverse of e
## K
## . In
this sense, the Leontief function has implicitly incorporated the role
of energy in production.
6   The atmospheric physicist Tim Garrett has derived a model of
human civilization as a heat engine, exploiting the high potential
energy of fossil fuel reserves to enable civilization to exist at a
higher level of potential energy than the ecology in which it is
embedded. From this he derives a relationship between GDP and
change in energy usage, where his empirical fit is even stronger
than the one that I show in figure 4.2 between change in energy and

change in GDP. We are working together to see if we can make our
two approaches compatible.
7  If you dispute that this is inevitable, with thoughts of the ‘digital
economy’ or ‘decoupling’, take another look at figure 4.2, which
shows the correlation of change in energy with change in GDP for
the last half century. It is 0.83. There would have to be a huge
change in the energy to GDP relationship for decoupling to happen,
and I’m going to call that assumption a fantasy, rather than a
scientific conjecture.
8   This is even without considering the addition of greenhouse gases
to the atmosphere, which is the basis of global warming.
9   The less than 1.5°C increase we have already caused may well be
the ultimate cause of the volatile weather that struck the United
States in February 2021, when all of Texas experienced
temperatures below 0°C: see

from absolute zero, and 1K is equal to 1°C.

The Neoclassical disease
I was presenting my model of Minsky’s ‘Financial Instability Hypothesis’ at
the Western Economic Association conference in 2011 – which took
‘Western’ to extremes by being held in Brisbane, Australia – when a young
American member of the audience became visibly agitated. I had earlier
attended his session, where he had enthusiastically presented his own
‘rational expectations’ macroeconomic model. An essential component of
the Neoclassical definition of ‘rational expectations’ is that ‘rational’ people
have a model of the economy – a Neoclassical one, of course! – which
enables them to accurately predict the future, and which also renders
government policy ineffective:
expectations, since they are informed predictions of future events, are
essentially the same as the predictions of the relevant economic theory.
(Muth 1961, p. 316) ... by virtue of the assumption that expectations are
rational, there is no feedback rule that the authority can employ and expect
to be able systematically to fool the public. (Sargent and Wallace 1976, p.
## 182)
This is not how the dictionary defines ‘rational’: it’s closer to the dictionary
definition of ‘prophetic’. Anyone who accepts the Neoclassical definition of
‘rational’ has, to some significant degree, lost touch with reality. So, I was
expecting an ‘irrational’ reaction from this young zealot to my talk.
And Bingo! Unable to restrain himself, he blurted out ‘But, but you’re
assuming people are idiots!’ in the middle of my talk. I then asked him
‘well, did you predict the Great Recession?’, to which he replied, rather
querulously, ‘Um, no’. I then said ‘So by your own definition, you’re an
idiot. Why shouldn’t I model the world as being made up of people like
you?’
He tried to engage me in further debate after the session, and shouted ‘But
we have to make some simplifying assumptions!’ at me as I left the seminar
room. My riposte, cast over my receding shoulder, was ‘Mate, you have to
learn the difference between a simplifying assumption and a fantasy’.

That, in essence, is the Neoclassical disease: treating something that any
outside observer would regard as a fantasy as a ‘simplifying assumption’,
and asserting that the fantasy cannot be questioned when one challenges the
resulting model. Economics abounds in such fantastical assumptions
because of the problem outlined in the first chapter: economics has, time
and time again, been subject to paradigm-challenging anomalies, but rather
than accepting the challenge, economists have responded by making
ridiculous assumptions to shield the paradigm from criticism.
There are an abundance of examples, but the most apposite here is the
Neoclassical reaction to empirical research in the 1940s by Richard Lester
(Lester 1946) into the actual cost structure of firms. This study had many
precursors (Garver et al. 1938; Hall and Hitch 1939; Means 1935, 1936;
Tucker 1937, 1938), all of which discovered the same phenomenon:
whereas economic theory assumed marginal costs (the additional costs
incurred to produce the last unit of output) rose as output rose, empirical
research found that actual firms had constant or falling marginal costs, right
out to full capacity output. This made researchers like Lester very impatient
with the textbook model of firms:
The conventional explanation of the output and employment policies of
individual firms runs in terms of maximizing profits by equating marginal
revenue and marginal cost. Student protests that their entrepreneurial
parents claim not to operate on the marginal principle have apparently
failed to shake the confidence of the textbook writers in the validity of the
marginal analysis. (Lester 1946, p. 63)
The finding that actual firms have constant or falling marginal costs is a
critical challenge to the Neoclassical theory of the firm because, if so, then
there is no ‘supply curve’. As Mankiw’s textbook states emphatically, ‘The
competitive firm’s short-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost
curve that lies above average variable cost’ (Mankiw 2001, p. 298) and
‘The competitive firm’s long-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal
cost curve that lies above average total cost’ (Mankiw 2001, p. 301).
If marginal cost – the cost of producing the last unit made – is constant or
falling, then there is no ‘portion of its marginal-cost curve that lies above
average variable cost’: marginal cost is either equal to average variable cost
(if marginal cost is constant) or below it (if it is falling). A constant or

falling marginal cost curve will also always be lower than average total
costs (the sum of fixed and variable costs, divided by the number of units
produced), so that any firm that set price equal to marginal cost – a
fundamental condition in the Neoclassical model of ‘perfect competition’ –
would lose money. Since most firms have constant or falling marginal cost,
as empirical studies before and after Lester (Blinder 1998; Downward
1994; Eiteman 1947; Eiteman and Guthrie 1952; Hall 1988; Means 1972)
have confirmed, then the Neoclassical theory of price being set by the
intersection of supply and demand schedules can’t possibly be correct.
From a realist perspective, this is hardly amazing. The Neoclassical model
of production is simply an anagram of its model of consumer behaviour,
where consumers gain utility by consuming a range of commodities that are
easily substituted for each other. Each new unit of a commodity consumed
adds to total utility, but at a declining rate – hence the concept of
‘diminishing marginal utility’. Similarly, the model of production has a
factory that can take a range of easily substitutable inputs and convert them
into outputs, but these variable inputs are applied to a constant amount of
fixed capital – a bit like food into the consumer’s belly, where the quantity
and composition of inputs are highly variable, while the stomach is a fixed
size (at least in the ‘short run’). Each input has positive ‘marginal
productivity’ – each new unit of input adds to total output – but at a falling
rate, hence ‘diminishing marginal productivity’. This in turn causes rising
marginal cost: each additional unit of a variable input costs the same
amount to buy, but produces less output, so marginal cost rises.
In the real world, factories are nothing like a consumer’s stomach. They are
instead designed by engineers to achieve maximum efficiency at full
capacity, but they also necessarily start with unused capacity – otherwise
the factory would be too small to accommodate growth in demand over
time. As demand grows, new machines are added (or machinery which was
idle is turned on) and paired with new variable inputs (labour and raw
materials) so that per-machine productivity remains constant, while the
overall efficiency of the factory rises as it approaches full capacity.
Consequently, so long as it can price its output above its average cost of
production, the more units sold, the more profit is made, and the ideal
output level is 100 per cent of capacity (long before this point is reached,
the firm should be building a new factory with even lower costs). This is

what Sraffa hypothesized on logical grounds in 1926 (Sraffa 1926), and
what Lester reported in his 1946 survey:
Individual-firm studies ... indicate that average variable costs (and marginal
costs) tend to be constant per unit of product over the usual range of output,
which includes up to practically full capacity ... In reply to the question,
‘At what level of operations are your profits generally greatest under
peacetime conditions?’ 42 firms answered 100 per cent of plant capacity.
The remaining 11 replies ranged from 75 to 95 per cent of capacity. (Lester
1946, pp. 67–8)
A realism-oriented discipline would have taken this empirical contradiction
of its original model to heart, and come up with a new model of how prices
are set which is compatible with constant or falling marginal costs – such as
Kalecki’s ‘degree of monopoly’ markup-pricing model, for example
(Kalecki 1942; Kriesler 1988). But instead, the main economic response to
this paper was Milton Friedman’s infamous ‘assumptions don’t matter’
methodology paper (Friedman 1953), in which Friedman advised
economists to not even bother to read Lester’s research:
The lengthy discussion on marginal analysis in the American Economic
Review some years ago is an even clearer, though much less important,
example. The articles on both sides of the controversy largely neglect what
seems to me clearly the main issue – the conformity to experience of the
implications of the marginal analysis – and concentrate on the largely
irrelevant question whether businessmen do or do not in fact reach their
decisions by consulting schedules, or curves, or multivariable functions
showing marginal cost and marginal revenue. (Friedman 1953, p. 15)
In place of accepting that empirical data contradicted Neoclassical theory,
Friedman recommended an ‘as if’ approach: even though we know firms
don’t behave as our model suggests, let’s model them ‘as if’ they do:

It is only a short step from these examples to the economic hypothesis that
under a wide range of circumstances individual firms behave as if they were
seeking rationally to maximize their expected returns ... and had full
knowledge of the data needed to succeed in this attempt; as if, that is, they
knew the relevant cost and demand functions, calculated marginal cost and
marginal revenue from all actions open to them, and pushed each line of
action to the point at which the relevant marginal cost and marginal revenue
were equal. (Friedman 2007, p. 158)
However, Lester’s research was not about whether or not businesses
actually used calculus to determine the profit-maximizing level of output,
but whether the conditions needed for that method to work in the first place
actually applied in the real world. He, like every researcher on this topic
before and after him, found that they did not. ‘Diminishing marginal
productivity’ did not apply to actual production processes, marginal cost
was either constant or fell as output increased, and average costs fell all the
way out to capacity. Hence, so long as price exceeded average cost, the
sensible strategy was to sell as many units as possible. But Neoclassical
economists didn’t want to hear this message, and Friedman’s ‘as if’
methodology let them ignore it – as they have done ever since (Blinder
## 1998).
## 1
As well as successfully suppressing the attention paid to empirical research
into firms, Friedman also provided a convenient argument that economists
could use against any criticism of any of their models on the grounds of that
their assumptions were unrealistic. In what became known as the ‘F-twist’,
Friedman argued that unrealistic assumptions were indicative of a good
theory, rather than a bad one:

the relation between the significance of a theory and the ‘realism’ of its
‘assumptions’ is almost the opposite of that suggested by the view under
criticism. Truly important and significant hypotheses will be found to have
‘assumptions’ that are wildly inaccurate descriptive representations of
reality, and, in general, the more significant the theory, the more unrealistic
the assumptions (in this sense) ...
To put this point less paradoxically, the relevant question to ask about the
‘assumptions’ of a theory is not whether they are descriptively ‘realistic,’
for they never are, but whether they are sufficiently good approximations
for the purpose in hand. And this question can be answered only by seeing
whether the theory works, which means whether it yields sufficiently
accurate predictions. The two supposedly independent tests thus reduce to
one test. (Friedman 2007, p. 153, emphasis added)
This is spin disguised as methodology. For a start, as philosopher Alan
Musgrave pointed out brilliantly (Musgrave 1981), Friedman’s ‘the more
significant the theory, the more unrealistic the assumptions’ argument is
only even passably true of the simplest class of assumption, which
Musgrave labels, for obvious reasons, ‘simplifying assumptions’. This is the
decision to leave out some obvious aspect of reality, in the context of an
experiment where you expect that aspect to play a minor role. Air resistance
when heavy objects are dropped from a building is a good example. When
Galileo experimentally contradicted the belief of the prevailing Aristotelian
paradigm that heavy objects fell faster than light objects, he effectively
ignored the impact of air resistance. If he had taken it into account, he
would have had to construct a vastly more complicated apparatus, but the
effect on the experiment would have been slight, and the results would still
have contradicted the Aristotelian paradigm.
However, Friedman’s argument is utterly false when it is applied to another
class of assumptions, which Musgrave labels ‘domain assumptions’. These
are assumptions that delineate the boundaries within which the theory to be
tested actually applies. If the assumption holds, then so will the theory. If
the assumption is false, then so will be the theory. In the case of domain
assumptions therefore, it is vitally necessary to know whether they hold or
not: you can’t simply take such an assumption for granted.

For examples of domain assumptions, you need look no further than the
assumptions that Neoclassical economists make all the damn time that are
manifestly false, but which if they were true, then the resulting theory
would also be true. From the cornucopia of riches of such assumptions,
possibly the most absurd of all relate to the mental gymnastics Neoclassical
economists have undertaken to avoid the implications of the
‘Sonnenschein–Mantel–Debreu’ theorem (as discussed in chapter 3).
Gorman’s assumption, reproduced on page 96 and below, is bad enough.
But it pales into insignificance in comparison to the one Samuelson used to
justify this confident statement in his undergraduate textbook (written
jointly with William Nordhaus):
The market demand curve is found by adding together the quantities
demanded by all individuals at each price. Does the market demand curve
obey the law of downward-sloping demand? It certainly does. (Samuelson
and Nordhaus 2010b, p. 48, emphasis added)
I knew that this statement was false when I first read it. The only mystery to
me was whether Samuelson and Nordhaus were simply bullshitting – yes I
know this is an academic book, but what else can you call what
Neoclassical economists routinely do? – or whether they thought they had
proven otherwise. It turned out to be the latter. In a paper entitled ‘Social
Indifference Curves’ (Samuelson 1956), Samuelson confronted the same
dilemma that Gorman considered three years earlier. Neoclassical theory
easily derives the ‘Law of Demand’ for one individual: the statement that if
a good gets more expensive, a given consumer will buy less of it. Make
apples more expensive relative to oranges, and the consumer will buy fewer
apples.
But that proof for the individual assumes that changing prices does not
change the individual’s income. You can’t assume that when you attempt to
construct a market demand curve for a specific economy. While one
individual’s income might not be altered when you make apples relatively
more expensive than oranges, when you consider the entire economy – as
you must to construct a market demand curve – then you are going to make
apple producers wealthier and orange producers poorer. If they also have
different tastes, then the change in income distribution caused by the change
in relative prices will affect demand in turn, and in possibly perverse ways.
For example, apple producers might regard vodka and apple juice as a

luxury, while orange producers might prefer Tequila Sunrises. Then quite
possibly, making apples more expensive might increase the demand for
apples, because the now-wealthier apple producers (and producers of other
goods whose incomes also rise) buy more apples.
The only way to avoid this outcome is a patently absurd assumption, which
Samuelson properly points out is an ‘impossibility theorem’:
The common sense of this impossibility theorem is easy to grasp.
Allocating the same totals differently among people must generally change
the resulting equilibrium price ratio. The only exception is where tastes are
identical, not only for all men, but also for all men when they are rich or
poor. (Samuelson 1956, p. 5)
So far, so good: Samuelson is describing as absurd the assumption that
Gorman described as ‘intuitively reasonable’ three years earlier, that ‘an
extra unit of purchasing power should be spent in the same way no matter
to whom it is given’ (Gorman 1953, p. 64). But then, he imagines that a
‘family indifference curve’ can be constructed, because:
since blood is thicker than water, the preferences of the different members
are interrelated by what might be called a ‘consensus’ or ‘social welfare
function’ which takes into account the deservingness or ethical worths of
the consumption levels of each of the members. The family acts as if it were
maximizing their [sic] joint welfare function. (Samuelson 1956, p. 10)
Notice the ‘as if’ in the final sentence: ‘The family acts as if it were
maximizing their joint welfare function’. So, the typical American family is
one big, happy unit, which pools all family income and then shares it out so
that everyone is OK with the distribution of income, before any shopping
takes place? Not from what I can see in both fact and fiction on
conventional and social media! But OK, Samuelson has moved from
individuals to families with only a moderately outrageous assumption, of
using a harmonious family as his model rather than a fractious one.
But then came the coup de grâce: how do we get from a harmonious family
to the whole of society? Simple! We assume that all of society operates like
one big, happy family:

The same argument will apply to all of society if optimal reallocations of
income can be assumed to keep the ethical worth of each person’s marginal
dollar equal. (Samuelson 1956, p. 21, emphasis added)
Oh please! The United States of America, home to a libertarian philosophy
exalting ‘freedom’ above all else, championing the absence of centralized
control, divided by politics, class and race, with by far the highest murder
and incarceration rates in the developed world, has sitting over it some
political process – a benevolent central authority perhaps – that reallocates
income so that everybody is happy about its distribution, before any buying
and selling takes place?
Before you think I’m merely being sarcastic here, this is how the leading
PhD-level Neoclassical textbook Microeconomics (Mas-Colell et al. 1995)
puts Samuelson’s assumption approvingly:
Let us now hypothesize that there is a process, a benevolent central
authority perhaps, that, for any given prices p and aggregate wealth
function w, redistributes wealth in order to maximize social welfare. (Mas-
Colell et al. 1995, p. 117, emphasis added)
To me, the fact that Neoclassical economists are willing to accept a
‘hypothesis’ like this to maintain their paradigm is the strongest possible
sign that it has failed, and is only kept alive by what John Quiggin
characterized as zombie thinking (Quiggin 2010). Here is the dominant,
mainstream model of ‘free market’ capitalism, willingly assuming the
existence of a ‘benevolent central authority’ as an integral part of a ‘free
market’.
The madness of this assumption aside, if there was a planet on which such a
‘free market’ was overseen by such a ‘benevolent central authority’, it
would be possible to explain downward-sloping market demand curves
using Neoclassical economic theory. But are we on that planet? No: on this
one, Americans can’t even agree on the tallying of votes in an election.
Therefore, because the assumption is false, so is the theory. It is a domain
assumption, not a simplifying assumption.
But Samuelson’s paper was approved for publication by referees. The same
is done, time and time again, when the choice is between realism and
preserving Neoclassical economic beliefs: reality loses out. Friedman’s

paper simply codified a common practice in economics: using patently false
domain assumptions to paper over profound logical problems in the
underlying theory.
In the context of this ingrained dishonesty in how Neoclassical economics
has developed, an assumption like Nordhaus’s that, of America’s total GDP,
87 per cent is created ‘in sectors that are negligibly affected by climate
change’ (Nordhaus 1991c, p. 930), is water off a duck’s back for referees
who already accept such things as ‘perfect foresight’ as a legitimate
assumption in an economic model (Debreu 1959).
## 2
So rather than being
rejected by referees, the insane proposition that a roof will protect you from
climate change is treated as a ‘simplifying assumption’, and accepted.
Equally probably, they are, like Nordhaus himself, innately climate change
trivializers: ‘Climate change is likely to produce a combination of gains and
losses with no strong presumption of substantial net economic damages’
(Nordhaus 1991c, p. 933); ‘I am known to the respondents as one who has
developed estimates of the impact of climatic change that are modest
compared with some of the scientific concerns and popular rhetoric’
(Nordhaus 1994, p. 46). They could actually agree with Nordhaus’s false
assumption, and let it pass for that reason. As with the Global Financial
Crisis in 2007, mainstream economists will be amongst those who will be
most surprised by the coming ecological crisis.
The only remaining defence of Friedman’s ‘don’t judge a theory by its
assumptions’ methodology is that doing so is a subjective judgement,
relying on the opinions of referees, whereas Friedman’s test of waiting to
see whether the theory ‘yields sufficiently accurate predictions’ (Friedman
2007, p. 153) is objective, relying on the results of the experiment in the
real world. In effect, this argues in favour of a weak publication standard, of
admitting almost any assumption, and letting reality decide whether the
theory is a good description of reality instead.
However, as the vignette at the start of this chapter illustrates, this tolerant
treatment of assumptions by Neoclassicals is applied only to assumptions
that fit into, or preserve, the Neoclassical paradigm. When you make
assumptions that are incompatible with Neoclassical economics, your
papers are rejected out of hand because of its assumptions – and often by
editors using Neoclassical assumptions to justify doing so (Keen 2013a).
## 3

Critically in the case of the economics of climate change, this free pass for
bad methodology is only justifiable if the issue being considered has no
significant and irreversible ramifications. If you have a crazy theory about
consumer behaviour, and you test it in an experiment and it fails, then the
only victims are the experimental subjects, and the theory improves as the
results of the failure are incorporated into it.
But if your theory is about the impact of climate change on the future of
human civilization? Then if your assumption is false, the consequences for
human civilization are catastrophic and irreversible. There is no ‘Planet B’.
Treating assumptions this way in the context of climate change ‘amounts to
conducting a one-time, irreversible experiment of unknown outcome with
the habitability of the entire planet’ (DeCanio 2003, p. 3). We simply cannot
afford the consequences of these assumptions being wrong – as they
manifestly are.
However, because Friedman’s methodology is widely accepted by
Neoclassical economists, and taught in economics textbooks (Mankiw
2012, pp. 22–4), Neoclassical referees let Nordhaus’s crazy assumption
pass.
Then the mechanics of the refereeing process took over, and amplified the
problem. Given the tiny number of papers published in economics journals
on climate change – Nicholas Stern observed that ‘the Quarterly Journal of
Economics, which is currently the most-cited journal in the field of
economics, has never published an article on climate change’, while the top
nine general economics journals have published just fifty-seven papers, out
of a total of over 77,000 (Oswald and Stern 2019) – Nordhaus would
already have been a ‘go to’ referee on climate change papers for editors of
economics journals, after the publication of ‘Measurement without Data’ –
his attack on the precursor to the Limits to Growth model in 1973
(Nordhaus 1973) – and his subsequent papers on energy and climate issues
(National Research Council 1978; Nordhaus et al. 1973, 1974a, 1974b,
1976, 1977, 1980a, 1980b, 1982, 1986, 1991a, 1991b). This would have
enabled him to enforce a degree of conformity in papers on the economics
of climate change, which would then have resulted in more referees who
concurred with Nordhaus’s position, further enforcing a trivializing
hegemony on academic publications on the economics of climate change.

Richard Tol himself observed that the researchers in this field are tightly
connected: ‘Nordhaus and Mendelsohn are colleagues and collaborators at
Yale University; at University College of London, Fankhauser, Maddison,
and I all worked with David Pearce and one another, while Rehdanz was a
student of Maddison and mine’ (Tol 2009, p. 31). A refereeing process
calling upon such a limited pool of researchers as referees could, as even
Tol deduced, lead to groupthink:
it is quite possible that the estimates are not independent, as there are only a
relatively small number of studies, based on similar data, by authors who
know each other well ... although the number of researchers who published
marginal damage cost estimates is larger than the number of researchers
who published total impact estimates, it is still a reasonably small and
close-knit community who may be subject to group-think, peer pressure,
and self-censoring. (Tol 2009, pp. 37, 42–3)
The refereeing process in economics journals thus enforces the hegemony
of Neoclassical economics in general, while in climate change, it has
entrenched a denialist perspective for almost fifty years – ever since
William Nordhaus destroyed the credibility of a rival methodology to
Neoclassical economics known as ‘system dynamics’. It is more than a little
ironic that, given the cavalier attitude that Nordhaus has since displayed
towards data on climate change, his attack focused on Forrester’s treatment
of data (Nordhaus 1973).
Nordhaus’s successful – and manifestly fallacious (Forrester et al. 1974) –
dismissal of system dynamics in ‘Measurement without Data’ has had
disastrous consequences. First and foremost, he replaced the prescient
warnings of the original Limits to Growth study (Meadows et al. 1972;
Turner 2008, 2014) with his own Panglossian belief in the capacity for
effectively unlimited growth on a finite planet. Had policymakers taken
Limits to Growth seriously, we might well have begun the gradual
implementation of the policies they recommended to avoid a calamitous
future. Instead, meaningful action on climate change was delayed by half a
century, over which time humanity’s pressure on the biosphere has more
than trebled. Significant, highly damaging climate change is now a
certainty, and the actions needed to address it will be far more drastic than
the methods which could have been employed fifty years ago.

Secondly, system dynamics was in fact the solution that Jevons, one of the
founding fathers of Neoclassical economics, longed for eighty years earlier:
a method by which the manifestly inadequate reliance upon equilibrium
modelling could be replaced by dynamics ‘in all its natural complexity’:
We must carefully distinguish, at the same time, between the Statics and
Dynamics of this subject. The real condition of industry is one of perpetual
motion and change. Commodities are being continually manufactured and
exchanged and consumed. If we wished to have a complete solution of the
problem in all its natural complexity, we should have to treat it as a
problem of motion – a problem of dynamics. But it would surely be absurd
to attempt the more difficult question when the more easy one is yet so
imperfectly within our power. It is only as a purely statical problem that I
can venture to treat the action of exchange. (Jevons 1888, p. 93, emphasis
added)
This crucial methodological error by economists must be reversed. System
dynamics can and should be the methodological core of a new economics,
which will have to be built by students of economics over the objections –
and behind the backs – of their Neoclassical instructors.

## Notes
1   The most telling example here is Alan Blinder’s book Asking about
Prices. Blinder is a key member of the economic mainstream, and
yet his book has been utterly ignored. In contrast to over a hundred
reviews on Amazon for Mas-Colell’s Microeconomics textbook,
there is just one review of Blinder’s empirically grounded book –
and I wrote it. Neoclassical economists blissfully ignore
inconvenient truths. Ironically, this even includes Blinder, who does
not cite his own research in his microeconomics textbook.
2  My favourite instance of such an assumption occurs in the hallowed
Theory of Value, by Nobel Prize recipient Gerard Debreu. For
decades the Arrow–Debreu framework was the ‘gold standard’ of
economic reasoning. Here is how Debreu handles the future: ‘For a
producer ... a production plan (made now for the whole future) is a
specification of the quantities of all his inputs and all his outputs ...
The certainty assumption implies that he knows now what input-
output combinations will be possible in the future (although he may
not know now the details of the technical processes which will make
them possible)’ (Debreu 1959, pp. 37–8). His extension to an
uncertain future results in ‘a theory of uncertainty free from any
probability concept and formally identical with the theory of
certainty developed in the preceding chapters’ (Debreu 1959, p. 98).
3  My paper ‘A Monetary Minsky Model of the Great Moderation and
the Great Recession’ was rejected, without refereeing, by the editor
of the American Economic Review: Macro, because I did not
assume rational expectations. In a heated email exchange after that
rejection, the editor at one point stated, without irony, ‘but what if
they get more information about the future? How will that change
things?’. Information, about the future. Yeah, right...

Conclusion: Be the change
Looking back on the fifty years since I first became aware of its flaws, the
word that summarizes my feelings about Neoclassical economics today is
that it is, as Marx once described the proto-Neoclassical Jean-Baptiste Say,
‘dull’ (Marx 1857 [1993], footnote pp. 267–8). Its vision of capitalism at its
best is a system manifesting the harmony of equilibrium, where everyone is
paid their just return (their ‘marginal product’), growth is occurring
smoothly at a rate that maximizes social utility through time, and everyone
is motivated by consumption – rather than accumulation and power –
because, to quote Say, ‘the producers, though they have all of them the air
of demanding money for their goods, do in reality demand merchandise for
their merchandise’ (Say 1821, Chapter 18).
What a bland picture of the complex, changing world in which we live!
For all its flaws, capitalism was and remains an exciting social system. For
all his flaws (Keen 1993a, 1993b), Marx put this best, in his own Manifesto.
Though it called for the overthrow of capitalism, The Communist Manifesto
was also a paean to the creative and transformative nature of capitalism and
its distinctive class, whom Marx called ‘the bourgeoisie’, and we might
today call ‘entrepreneurs’. For them, the guiding principle is not
‘merchandise for their merchandise’, said Marx, but ‘Accumulate,
accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets!’ (Marx 1867, Chapter 24). In
contrast to the staid conservatism of the dominant classes of previous social
systems, Marx declared that ‘the bourgeoisie cannot exist without
constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the
relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society’:

Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the
contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes.
Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all
social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the
bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast frozen relations, with
their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept
away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All
that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last
compelled to face with sober senses his real condition of life and his
relations with his kind. (Marx and Engels 1848 [2017], p. 54, emphasis
added)
How did Marx’s exciting portrayal of capitalism lose out to Say’s vapid
vision?
In part, this was deliberate. Nitzan and Bichler point out that the
quintessential nineteenth-century robber-baron John D. Rockefeller
regarded his $45 million endowment to the Baptist University of Chicago,
which would eventually become the intellectual home of Milton Friedman,
as ‘the best investment I ever made’ (Nitzan and Bichler 2009, p. 76). As
De Vroey argued, ‘the new paradigm was especially attractive because it
looked as scientific as the natural sciences theories, while it eluded the
dangerous topics of class interests and transformation of the system ... This
inoffensiveness was and is, from the viewpoint of the capitalist ruling class,
the main quality of the neoclassical paradigm’ (De Vroey 1975, p. 435).
This explains the appeal of Neoclassical economics to establishment
interests, but it doesn’t explain its appeal to Neoclassical economists
themselves. There, I believe, the vision of capitalism as a utopia is what
excites the Neoclassical mind – and this utopia only applies in equilibrium,
whether that be the Partial equilibrium of Marshall, the General equilibrium
of Walras, the Nash equilibrium of game theory, or Ramsey’s (Ramsey
1928) inter-temporal equilibrium that is the foundation of Real Business
Cycle and Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models. This reliance
upon equilibrium as a foundation for the welfare claims of Neoclassical
economics turned the reluctant use of equilibrium techniques by the
founders of Neoclassical economics – as the quote from Jevons in the
previous chapter indicates – into a secular religion.

Looked at dispassionately, this is a religion which has proven that its God
doesn’t exist. Its many failures point in the direction that may, finally, lead
to a passably scientific economics.
Neoclassical economics abolished the concept of social classes, let alone
class conflict, by the mechanism of the marginal productivity theory of
income distribution, and the classless construct of the ‘representative
agent’. But the Cambridge Controversies – where, it must be remembered,
Samuelson conceded defeat (Samuelson 1966) – showed that the return to
capital cannot be its marginal product (Garegnani 1970; Pasinetti 1969),
while the Sonnenschein–Mantel–Debreu theorem (Sonnenschein 1972,
1973a, 1973b) implies, as Alan Kirman put it, that:
demand and expenditure functions if they are to be set against reality must
be defined at some reasonably high level of aggregation. The idea that we
should start at the level of the isolated individual is one which we may well
have to abandon. (Kirman 1989, p. 138)
These results validate the Classical school’s approach of dividing society
into social classes, and of treating profit as a residual, whose scale depends
on the relative power of those social classes. Issues of power and the
distribution of income, which were assumed away by Neoclassical
economics, come back to centre stage.
Similarly, Neoclassical economics could only take the finance sector off the
economic stage by using a manifestly false model of banking. Now that the
reality that banks create money is acknowledged, so too must be the role of
the finance sector in creating asset price bubbles (see figures 2.12 and 2.14)
and financial crises (see figure 3.4), and in enabling the accumulation and
concealment of wealth.
These necessary aspects of a realistic New Economics have a paradoxical
political outcome. They result from having a fearless agnosticism about
ideology and politics: to acknowledge that capitalism is a class system is
simply acknowledging a fact, while the Neoclassical ‘representative agent’
is a fiction. But they also mean that economics is necessarily political. With
a class-based analysis, the consequences for different social classes of
different economic policies must be confronted. The distributions of
income, wealth and power matter, and economists can no longer hide
behind aggregate cost–benefit analysis when debating policy.

The New Economics must also be grounded in the actual dynamics,
complexity and chaos of capitalism. Though there is nothing political about
this – it is simply a case of using the tools of analysis that suit the dynamic,
evolutionary system that capitalism itself is – I expect that this dynamic
foundation will lead to an economics that will be as progressive as the
equilibrium foundation of Neoclassical economics proved to be reactionary.
The preceding chapters have sketched out essential elements of a post-
Neoclassical economic paradigm: the need for a monetary foundation, the
need to understand complexity, the need to be grounded in the biophysics of
production using energy and matter, to be integrated with a proper
understanding of ecology, and above all, the need for realism in its
assumptions and methods, as opposed to the Neoclassical reliance upon
armchair fantasies. The question with which I close this book is: What
should the mathematical foundation of this new paradigm be?
I am fully aware that some of my non-Neoclassical colleagues believe that
we should eschew mathematical modelling completely (Lawson 2013). My
rejoinders in Keen (2015a) were that Lawson’s critique applies to linear
models rather than nonlinear ones, and that mathematics has been abused,
not used, by Neoclassicals. Failing to do mathematical modelling cedes to
the Neoclassicals a vital space for the formation of economic thought,
economic policy and the shaping of society, both in practice, and in
people’s mental image of the economy.
While mathematics has limitations in describing complex social systems,
rather than ceding this tool to Neoclassical economists, we must instead
supplant them. As Nordhaus and colleagues have ably demonstrated,
Neoclassical economists have no qualms about providing the numerical
estimates that politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen crave. Those
numbers, fallacious or not, shape economic policy. The visual form in
which their mathematics is portrayed, the ubiquitous totem of the
intersecting supply and demand curves, is also the mental picture that the
majority of people have of the economy, from the woman on the street to
the politicians in parliament. We cannot afford to abrogate this territory: we
will not displace the Neoclassical totem from people’s minds without our
own mathematical and visual alternatives.

My nomination for the mathematical foundation of a post-Neoclassical
economics is system dynamics, which was invented by the brilliant
engineer Jay Forrester in the mid to late 1950s. Forrester had previously
played a major role in the design of mechanical control systems for naval
radar and gun mounts during the Second World War. After the war, he was a
lead developer of the world’s first aircraft simulator, the first random access
memory system for computers, and even the world’s first computer
animation (Forrester 1995). In 1956, he submitted a paper to his Faculty at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, discussing his conclusions from
a three-month-long study of economics. Entitled ‘Dynamic Models of
Economic Systems and Industrial Organizations’ (Forrester 2003), the note
covered what he perceived as the weaknesses of existing economic models,
and outlined an alternative approach. Sadly, his criticisms of economics are
even more relevant today than when he made them in 1956. They are worth
citing at length here:

One of the striking shortcomings of most economic models is their failure
to reflect adequately the structural form of the regenerative loops that make
up our economic system. The flows of money, materials, and information
feed one another around closed re-entering paths ... The behavior of such
loops (their tendency to amplify or dampen disturbances, their natural
frequency of oscillation, their ability to shift the phase or timing of events
which feed into them) is determined by characteristics which are usually
omitted from the models in the literature. ...
Present models neglect to interrelate adequately the flows of goods, money,
information, and labor ...
Linear equations have usually been used to describe a system whose
essential characteristic, I believe, arise from its non-linearities ...
Models, suitable only for long-range prediction, are often used with short-
term influences and fluctuations omitted. This is justifiable only if the
system is sufficiently linear to permit superposition, an assumption which
has not been justified or defended and which is probably untrue. Therefore,
the long-range trends are probably very much a function of the short-range
behavior of a system ...
Many models are formulated in terms of systems of simultaneous algebraic
equations. These impress me as particularly unsuited to the kind of behavior
being studied ...
The models and their symbolism and notation are often abstracted so far
from physical and social reality that they lull one into overlooking
otherwise evident departures from the world of men, money, and materials
## ...
Preoccupation with the determination of numerical coefficients to two or
three decimal places sometimes overshadows the meaning and significance
of those coefficients, while the very structure of the model may be in doubt
## ...
Very often the model and its results are judged by the logic with which the
model is developed out of its founding assumptions, whereas the failures
probably lie in those assumptions. (Forrester 2003, pp. 331–5)

In addition to providing a devastatingly accurate critique of mainstream
economics, Forrester also sketched out an alternative approach, free of the
limitations of existing economic models (then and now!), by which the
dynamic structure of an economy could be accurately described. He
emphasized structural realism, the explicit treatment of time, and the use of
nonlinear differential, rather than linear algebraic or difference, equations:
The greatest possible detailed attention should be given to the actual
sequences of actions which take place in the system ... consumers do not
purchase (as implied by most past models) from producers of goods. They
buy from retailers, who buy from wholesale distributors, who draw goods
from factory warehouses ... Such a distinction and stress on reality can
have a first-order effect on the degree to which a model matches the real
system in performance ...
Time delays and their causes are of paramount importance ...
When an economic model is built with the proper structure, we may find
that much of the apparent volatility and irrationality now ascribed to human
behavior will disappear ...
Almost every characteristic that one examines in the economic system is
highly non-linear ... In a sufficiently non-linear system we should expect,
until shown otherwise, that the short-term behavior may set the stage for the
longer-term reactions ...
The behavior that we wish to describe in economic systems seems much
better described by non-linear differential equations than by the algebraic
equations and matrix operations which are so often used ...
The incremental time intervals for which the variables of a model are
solved step-by-step in time must be much shorter than often supposed ...
This solution interval is unrelated to the interval at which national statistics
and economic indicators are measured. (Forrester 2003, pp. 337–45)
He provided a stylized drawing of the endogenous cycles generated by the
time delays in an advertising campaign, inspired by consulting work he was
doing at the time for General Electric. This consulting task led to the
development, by his computer programmer colleague Richard Bennett, of
the first ‘system dynamics’ program, called SIMPLE: ‘Simulation of
Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations’ (Forrester 1995),

in 1958. System dynamics was born, and the first flowchart-based programs
(Stella, IThink, Vensim), with a visual approach to building models of real-
world complex systems, were developed soon afterwards.
The fundamental element of a system dynamics model is the integral
equation. This takes a differential equation like, for example, ‘The rate of
change of population equals Births minus Deaths’ and restates it as
‘Population equals the Initial Population plus the Integral of Births minus
Deaths’ (see figure 6.1). The reason for using integration rather than
differentiation is that system dynamics models are simulated numerically,
and numerical integration (calculating the area beneath a curve) is a much
more stable process than numerical differentiation (calculating the slope of
a curve).
Figure 6.1. Simple population growth as an integral equation in Minsky.
See http://www.profstevekeen.com/minsky/
A system dynamics model will have from several to thousands of
interrelated stocks, each of which is a ‘system state’, and the value of one
state will affect that of one or more others via feedback effects. One of the
simplest models is the one we discussed in chapter 3, the ‘predator-prey’
model, which has two system states – the number of predators and the
number of prey – and the value of one affects the rate of change of the
other. A model like World3, which was the basis of Limits to Growth
(Meadows et al. 1972), has dozens of system states, and hundreds of
feedback loops.
Today, system dynamics is commonplace in engineering and management,
but it has never developed a strong following in economics. This is not
despite the fact that it was first developed in response to shortcomings in
economic modelling, but because of it. System dynamics was perceived as a
fundamental challenge to the equilibrium-obsessed methodology of

Neoclassical economics, and its challenge was effectively repulsed. The
attack, in response to the application of this technology to issues of
environmental economics – firstly by Forrester in the book World Dynamics
(Forrester 1971, 1973), and then by Meadows, Meadows and Randers in
Limits to Growth (Meadows et al. 1972) – was led by none other than
William Nordhaus (Nordhaus 1973). You should appreciate the irony, given
how Nordhaus has used obvious fallacies to make up his own numbers on
climate change, that his main critique of Forrester’s work was its poor
attention to data.
Forrester’s rebuttal of Nordhaus was in summary that ‘each point made by
Nordhaus rests on a misunderstanding of World Dynamics, a misuse of
empirical data, or an inability to analyze properly the dynamic behavior of
the model by static equilibrium methods’ (Forrester et al. 1974, p. 169;
Bardi 2018). Forrester was right and Nordhaus was wrong, but the damage
was done. Though Limits to Growth had an enormous impact upon the
public and the environmental movement, and its empirical predictions have
held up well over time (Turner 2008, 2014), the technology itself was
ridiculed out of contention in economics.
Consequently, while system dynamics technology has progressed
enormously in engineering, outside the work of enthusiasts like Andresen,
King, Radzicki, Tauheed and Wheat (Andresen 2018; King 2020; Radzicki
2003; Radzicki and Tauheed 2009; Wheat 2007, 2017) its application in
even non-Neoclassical economics is almost non-existent. The engineering
programs (like Simulink, Mathworks’ extension to Matlab, and System
Modeler, Wolfram’s extension to Mathematica) are extremely powerful
with modern interfaces, and are routinely used by engineers to model new
technology before it is constructed, but they are tailored to the needs of
engineers rather than economists. The management-social-science programs
(like Stella and Vensim) have only a small user base compared to the
engineering community, and their interfaces are very cumbersome and
antiquated compared to modern software. In particular, the fact that
connections between system states are made exclusively using ‘wires’ (like
those shown in figure 6.1), while the equations are buried behind text
boxes, results in ‘spaghetti diagrams’ that can be unintelligible to a non-
professional audience.

Minsky is intended to address the deficiencies of existing programs for
economic modelling, and to overcome their user interface shortcomings as
well.
Minsky allows values to be ‘passed by variable’ as well as ‘passed by wire’
to reduce diagram clutter, equations are immediately visible on the design
canvas (as illustrated by figure 6.1), and most importantly, it adds the
unique feature of ‘Godley Tables’ that make it far easier to model financial
flows. It is still a very ‘young’ program (at the time of writing, less than
$500,000 has been spent on its development), but it is capable of simulating
any deterministic dynamic model at present, and (if we can secure
continued funding) we’ll add more capabilities over time.
## 1
My criticisms of existing software aside, the system dynamics community
is vibrant and growing, with excellent online resources such as those
provided by the System Dynamics Society, including over fifty online
courses. There are a limited number of degree programs in system dynamics
(see https://systemdynamics.org/courses/), but you can also teach yourself
using the resources provided by the community. Donella Meadows’
Thinking in Systems (Meadows 2008) is an excellent overview for the
interested reader and intending practitioner alike. Melanie Mitchell’s
Complexity: A Guided Tour (Mitchell 2009) is a useful companion on the
general issue of complex systems, and Hartmut Bossel’s Modeling and
Simulation (Bossel 1994) is a classic for intending practitioners. The pure
and applied mathematics behind system dynamics is covered
comprehensively and engagingly in Martin Braun’s Differential Equations
and Their Applications (Braun 1993).
Multi-agent-modelling (MAM) is also a useful technique for non-
equilibrium modelling. I have supervised two excellent MAM PhD theses
(Feher 2019; Gooding 2019), and there are some issues in economics – such
as stock market dynamics, the evolution of pricing or the process of
innovation – where evolutionary MAM is the only way to go. However, the
overhead, in terms of programming skills, the difficulties in specifying and
testing a model, and in evaluating its results, is enormous. This results in
MAM projects often taking an order of magnitude longer to develop than
their developers expect, and two orders of magnitude longer than a
comparable system dynamics model. So, for reasons of parsimony, I

recommend system dynamics first, and MAM only for tasks which system
dynamics cannot undertake.
If you wish to delve deeper and actually contribute to a new, complex-
systems-aware economics, then you have a daunting but rewarding task of
contrarian education in economics ahead of you. I focus here on learning
economics suitable for complex systems modelling, rather than the broad
sweep of the history of economic thought, which you should also attempt to
master.
OceanofPDF.com

6.1 Your contrarian education in economics
Outside of a handful of universities that, for reasons given in chapter 1,
have a viable heterodox-friendly economics curriculum, you are not going
to learn the economics you need to know in a formal university degree. The
exceptions here include Leeds, Greenwich, SOAS and West England in the
UK, UMKC, Utah and Stony Brook in the United States, and those in
Europe associated with the EPOG program (see also the list of feasible
courses at The Mint site https://yrpri.org/group/3990 and the Heterodox
News site http://heterodoxnews.com/hed/study-programs.html). But, if you
do your degree at a top-ranked university – and I fully understand the
appeal of studying at a Cambridge or a Yale over, say, a Kingston – then
you are going to have to undertake this part of your education on your own
(however, if you find a rebel economist on staff at your Ivy League alma
mater, introduce yourself and learn from – and support – him or her).
On the positive side, today’s critical books and online resources provide a
far richer coverage of critiques of the mainstream and alternative
approaches to economics than was available in the 1970s. My Debunking
Economics (Keen 2011) collates a century’s worth of criticism that
Neoclassical economics has ignored, and whose consequences it has evaded
via ludicrous assumptions, only a handful of which I outlined in the
previous chapter. Organizations like the Institute for New Economic
Thinking provide online courses in alternative economic thought, and
student movements like Rethinking Economics mean that, as a rebel,
‘you’ll never walk alone’ – you’ll know you’re not the only one dissatisfied
with the conventional curriculum at your university, and eager to learn of
alternatives.
The most important alternative approaches to economics that you should
learn are Post Keynesian economics, Modern Monetary Theory, and
## Biophysical Economics.
The development of the Post Keynesian school of thought was driven by an
abhorrence of the unrealism underpinning Neoclassical economics, and it
has provided many powerful insights that can form the basis of realistic,
non-equilibrium, system dynamics models of the economy and ecology.
Foremost here, in my mind, are the models of Richard Goodwin (Goodwin

1966, 1967, 1982, 1986a, 1986b; Goodwin and Punzo 1987; Goodwin et al.
1986), and Wynne Godley (Godley 1999, 2004; Godley and Lavoie 2007;
Lavoie and Godley 2001), and the verbal models of Hyman Minsky
(Minsky 1963, 1972, 1977, 1982) that formed the basis of my own
modelling (Barnett et al. 2000; Keen 1995, 2000, 2013b, 2015b, 2020b).
There is also a wealth of other insights from Post Keynesian economics that
should inform your modelling, including Kalecki’s original engineering-
based models (Kalecki 1935, 1937, 1941, 1949, 1962, 1968, 1971), and
Sraffa’s meticulous multi-sectoral modelling, whose dynamic promise has
still not been properly explored (Keen 1998; Sraffa 1960, 1962; Steedman
## 1992, 1993).
There are excellent books documenting Post Keynesian economics, of
which the outstanding ones are Marc Lavoie’s Post-Keynesian Economics:
New Foundations (Lavoie 2015a) for a macroeconomic perspective and
Fred Lee’s Microeconomic Theory: A Heterodox Approach (Lee 2018) for a
micro perspective. There are journals dedicated to the Post Keynesian
approach, most notably the Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, the
Review of Political Economy, and the Review of Keynesian Economics.
John King provides a scholarly overview of the history of Post Keynesian
economics (King 2003, 2012, 2014). I also strongly recommend the
mathematician John Blatt’s recently re-published masterpiece Dynamic
Economic Systems: A Post Keynesian Approach (Blatt 1983).
There is one significant caveat as regards existing Post Keynesian economic
models: the overwhelming majority of these are expressed in ‘discrete time’
form. This partly reflects the Neoclassical education most Post Keynesian
economists acquired in their youth: almost all Neoclassical models use
‘difference equations’ – where variables are given values at times t, t + 1, t
+ 2, etc. (Sargent and Stachurski 2020a, 2020b)
## 2
– rather than differential
equations, where models are in terms of the rates of change of variables
with respect to time. Post Keynesian economists sometimes argue that this
method is necessitated by the nature of economic data, which comes in
discrete time steps (as yearly or quarterly data estimates). But Forrester,
who was arguably the authority on dynamic modelling, was emphatic that
this is completely wrong:

The incremental time intervals for which the variables of a model are
solved step-by-step in time must be much shorter than often supposed ...
This solution interval is unrelated to the interval at which national statistics
and economic indicators are measured. (Forrester 2003, pp. 337–45)
Discrete time is only really appropriate at the macro level for processes that
are highly synchronous – such as the synchronized birth of some animal
species, where the synchronization is an evolutionary survival mechanism.
In economics, while each individual transaction is discrete, each is also
asynchronous with respect to other transactions: all investments don’t occur
at the same time, but a difference equation setup assumes that they do. In a
‘top down’ model, aggregate asynchronous phenomena are far more
realistically modelled using continuous time than discrete time.
The time delays in discrete time economic models are also normally quite
arbitrary. They are almost always in terms of years, which is a reasonable
timeframe for investment, but not for consumption, where the scale should
be in terms of weeks or months rather than years. To do discrete time
modelling properly, consumption in period t should be modelled as
depending on income in period t − 2 (say), where the time period is
measured in weeks, while investment in period t should be modelled as
depending on the change in income between period t − 26 and t − 52 (say).
However, no-one actually does this, because it is simply too complicated: in
practice, lags of one year are the rule in macroeconomic discrete time
models. Secondly, if a discrete time model were done properly, and
empirical work later found that investment in period t actually depended on
the change in income between period t − 40 and t − 86 (say), then the entire
structure of the model would need to be re-written. This is not necessary for
a continuous time model, where the equivalent function to a time delay is a
time lag, which is represented by a simple scalar that can be altered easily.
Modern Monetary Theory is the other major area of modern non-
Neoclassical economics that you need to master, and there are now
excellent resources on this, including most importantly Kelton’s very
accessible The Deficit Myth (Kelton 2020), the MMT textbook
Macroeconomics by Mitchell, Wray and Watts (Mitchell et al. 2019), and
the blog New Economic Perspectives. There are also many other important
initiatives in non-Neoclassical economics today, including the work of Ole

Peters and colleagues in developing non-ergodic economic and financial
analysis (Peters 2019), with precursor work by J. Edgar Peters (Peters 1994,
1996, 2003) and Mandelbrot (Mandelbrot and Hudson 2004). You can
explore ecological economics at the website of The International Society for
## Ecological Economics.
Biophysical economics (Bobulescu 2015; Daly 1991b; Fontana and Sawyer
2016; Hall 2011; Hall et al. 2001) does not have as cohesive a canon as Post
Keynesian Economics or MMT, but this may change rapidly in the near
future. In the meantime, you should read the work on energy and economics
by numerous authors, including those above and Ayres et al. (2013),
Boulding (1992, 2009), Cleveland et al. (2001), Costanza et al. (1997), Daly
(1997, 1999, 2007), Daly and Farley (2011), Garrett (2014), Georgescu-
Roegen (1999, 2004), Keen et al. (2019), Kümmel (2011) and Voudouris et
al. (2015).
There are many online resources on heterodox economics in general, with
sites like the Heterodox Economics Newsletter and INET’s History of
Economic Thought website. You can also keep in touch with my own
contributions at my Patreon page www.patreon.com/profstevekeen, where
all but the podcasts are freely accessible.
Also consider doing a degree that lets you tailor your education, rather than
one like a standard Economics degree with its unavoidable Neoclassical
core,
## 3
and compulsory ancillary units in Econometrics and the like. I did a
combined Arts/Law degree where the Arts component let me choose any
Humanities, Science or Economics subjects, so I majored in Economics
while also doing Mathematics and Psychology. The Mathematics in
particular was invaluable, and it was one of the major reasons I became a
heterodox economist: I could see how flimsy the mathematical foundations
of Neoclassical economics were – and conventional labour-theory-of-value
Marxism, for that matter (Keen 1993a, 1993b).
If you do a degree in Economics, do so in a way that allows you to take as
many courses from outside the economics faculty as possible. Use your
electives to study mathematics, computing, thermodynamics, ecology and
history from the experts, rather than doing more courses taught by
Neoclassical economists. You could also major in mathematics, computing,
engineering or system dynamics directly, and then independently teach

yourself the fraction of economics that is actually worth learning, via online
resources and critical books.
There is much more to a completely new paradigm for economics than I
could cover in this book. But I hope there is enough here for you to see a
way in which you can help bring it about, while there is still a chance that
the economic system itself can survive the ecological crisis that
Neoclassical economics has, in large measure, doomed us to in the coming
decades.
I close this book by looking back on one of the most important books in my
own intellectual development, John Blatt’s Dynamic Economic Systems: A
Post-Keynesian Approach (Blatt 1983).
## 4
Blatt was not, in fact, an
economist, but a mathematician who, after a distinguished career in
mathematics and physics, was accidentally exposed to advanced
Neoclassical economics. He was horrified by what he saw, and especially,
by its obsession with equilibrium modelling. Speaking with the authority of
a leading figure in mathematical dynamics, he observed in the Introduction
to Dynamic Economic Systems that:
At present, the state of our dynamic economics is more akin to a crawl than
to a walk, to say nothing of a run. Indeed, some may think that capitalism as
a social system may disappear before its dynamics are understood by
economists. (Blatt 1983, pp. 4–5, emphasis added)
When I first read this in 1991, I thought it was a good piece of hyperbole. I
now regard it as a depressingly prescient prediction. Given the role that
Neoclassical economists have played in humanity making only trivial
responses to the challenge of climate change to date, the social system that
gets us through that challenge – if we do get through it – will be far more a
command than a market economy. For this reason, I regard Neoclassical
economics as not merely a bad methodology for economic analysis, but as
an existential threat to the continued existence of capitalism – and human
civilization in general. It has to go.

## Notes
1  If you want to bring about a new paradigm in economics, then I
urge you to use Minsky, and join our beta testers program to help
improve it over time. You can also sign up to its Patreon page
https://www.patreon.com/hpcoder/, or support it indirectly via my
Patreon page https://www.patreon.com/ProfSteveKeen. The models
in this book, and Minsky’s user interface, are documented in the
free companion to this book, Modelling with Minsky.
2  Sar gent’s two Macroeconomics with Python textbooks have only a
handful of differential equation models in their nearly 2,000 pages.
3  Speaking of cores, the so-called CORE textbook is a public-
relations-oriented repackaging of standard Neoclassical economics.
For example, its section on individual behaviour is straight
indifference curve/revealed preference thinking; its defense of this
model cites Milton Friedman’s dodgy ‘as if’ methodology; and it
makes no reference to a conclusive experiment that shows this
theory does not work as a model of human behaviour – ‘as if’ or
otherwise (Sippel 1997).
4  Blatt’ s exposition of Goodwin’s growth cycle model was much
clearer than Goodwin’s original, and this model became the basis of
my model of Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis. Blatt’s
explanations of the mathematical instability of general equilibrium
and the fallacies in expected utility theory are also first class.
