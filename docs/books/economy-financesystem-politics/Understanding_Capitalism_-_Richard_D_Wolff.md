“Rick Wolff is the most influential Marxist economist in America! His rich
intellectual range, from the decline of  the American empire to  the deeply
racist character of predatory capitalist processes, is  extraordinary! His
courageous and analytical voice is a light in our grim times!”
## —CORNEL WEST
“Richard Wolff’s  constructive and innovative ideas suggest new and
promising foundations for a   much more authentic democracy and
sustainable and equitable development, ideas that can be implemented
directly and carried forward. A  very valuable contribution in troubled
times.”
## —NOAM CHOMSKY
“There are  few economists who  are the equal of  Richard Wolff,  which he
once again proves with his latest book. Lucid, brilliant, and
uncompromising in his dissection of the capitalist system, he also provides
a sane and just socialist alternative to capitalist exploitation—one we must
all fight to achieve.”

## INTRODUCTION
or as long as we have had capitalism, people have disagreed about
what it is. Some have loved capitalism, some have hated it, and many
have  been  curious about  how  it  works and  why.  Not  surprisingly,
different  definitions shape  different  feelings about  capitalism, and  vice
versa.  Allow me  to  explain why  I  chose  to  write  a  book  that  defines
capitalism today.
Nowadays, many  people have  realized that  the  capitalist system is
riddled with  problems, but  they  lack  a  grasp  of  basic  concepts in
economics. Those concepts are needed to understand why capitalism had
these  problems and  to  evaluate the  different  “solutions” offered.  Basic
economics literacy is notoriously low in most parts of the world. School
courses, politicians’ statements, and mainstream media have often confused
or  mystified  people about  how  capitalism works. They  have  often  also
misled people by failing to explain the radically different ways different
people define and understand capitalism.
Here, our goal is to understand capitalism. So we begin with a basic
definition that we can use to understand it. However, this definition also
enables us to explain how and why others see capitalism differently. This
book is intended for all readers: those who like capitalism, those who don’t,
and those still undecided.
Over its roughly five centuries, capitalism spread to become the truly
global system it  is  today.  It  has  been  widely celebrated and  widely
criticized. The  same  happened  to  slavery,  feudalism, and  all  the  other
economic systems humans have tried. Sooner or later, intelligent people
inside all systems grasped that to understand any system requires carefully
considering the perspective of both those who celebrate it and those who do
not. Watching, listening to, or reading only either one yields a one-sided
perspective closer to propaganda than to genuine understanding. This book
offers a critical point of view that is all too often overlooked, denied, or

silenced. It offers that to those honest enough to dare to really consider both
sides, rather than  engage with  yet  another book  that  cheerleads for
capitalism instead of understanding it.
I cannot claim to be neutral in today’s challenging situation. Very, very
few people truly are. While most economists are pro-capitalist—as are most
politicians, media representatives, and academics in the US and beyond—I
am among the critics of capitalism. I became a critic because I saw the
everyday realities of this system grinding most people down for the benefit
of the few.
I’m convinced humans can do better than the existing system. The world
is going through so many crises—war, climate change, wealth inequality,
mass  migration,  and  civil  unrest—and meeting with  few  successes. I
believe that understanding capitalism—the basic economic system of our
times—offers us the key to addressing these crises successfully.

## HOW TO READ THIS BOOK
he capitalism in which we all live and struggle is in trouble. You, the
reader, are rightly interested in understanding why and how the system
is connected to all this trouble. I wrote this book to help you do exactly
that.
But no book’s writing occurs in a vacuum. Our world is full of different
and often  clashing views about the capitalist system. Whether you admire
capitalism or criticize it (or some of both), the terms and definitions you use
change depending on your opinion.
That means that writers who seek  to  be  clear must define in  their own
terms how they understand key concepts and ideas. I do that here in the first
two chapters. I  then proceed to use those defined terms to analyze
capitalism as a system (with special reference to the sources of its present
difficulties or troubles).
The opening chapters, on what capitalism is  and is  not,  may  be a  bit
challenging. The beginnings of analysis often are. Definitions of key
concepts and basic ideas seem far less interesting than what these concepts
tell us about the world that we live in—which is what we do with the topics
covered in the rest of the book.
The exciting and urgent issues about capitalism occupy its main, major
portions. You can see that in  the  detailed table of  contents. This book is
critical in  the sense that I  do not shy away from examining capitalism’s
flaws and weaknesses, because they are important sources of its problems.
Criticism also carries the obligation to discuss solutions: both reforms of the
system and transition to another system. The approach here does both.

## CHAPTER 1
## Defining Capitalism
## What It Is
cross capitalism’s history, as it spread from England in the seventeenth
century to become global today, its interactions with different nations,
cultures, and economic conditions led to different understandings of
capitalism. The  world  is  now  awash in  different  meanings of  the  basic
terms, concepts, and words we use to describe our economic systems. The
notions of right and wrong are not appropriate here; different people can
define terms they find useful in different ways.
Here  we  define “capitalism” as  the  name  of  one  particular way  that
human communities have  organized the  production of  the  goods and
services on which they depend. Ranging in size from families to nations or
the  entire  world, all  communities produce goods and  services. History
shows that human communities have organized their production systems in
different ways  in  different times  and  places. Each  of  these  particular
production systems arises, evolves, and  passes away.  Sometimes they
spread to other places. Sometimes multiple production systems exist in one
place at a time.
Today, capitalism is the dominant production system across most of the
world. It emerged from and spread during the decline of Europe’s previous
production system, called feudalism.  Centuries earlier,  that  feudal
production system had  emerged  from  the  decline and  collapse of  yet
another production system, slavery.
Capitalism, we presume, will follow the same path as other systems.
Rising out of the decline of previous production systems such as slavery
and feudalism, capitalism grew and evolved. Eventually, capitalism too will
pass away, and another production system will take its place.

To  understand capitalism, it  will  help  if  we  first  describe two  non-
capitalist systems.
Let’s start with slavery. That production system organizes its participants
into two connected groups: masters and slaves. Their basic relationship is
summarized by the fact that masters own slaves as property and thus wield
power over them. The slaves do most of the work but are excluded from
deciding what to produce, how and where the work is done, and what to do
with the end products. The other group, masters, makes all those decisions.
The slaves are not free; they don’t even own themselves. Masters control
everything even the slave’s participation in the system.
The masters take and distribute all of the slave system’s produced goods
and services, such as the crops slaves plant and pick. One portion of the
slaves’ output is typically sold by the master who owns it. The master then
uses  the  resulting revenue from  selling the  slaves’  output to  purchase
replacements for the inputs used up in production, such as seeds and tools.
A second portion of the slaves’ output, such as food, goes directly from the
master to sustain the slaves and their families. Masters sell the remaining
portion and keep the resulting revenue as their own income.
In slavery, masters could limit the portion of the slaves’ output that they
returned to the slaves for their consumption. Often, masters did limit or
reduce this portion returned to slaves because that left a bigger portion for
the masters. Because of that built-in incentive, masters often abused the
slaves they owned and brutally repressed slaves’ opposition or efforts to
escape. Eventually, slave resistance undermined the system. Relatively few
instances of the slave production system remain in today’s world.
Another non-capitalist production system, European feudalism,
organizes its participants differently, into lords and serfs. The serfs do most
of the work, while the lords make all the key decisions. However, unlike
slavery, the serf is not considered to be property of the lords. Instead, the
feudal system connects lords and serfs within a religious social order that
establishes and enforces a particular relationship between lord and serf. The
lord presides over the land, distributes portions of the land to serfs, and
protects the serfs so that they can work the land. In return, the serfs must
obey the lord and also deliver a portion of the output they produce (such as
crops) to the lord. The rest of the serfs’ output they can keep for themselves
and their families. Much like slavery, feudal lords take the outputs delivered
to them by their serfs and use them as they choose. If markets exist, lords

may  sell  those  delivered outputs for  money/revenue. One  part  of  such
revenue goes to the lord’s consumption (building castles, organizing feasts,
etc.). Another part might be used to purchase and replace inputs used in the
production activities  of  the  serfs  (tools, equipment, etc.).  Lords  would
distribute another part of their revenue to the church and the king to secure
their efforts to support the whole feudal system.
Like slavery, the feudal production system was eventually undone by
serfs  refusing to  accept it.  They  resisted and  tried  to  escape.  While
feudalism rejected the concept and institution of slavery, feudalism’s legally
“free” serfs  suffered  and  resented their  system’s  deep  inequalities.
Eventually, it too broke down.
These are straightforward explanations of these systems. But, the reality
is  that  human communities have  organized their  production systems in
multiple ways, even  during the  same  period in  history.  While each
production system can  exist  alone  in  a  community,  coexistence among
several is more usual.
For  example, slave  and  feudal systems can  and  do  coexist with
capitalism. The US Constitution’s Thirteenth Amendment explicitly allows
for  slavery  to  exist  inside US  prisons.  Likewise, some  traditional US
households and family farms are organized around the husband/father as
lord (of his castle), with the wife and older children as serfs. Participants
may not recognize the slave or feudal organization of their families and
households, and they may not use those words to define their situation, but
that does not prevent slavery or feudalism from being their reality.
These are simply possible examples; there is no necessity for slavery or
feudalism to coexist within an economy where capitalism is the prevalent
economic system.
So,  what  exactly is  the  unique production relationship defining
capitalism? The answer offered here represents what I have found to be the
most  effective definition, in  terms  of  the  understanding of  capitalism it
makes possible.
The Employer/Employee Relationship
In  its  best-known form,  the  capitalist production relationship connects
employers to employees by means of an exchange contract. Employees sell

their  capacity to  work  (their labor power)  to  employers for  a  wage.
Employers set  employees to  work  with  means of  production (tools,
equipment, raw  materials, etc.)  that  employers usually own.  Employers
organize the work to produce specific outputs.
Capitalism’s  distinctive production relationship excludes the  human
ownership of slavery and the interpersonal obligations of feudalism. Instead
of masters and slaves or lords and serfs, we have employers and employees.
The particular capitalist relationship differs from the slave and feudal
relationships in this way: in slavery and feudalism, the buying and selling of
labor power do not exist; in them, labor power is not a commodity. Many
forms  of  slavery and  feudalism have  markets in  productive resources,
products, and even enslaved persons (within chattel slavery). But, none of
those  forms  have  a  market where one  group  sells  their  labor  power to
another. The exchange of labor power is one unique activity that comprises
a different productive relationship, namely that of capitalism.
Capitalism’s employer-employee exchange comes with a condition: the
employer owns the output of the labor process automatically, as fast as the
employees produce it.
In modern capitalism, the marketplace is most often the main mechanism
of distribution of produced output. Most resources and products are owned
by employers who  buy  and  sell  resources/products as  commodities,
alongside buying and selling labor power as another commodity.
The employees use their wage payments to buy the consumer goods
needed to  reproduce their  own  labor  power (food, clothing, housing,
education, health care).  What  employees consume is  what  employees
produce. Employers occupy a middle position between employees while
wielding decisive power (in capitalism) over employees.
The  contractual relationship binding employers and  employees
differentiates capitalism from  alternative production systems.  Yet  the
capitalist system  also  shares some  important qualities with  slavery and
feudalism. For example, like them, in capitalism a very small minority of
the people involved in each workplace the employers (aka the owner, the
board of directors, the major shareholders) decide what most workplaces
produce, what technology they use, and what is done with the workplaces’
profits. Employees, the  vast  majority in  most  workplaces, are  excluded
from making those decisions. Yet employees must live with those decisions’
consequences (rather like slaves and serfs must live with the decisions made

exclusively by  masters and  lords, respectively). Their  very  unequal
divisions of authority within workplaces have been fundamental problems
for slavery, feudalism, and capitalism.
## Class
Here, I introduce and define the term “class” because this book uses class in
a particular way.
Many folks think of class in terms of power and wealth. Defining class
in terms of power, many people say that societies are divided among groups
with different amounts of power over others. Some people can order other
people to  do  or  behave in  certain ways.  Such  people are  said  to  have
authority: to be “order-givers” rather than “order-takers.” In contrast, other
people are said to be without authority: to be order-takers rather than order-
givers. The word “class” has often been used to describe such groups: the
powerful ruling class (those who give orders) versus the powerless or ruled
class (those who take orders). In between them, we find middle classes:
groups that have some power but not as much as those in the ruling class
which have a lot.
Class has also been used in a parallel way to describe the division of
wealth in a society or nation or community. The rich comprise the upper
class, while the poor comprise the lower class. Of course, there can be
middle classes whose wealth or income is somewhere between rich and
poor.
For many centuries, people have used these power or wealth concepts of
class to understand why communities work and change in particular ways.
Critics of social problems have often pointed to class differences as being
their major causes and proposed class changes as solutions. Supporters of
democracy have argued that its survival depends on most people in any
community being  in  the  middle classes, relatively equal  in  wealth and
power.
The  fact  is  that  for  a  long  time,  many  attempts have  been  made  to
overcome class differences as one key way to build a better society for all.
Successes have  so  far  been  only  partial and  temporary.  Extreme class
differences—in both power and wealth—continue to be widespread from
the US to China, from the global North to the Global South. Many have

tried to understand this problem. Why has it been so very difficult to avoid
or end extreme class differences in wealth and power? One approach to
answering this  key  question derives from  the  work  of  the  famed
philosopher, economist, and social critic Karl Marx. He believed that other
social thinkers who  had  sincerely  wanted to  overcome extreme class
differences failed to do so because they had missed or misunderstood a key
cause of those differences.
So  important  did  Marx  consider his  discovery that  he  built  a  whole
analysis of capitalism around it. In effect, Marx invented a new concept of
class—a new definition—that he then used to analyze capitalism. He knew
the previous concepts of class—those defined in terms of wealth and power
distributions—but he added, elaborated, and applied his new concept to
them.
Marx’s approach divides the people engaged in the capitalist production
system into two groups. One group is employers; the other is employees.
This is a different way of “classifying” people. Classes are not about how
much wealth they do or do not own or how much power they do or do not
wield. Class, for Marx, is about a person’s position in a production system.
Marx’s  unique class-analytical  approach to  understanding capitalism
spread quickly in his lifetime, and even faster after his death in 1883. In its
many interpretations, Marxism became a major global tradition of social
thought. This book uses Marx’s idea of class because of the unique and
powerful insights it offers into capitalism.
The employer class is extremely small. In the US, their numbers are
variously estimated (depending on the methods used) at between 1 and 3
percent of  the  adult  workforce. Estimates of  the  total  number  of US
businesses hover  around thirty-three million (but  most  of  those  are
individual self-employed enterprises).  In  contrast, the US  labor  force  (a
rough measure of all “employees”) is approximately 165 million people
(about half the US population). In class terms, the key reality here is that
there is a small class of employers compared to the much larger class of
employees.
Our adult population is mostly employees. Right there is a fundamental
problem. Employers decide what to produce, where to produce it, how to
produce it, and what to do with output (that belongs to them). Because
employees are not slaves or serfs, they are free to quit an employer and to
offer to another their capacity to work. Employers are free to accept or

reject any such offers, to hire and to fire. But, employees do not share with
employers the rights to control the production process, nor what to do with
the  products of  the  employees’  labor.  Employers retain those  rights
exclusively for themselves.
In the capitalist production system, then, one class wields huge powers
denied to  the  other  class.  Each  of  the  two  classes’  powers emerges  or
derives from their different positions within the organization of production.
If a society were, in general, to be committed to democracy—to a “one
person, one vote,” equal distribution of political power—capitalism’s very
different  organization of  production (not  at  all  “one  person, one  vote”)
would present an immediate, obvious problem (a point discussed in detail
later in this book, in “The Problems of Capitalism: Undemocratic”).
Marx’s class analysis can be applied to non-capitalist economic systems.
In slavery and feudalism, the top classes (masters and lords) gathered into
their hands hugely disproportional shares of wealth and power. Critics of
those systems railed against their extreme inequalities of wealth and power.
Marx’s  concept of  class  again  focused on  their  production systems to
explain how those systems distributed wealth and power.
When slaves and  serfs  refused  to  continue within slave  and  feudal
productive systems, they  demanded “freedom” from  those  systems, and
many embraced capitalism as  the  way  forward  to  a  “free  society.”
Employees were neither slaves nor serfs. Employees were free and only
voluntarily entered into the capitalist production system. This could be seen
as an improvement from the previous systems. Yet capitalism’s employees
were  also  those  who  worked, produced, and  generated wealth that
employers took  and  distributed to  keep  the  capitalist production system
going.
Marx’s  new  class  analysis, focused on  the  employer/employee
relationship, enabled him  to  pinpoint what  had  to  be  changed—in all
production systems, including capitalism—to end  the  wealth and  power
inequalities those systems all shared. Any production system that positioned
a small minority in charge of a large majority had to be changed.
Capitalism’s  champions had  promised their  system would end  the
inequalities of wealth and power associated with slavery and feudalism.
Capitalism they  insisted, would bring about liberty,  equality,  and
democracy. Marx argued that capitalism failed to deliver on its promises
because, in place of the master/slave and lord/serf dichotomies, it installed

the  employer/employee system. To  achieve the  promises of  capitalism
requires going beyond employer/employee to a new production system that
does not divide the people engaged in production into the powerful versus
the  powerless, the  rich  and  the  poor.  The  capitalist organization  of  the
workplace is  the  obstacle to  realizing the  noble  goals  of  capitalism’s
original champions.
In  capitalist,  feudal, and  slave  production systems, Marx  noted  the
workers (employees, serfs, slaves) produce “surpluses” for persons other
than themselves. That is, they produce a quantity of output greater than that
necessary to provide for those employees’ standards of consumption and to
replace used-up means of production. The difference between total outputs
produced by slaves, serfs, and employees and what each of those classes
received for their own consumption plus used-up inputs was what Marx
called “surpluses.” Because all such workers produced surpluses for others
(for masters, lords, and employers, but not for themselves), Marx referred to
them as “exploited.”
Progressive critics of capitalism have always opposed exploitation as
perhaps capitalism’s fundamental injustice. Yet the very idea or concept of
exploitation immediately brings to  mind  the  question: What  would a
nonexploitative production system be? The answer this book provides is the
worker cooperative: a workplace where the relationship among participants
is  a  democratic  community.  Each  participant in  the  activities of  the
workplace has one vote in making its basic decisions: what, how, and where
to produce and how to utilize the output of the workplace. The surplus
produced by such a workers’ cooperative would not be immediately taken
by others. It would instead belong to and be distributed by the workers who
produced it. (See the discussion of this key point in the last chapter of this
book, entitled “What Comes After Capitalism?”)
Exploitative economic systems like slavery and feudalism prevented the
dreams of  liberty,  equality,  and  democracy from  becoming realities.
Capitalism promised  to  make  these  dreams a  reality,  but  it  failed. And
Marx’s work exposed why: capitalism, too, had installed an exploitative
economic system.
The good news is that we now know what needs to be done. We need to
transition our economic system from its capitalist (i.e., employer/employee)
organization of  workplaces to  democratically organized worker

cooperatives. We must end capitalist exploitation, much as our ancestors
ended slavery and feudalism.
## Capital
Why,  you  may  rightly wonder,  is  capitalism not  called “the
employer/employee system” or some other phrase that describes its specific
qualities as a production system? The answer is historical.
The concepts of capital and capitalist long predated the existence and
spread of  the  employer/employee production system. Put  simply,  those
concepts referred to one particular use of money: using money to make
more money.
Money can be used to purchase something to make practical use of it (as
in buying something to consume it). Money could also be given as a gift.
This money would not be called capital. What is capital is money when it is
used to generate more money. Capital, in other words, is self-expanding
money.
Think of a value of money—say $100—that is used in a way that ends
up with its owner having more than $100. The simplest example is money
loaned at interest. The borrower is then required to return the value of the
loan plus 5  percent interest (a fee charged to the borrower). A one-year
$100 loan will yield $105 a year later (return of principal, $100, plus a $5
interest payment). Lending money at interest turns that money into capital.
Another simple example is using money as storekeepers or merchants
do. They buy in order to resell at a  higher price. Your corner store buys
potato chips at a (wholesale) price that’s lower than what it charges you (the
retail  price). In  this  way,  the  store  owner expands the  value  of  money:
money used as capital.
Please note  that  neither loan  capital nor  merchant capital directly
involves production. The  loan  with  interest involves the  change of
ownership of money between lender and borrower, not the production of
anything. A merchant’s business of buying low and selling high involves no
production either. As you can see, production is a separate activity from
these forms of capital, and it happens before any merchant buys and resells
what was earlier produced.

For most of human history, production was not primarily done to make
money. In all previous eras, production was motivated by all sorts of goals,
but it was not primarily driven by capital, the attempt to use money to make
more money.
A whole new era of human history began when capital grew beyond
lending and merchanting and became directly engaged in production. The
employer/employee organization  of  production not  only  replaced earlier
slave and feudal organizations of production but also brought capital into
the  center of  the  production system. It  was  properly called  a  capitalist
production system  because “making money” was  its  logic,  its  “law  of
motion,” and its “bottom line.”
How does money’s self-expansion occur within the employer/employee
relationship?
## Surplus
When an employer puts a hired laborer to work with equipment and raw
materials to make a product, the employer expends a total sum of money to
buy  and  gather all  those  components into  a  workplace or  enterprise.
Because an employer uses money to produce with the goal of expanding
value, that money is “capital,” and such an employer is a capitalist. The
goal is to end the production process with something worth more in value
than the total sum of value the employer put into production in the first
place.
What  is  critical to  understand here  is  that  the  value  grows during
capitalist production because of the employer/employee relationship. The
value of the product includes the values of all the component inputs used up
in the process of production (the used-up equipment, facilities, and raw
materials). The employee’s labor adds to those inputs’ value to yield the
total value of production’s output. The product of production is worth more
than the value of the used-up inputs that are contained in it. The increased
value comes from what the labor adds.
Now, here comes the key point. The employer (or someone designated
by  the  employer) manages the  production process to  make  money.  But
exactly how does the employer end up with more value in the product than
the employer expended on the inputs plus the cost of getting the laborer to

work? The answer is this: the employer must be able to pay a wage or
salary to the employee that has less value than that added by the worker’s
labor during production. The output of capitalist production includes the
value added by the worker, but it only costs the employer the value of the
wage that the worker requires to perform the work. The value added by the
worker’s  labor  minus the  value  paid  to  the  worker as  a  wage  is  the
“surplus.” The employer spends value on production that equals the value
of the used-up inputs plus the value of the wage paid to the worker. The
employer realizes the value of the output (when it is sold) that contains (1)
the value of the used-up inputs, plus (2) the value paid to the worker for
working, and (3) the surplus (or excess of worker’s value added over the
wage paid).
The difference between the value added by laborers and wages paid to
them is the key to capitalism. It is that “more” that enables money or value
to self-expand by means of capitalist production. The “more” (originally
mehr in Marx’s German-language writings) was translated into English as
## “surplus.”
Thus “surplus value” is the goal and driver of the employer/employee
production system; it is quite literally what makes it capitalist. Employers
get the surplus produced by their employees. As it is produced, it becomes
the employers’ property. That happens automatically. Many capitalists and
many employees never quite grasp or understand the system that connects
them.
If the employer decides to keep the enterprise going (exclusively the
employer’s decision), that employer must use the revenue from selling its
outputs (which belong exclusively to that employer) in particular ways. One
portion of the revenue buys physical inputs to replenish those used up in
production. A  second portion is  paid  in  wages to  the  employees who
produced those products. A third and final portion—the surplus value is
used by the employer to secure certain conditions needed for the enterprise
to keep going.
These conditions include, for example, hiring lawyers to manage any
legal issues that might impede the enterprise’s reproduction over time or
paying taxes to the state so it can maintain services on which the employer
relies (roads, police, public education, etc.).
Still another condition would be hiring employees who do not produce
surplus but instead perform functions that enable surpluses to be produced

by other employees. For example, let’s consider a ladder factory that hires a
clerk to manage the paperwork to keep track of payroll, billing, or legal
obligations. The clerk produces neither ladders nor the surplus that ladder-
producing workers do. Yet the clerk is as important to a successful capitalist
enterprise as  the  direct  ladder-producer (the  one  who  uses  tools  and
equipment to transform wood into ladders). Employees like this clerk are
enablers: they enable other workers to produce the surplus that drives the
capitalist enterprise. The enabler class in capitalism includes such workers
as clerks, sales personnel, security, supervisors, and so on. So now we see
that capitalism entails a complex class structure. Employees include both
surplus-producing workers and non-surplus-producing enablers.
In the long history of economics, key contributors such as Adam Smith
and Karl Marx referred to these groups as “productive” and “unproductive”
workers. While they  defined these  terms differently,  they  all  aimed
analytically to  break down the  important category of  wage-earning
employees. Even  everyday language  has  tried  to  grasp  such  differences
among workers with terms like “white collar” and “blue collar.” In this
book, “productive” workers are those who directly produce the surpluses
that employers aim to maximize. Unproductive workers are those who help
create the conditions that enable productive workers to produce surpluses.
The difference between “productive” and “unproductive” does not refer
to  the  importance of  these  two  groups of  workers. Both  groups are
indispensable to the survival and persistence of the capitalist enterprise,
albeit in different ways. We differentiate the two groups in terms of their
relationships to  the  surplus because it  helps  us  understand capitalism
according to this book’s definition.
The lower the wages employers can pay to any worker, the greater the
share of workers’ value added that employers take as surplus. Capitalism—
the  employer/employee organization  of  production—thus sets  employers
against employees. Lower wages are typically pursued by employers and
resisted by employees. In contrast, employees perpetually seek to increase
wages to improve their families’ standards of living. Capitalism has always
been a system torn by internal conflicts and struggles between employers
and employees.
These economic conflicts and struggles influence and are shaped by the
politics and culture of every society where the capitalist economic system
prevails. Do schools teach children about how capitalism works? Is labor

unionization fostered or demonized in the culture? Do political struggles
mobilize public opinion to support one class against another, or do they
deflect popular opinion away from class issues so as to support the class
status quo? The ways such questions are answered show how those and
other  aspects of  society shape how  much surplus each  enterprise’s
employers can appropriate, and how successfully those employers can use
those surpluses to hire and direct the enablers to do their part.
## Profit
We  know  that  the  profit  drive  is  the  heart  of  capitalism. That’s  why
businesses say things like “Profit is our bottom line,” “We’re in business to
make profit,” or a hundred other ways of saying it. But what exactly is
profit? Two  particular distributions  of  surplus by  employers became so
important that a special term was invented for them: “profit.”
The first version of “profit” refers to when surplus is used to grow or
expand the enterprise: (1) to buy more or different physical inputs instead of
simply replenishing those used up, and (2) to hire more employees to work
with those inputs and produce more output.
The other particular distribution of surplus labeled “profit” is made to
the owners of the enterprise: a kind of “return” on the capital such owners
had made available to (“invested in”) the enterprise.
Profit  became a  kind  of  shorthand  index  for  how  well  a  capitalist
enterprise was doing because it measured how much surplus value was left
over after the employer had secured all the other necessary conditions to
continue producing. Profit was that part of the surplus that employers could
distribute to  owners of  the  enterprise for  two  specific purposes: (i)  for
owner(s)’ consumptions and (ii) to increase owners’ wealth (by growing the
enterprise). Profit reflected and  thus  measured how  successfully an
employer had operated a capitalist enterprise.
We would better analyze an enterprise by looking at all distributions of
surplus. Profit  is  after  all  just  two  among that  became the  key  number
capitalists use to gauge each enterprise’s financial health. Indeed, there are
other distributions of surplus that are also important for its future.
It  is  easy  to  slip  into  the  habit  of  treating “surplus” and  “profit” as
interchangeable, as synonyms. In some cases, that incurs no confusion; in

others, it does. In one important way, surplus and profit can be considered
together despite  their  differences. All  surplus distributions—including
profits—are important ways  to  secure an  enterprise’s  continuation or
reproduction. Inadequate distribution of portions of the surplus risks not
reproducing capitalism’s  conditions,  thereby threatening the  enterprise’s
survival.
A major problem for capitalists is the nature of their relationship with
one another. That relationship includes competition. What each capitalist
does  to  be  profitable, reproduce, and  even  grow  can,  and  usually does,
threaten the existence of other capitalists. Thus, capitalists seek profits both
to defend against their competitors and to obtain advantages over them.
For example, consider a group of capitalist enterprises that produce and
sell chairs to the same community of buyers. The interactions between the
multiple businesses  selling into  their  shared market creates a  pressure
expressed by the term “competition.” In order to survive, each business
must  sell  outputs for  revenues which it  then  uses  to  replenish used-up
inputs, pay wages, and distribute its surplus value to secure the conditions
needed to reproduce the enterprise. Each capitalist chair-producer faces the
risk that chair buyers will patronize another “competing” business. Each
capitalist seeks ways to take business away from its competitors. It can, and
often does, become a life-and-death struggle.
Competition might  drive  one  capitalist to  improve the  quality of  its
chairs and/or reduce their price. To sustain its profits such a capitalist would
try  to  find  cheaper  productive  inputs. Alternatively,  that  same  capitalist
might  send  less  of  its  surplus  to  secure conditions of  that  enterprise’s
existence, such  as  security guards, secretaries, etc.  Every other  chair
capitalist, threatened by the first’s improved quality or lowered price, would
pursue the same or comparable steps. “Competition” is what we call this
tense coexistence. It’s a constant pressure on and danger to capitalists. As
we shall see, it also underlies capitalists’ endless quest for growth. A bigger
enterprise is often better able to compete than a smaller one.
That  is  how  capitalism works.  Profits are  usually devoted partly  or
wholly to growing the enterprise. Capitalist enterprises are profit driven
because profit is often what fuels growth. Expansion is itself a condition of
an  enterprise’s  competitive survival. More  employees producing outputs
means more surplus to secure conditions of the enterprise’s existence and
reproduction.

Companies are terrified if their profits go down. Will people then stop
investing in the company? Will vendors with whom they do business stop
extending credit?  Will  customers begin  to  look  elsewhere (maybe to
competitors)? Might banks hesitate to lend to the company?
Profit has thus become a key marker, measure, and criterion of the health
of  every  capitalist enterprise. Rising profits as  a  share  of  total  capital
invested (a  rising profit rate)  is  good  news  for  vendors, lenders, and
investors that the capitalist enterprise deals with. Profits are what the media
consider when  commenting on  an  enterprise’s  condition and  prospects.
Falling profits send  the  same  audience the  opposite news. Corporate
executives’ jobs tend to be more secure and better paid when profits are
rising. However, recent decades have shown that top US executives obtain
improved salaries and bonuses even when their enterprises’ profits fall.
Capitalism’s “high priests”—the professional economists—spin the tales
(they  prefer to  call  them  theories) that  justify the  system. They  try  to
persuade us  that  capitalists’  “profit maximization” achieves the  greatest
efficiency, economic growth, and the greatest good for the greatest number
of  people.  They  want  us  to  believe that  the  self-serving (profit-driven)
behavior of the employer class is, magically, the best for employees too.
It is always difficult to keep track of the multiple causes of profit. Thus,
many choose to focus instead on one or two “key” causes or aspects. Across
capitalism’s  history,  the hope  that  profits show  an  enterprise’s  overall
economic health became the presumption  that  they  do. Average profits
across industries and  entire economies likewise became indices of
economic well-being.
One immediate problem with such a standard or measure is that it opens
the possibility that profits may be high and rising because wages, taxes, and
living conditions are falling. Is such a capitalist system healthy or not? If
profit earners (a tiny minority) own and run the media, politicians, and
academics, that minority’s well-being may result in the “news” that the
economy is prospering. If most people live off wages and salaries and the
decline of the latter imposes suffering on them, they might find the same
economy to be the opposite of prosperous. Nothing about profit is neutral or
the same for all in society; it is a highly contested concept, as are all basic
economic concepts if one looks at them closely.
Capitalists don’t focus on profit because they are greedy. Rather, greed is
another name  for  the  profit  drive  that  competition requires and  thus

cultivates in  capitalists. The  capitalist system imposes  profit-driven
behavior upon  individual capitalists. If  and  when  individual employers
adapt  to  capitalism’s  profit  drive,  we  may  call  them  “greedy,”  but  the
system shapes and imposes on the individual far more than the reverse. The
capitalist system’s  profit  drive  is  the  cause; greediness is  the  effect.  Of
course, the effect can and does react back upon its cause. Greedy individual
employers may become capitalist employers and perhaps excel in profit-
making.
For  every  example where profit-driven behavior leads  to  a  good
outcome, there is another that exposes profit-driven behavior leading to
awful outcomes. The  profit drive  may  have  resulted in  dynamic
technological improvements, but  this  also  helped cause colonialism,
imperialism, and some of the most destructive wars in human history. It
now even threatens our ecological survival. The profit motive yields, at
best, mixed results. To imagine that profit magically guides economies to
optimal goodness, growth, and prosperity is above all capitalists’ wishful
thinking.
Profit maximization is how capitalists accumulate wealth. That may be
good for them, but it’s not at all good for the rest of us. Keeping profits
away from employees guarantees they will always need employment from
capitalists, locking employees in a cycle of exploitation and dependence on
wages. Capitalists and workers have never been equal beneficiaries of the
system.
So that’s capitalism: employers use employees to produce surplus and
profit, and employers distribute the surplus for their own benefit and, under
the pressure of competition, for the growth (or at least reproduction) of their
enterprises.
Knowing now what capitalism is, we should ask ourselves an important
question: What are we doing allowing our very lives and societal well-being
to depend on the decisions of a tiny minority who forever prioritize that one
small portion of enterprise revenue called profit?
Before we can invest ourselves in this question, I’m guessing there may
be some questions or counterarguments forming in your mind.
We can address those by unraveling some other definitions of capitalism
that you may have heard of.

## CHAPTER 2
## Defining Capitalism
## What It Is Not
he task of defining anything includes separating what it is from what it
is not. That means we must define boundaries between an object and
its surroundings. We define a “dog” as an “animal,” but we must also
show  how  it  differs  from  other  animals, like  a  “cat.”  The  boundaries
comprising a  definition are  crucial to  understanding “dog” because
“animal” is not enough. The same applies to defining capitalism. To be
clear  about  what  this  economic  system is,  we  have  to  separate it  from
others.
This  chapter’s  discussion of  what  capitalism is not  will  add  those
clarifying boundaries to its definition. This is especially important because
these  boundaries will  also  help  us  separate the  very  different ways
capitalism has been understood.
It Is Not Private Enterprise or Private Property
Most advocates of capitalism heavily emphasize what is “private”—what is
“mine,” “yours,” or “someone else’s.” To them, capitalism is a system of
“free” or  “private” enterprises and  private ownership: a  system where
private individuals  start,  own,  and  operate enterprises mostly free  of
government interference and where those individuals decide how to run
enterprises or what to do with them.
First of all, private or free enterprises existed in most slave or feudal
economic systems.  They  are  not  unique to  and  thus  do  not  define
capitalism. Individuals often could and did buy slaves, setting them to work
in  private  enterprises that  operated in  classic master/slave fashion. The
same happened often in feudalism as private individuals entered into lord-

serf  relationships within feudal enterprises. Whatever distinguishes
capitalist from other enterprises, their “private” or “free” nature is not it.
It is, of course, possible for a state to set up and operate a business
enterprise. State officials can buy inputs and hire workers, produce and sell
outputs. In virtually all societies that have ever called themselves capitalist,
states have done that. In the US, examples are many: the US Postal Service,
Amtrak, the Tennessee Valley Authority, thousands of local utilities owned
by  municipalities, states  operating colleges and  universities, and  so  on.
Most citizens and commentators do not deny the US is capitalist because of
those state-owned and -operated businesses. To be fair, a few people do
those  for  whom any  state-owned and  -run  enterprise is  a  negation of
capitalism.
Slavery and feudalism, like capitalism, exhibited coexistences of private
and state enterprises. Virtually no student of slavery ever concluded that
slavery ceased to exist when states joined individuals in buying slaves and
setting them to work. Likewise, students of feudalism around the world
noted  that  states  as  well  as  private lords  operated feudal production
systems. Such students did not conclude that feudalism had been abolished
when states joined private enterprises.
A relatively small number of people—in the US today, they take the
name “libertarians”—believe that the private-versus-state difference defines
capitalism. Their evident hatred for state apparatuses is clearly reflected in
their way of defining capitalism.
Most nations labeled as “capitalist” actually include both private and
state  enterprises; so  too  do  most  nations labeled as  “socialist.” The
proportions of private versus state enterprises vary from nation to nation,
from time to time within nations, and likewise within systems. Thus, the
private-versus-state difference is  not  a  clear  way  to  separate economic
systems; it is weak as a definition.
Capitalism does  not  uniquely incentivize private enterprise  either.
Capitalism has its own ways of preventing private enterprises from forming.
For example, with typical patent and trademark systems, capitalists who
develop something new can forbid other capitalists from making the same
thing  for  many  years.  Also,  capitalist competition drives employers to
control the market and stop other enterprises from entering the industry.
These are ways that capitalism often blocks or thwarts private enterprises.

Other  noncapitalist systems likewise incentivize and  disincentivize the
formation of enterprises, both private and state.
Private property is not unique to capitalism either. Once again, private
property coexists with state or collective property within slave, feudal, and
other production systems, just like capitalist systems. As with enterprises,
the  relative  quantities of  private versus nonprivate property  in  each
production system may vary over time and across places. Land, animals,
machines, money, and much else have long histories as both private and
state property in many different systems.
Accusing anti-capitalists of  generally opposing or  abolishing private
property is  historically inaccurate. However,  there  are  political and
ideological goals in defining anti-capitalism in such terms. The accusation
that socialism, for example, is anti-private property scares some people,
who believe that socialism somehow threatens their private belongings. Not
only is that mostly untrue but there are examples in capitalist systems when
private property  is  rejected. The US  legal principle of  eminent domain
grants the government the right to take private property from its owners
without their consent and convert it into state property so long as “fair
compensation” is  paid  for  it. US  capitalism has  thus  recognized  the
legitimacy of state property and the curtailment of private property.
Equating capitalism with private property is a mistake.
## It Is Not Markets
Markets, too, are not unique to capitalism, nor do they define it. Yet many
persist in  referring to  capitalism as  “the  market system” or  the  “free
market.”
Markets are  a  way  of  distributing  goods and  services that  preceded
capitalism by many centuries. Markets enable producers to transfer their
products to consumers by means of exchange. If sellers and buyers can
reach an agreement on the terms of their exchange, products change hands.
Plato and Aristotle wrote about markets and their social effects in the
fourth century BC (and they both criticized markets). Markets often began
as  sporadic events occurring at  the  edges of  communities  and  then
sometimes matured  into  regular events integrated into  the  lives  of
communities and  entire  regions. Markets accommodated both  long-  and

short-distance trade and traders. In slave societies, slaves were often bought
and  sold  in  markets alongside products of  slave  labor.  In feudalism,
products of serf labor were also bought and sold in marketplaces.
Perhaps to differentiate capitalism from these earlier markets, some folks
claim capitalism is “the free market system,” with “free” meaning a market
system with  minimal or  no  outside  (i.e.,  governmental) intervention or
regulation. In such “free” markets, buyers and sellers bargain unregulated
by any political authority.
The problem is, such free markets existed rarely and only briefly. Most
markets are full of regulations imposed upon market exchanges, usually by
governments.
Consider a labor market where businesses pay very little and desperate
people must accept low wages. Very poor people have eventually demanded
help  in  the  form  of  a  market regulation mandating a  legally enforced
minimum wage. For example, the nineteenth- and twentieth-century labor
market for immigrants working on farms in the US gave employers the
power to impose on employed farmworkers both awful conditions and low
wages. The  supply of  desperate immigrants was  large,  and US  farm
employers were  ruthless in  their  drive  for  profits. Immigrant workers’
efforts to regulate that market were defeated by employers’ counter-efforts
for  a  long  time,  but  eventually,  through great  struggle, unions like  the
United Farm  Workers of America arose,  and  won  government-imposed
protective regulations. Their  successful advocacy for  better  working
conditions and a higher minimum wage reflects unions’ understanding of
markets as a human invention they try to shape to their needs.
Capitalism once displayed armies of child laborers who were paid poorly
and  treated badly.  Eventually,  workers fought against this  practice, and
regulations banned child  labor,  thereby intervening in  capitalism’s  labor
markets. Sexual abuse of  employees, ecological damages, deceptive
products, and  countless other  factors demanded and  eventually got
government regulation of capitalist markets. Unregulated “free” markets are
much more a utopian ideal than an existing reality across the history of
markets.
Long  ago, Aristotle and  Plato  argued  that  markets undermine social
cohesion—what we  might  now  call  “community.”  They  agreed in  their
critiques of markets, but they disagreed over what to do about markets’
socially undesirable effects. For example, markets favor the rich. The rich

can more easily afford the means to become richer. Markets thus can, and
often  do,  worsen the  inequality of  wealth among members of  the
community. That, in turn, provokes envy and jealousy among them. It also
provokes the rich to use their wealth to protect that wealth by influencing
politicians and mass media in ways the poor cannot match. Debaters since
Plato and Aristotle have often agreed with their criticisms of markets and
likewise disagreed over whether to simply ban market exchange or else to
regulate it. (The chapter “Myths of Capitalism,” later in this book, further
details these harmful effects of markets.)
While markets in general are not unique to capitalism, the market for one
particular product  was  so  unique to  capitalism that  it  has  become
definitional. That particular commodity is labor power. In capitalism, the
worker sells labor power: the capacity to contribute brains and muscles to
production. The  worker owns  and  sells  labor  power to  the  capitalist
employer. The capitalist buys and then “consumes” that labor power by
combining the worker with tools, equipment, and raw materials to produce
a  product.  The  capitalist owns  and  sells  that  product. The  labor  power
market is the only market that does not typically occur in other systems of
production. Masters do not buy the labor power of slaves; they buy the
slaves themselves. Lords do not buy the labor power of serfs; rather, they
enter into a personal relationship with serfs that includes serfs working for
lords. That  personal relationship  is  not  and  does  not  include the
buying/selling of anyone’s labor power.
Why,  then,  does  the  confused,  mistaken notion that  capitalism is  a
market system persist? The  answer lies  in  grasping what  this  idea
accomplishes when it is believed.
Defining capitalism in terms of markets—how goods and services are
distributed—takes attention away from how they are produced. The world
of  markets  can  be  presented as  a  place  of  fairness and  equality.  In  the
marketplace, I don’t give you something unless I get something satisfying
in return. Therefore, a market exchange is a “voluntary” act. Each person is
formally equal and free to exchange as they like. These kinds of freedom
and fairness can be associated with markets and, thus, with capitalism.
To  define capitalism as  the  employer/employee relationship returns
attention to production rather than distribution. In production, the wealth
and power of the employer and employee are clearly unequal. One is rich
and powerful; the other is not, or at least much less so. Employees do not

elect  employers. In  capitalist workplaces, employers rule;  their  lack  of
democratic accountability to the majority, the employees, is obvious. It’s far
easier to defend capitalism in terms of markets than in terms of production.
Hence, defenders  prefer the  market definition, often  to  the  point  of
proceeding as if other definitions did not exist.
In this book, I will not refer to capitalism as “the market system,” “free
market system,” “private enterprise system,” or “free enterprise system.”
These labels may defend and distract, but they do not distinguish capitalism
from many other systems. As definitions, they fail.
## Why Definitions Matter
There’s nothing innocent about a definition. Perhaps you have not heard of
the employer/employee definition of capitalism before. If so, that is mostly
because capitalism’s  defenders fear  where that  definition leads. Not
surprisingly,  capitalists prefer definitions that  better  shield their  system
from criticism.
Over  the  last  few  centuries, capitalism’s  defenders developed many
strategies to counter critiques of their system. For example, defenders have
attached adjectives to the noun “capitalism” to suggest that any problems or
negatives capitalism exhibits reflect some impurity that somehow corrupted
an  otherwise “perfect” system. Examples of  these  adjectives include
## “monopoly,”  “cutthroat,” “imperialist,” “vulture,” “casino,” “crony,”
“robber baron,” and other negatives. When capitalism’s defenders admit
that such “bad” sorts of capitalism exist, they often insist that they are
distortions. A “pure” or “real” or “perfectly competitive” capitalism exists
and  can  be  achieved. They  often  advocate policies for  governments to
follow that replace “bad” sorts of capitalism with real, pure, competitive
perfection.
With the definition of capitalism advanced in this book, problems that
arise from capitalism cannot be brushed aside as if they were correctable
adjectives. Capitalism’s  employer/employee core  is  fundamentally  anti-
democratic. A  tiny  group of  people—employers—make all  the  key
workplace decisions for  a  large  group  of  people—employees—and the
employees have no say. There is no “fix” for capitalism that removes its
anti-democratic qualities and  leaves democratic capitalism behind. To

democratize capitalist enterprises would be to end their capitalist qualities.
In a democratic enterprise, no minority would wield power over a majority:
not employers, nor feudal lords, nor slave masters.
The employers and fans of capitalism celebrate their system by repeating
that it achieved liberty, equality, solidarity, and democracy in society. In
practice, capitalism neither achieved those goals nor took responsibility for
failing to do so. Some urge us to “get money out of our politics,” yet our
capitalist economic system not only creates inequality in production but
also thereby enables employers to protect their disproportionate wealth by
using money to rig the political system in their favor. The undemocratic
structure of the employer/employee relationship colonizes our politics to
serve capitalism and to reproduce that system.
In  capitalism today,  we  see  employers controlling and  exploiting
employees, a dearth of real democracy, and deep inequality. To those able
and willing to see, the similarities and parallels to feudalism and slavery
should be arresting.
Current debates about  our  society’s  problems and  prospects  need  to
refocus. It  is  time  to  expose  and  challenge capitalism’s  core:  the
employer/employee organization of enterprises, both private and state. We
need to drop the taboo on questioning how we organize the workplaces
where most adults spend most of their lives. Workplace organizations affect
our lives and shape our societies. A shift away from one form of workplace
organization and  toward another can  help  solve  social problems and
political inequality.  To  that  end,  we  need  to  challenge capitalism’s
workplace organization and escape its constraints on our politics.
Some  masters  tried  to  save  slavery by  promising a  different, more
compassionate slavery. However, slaves and their allies eventually grasped
that the basic problem was not what kind of slavery existed; the problem
was slavery itself. Slavery had to end, and debates over its many problems
were finally resolved by abolishing the system completely. Likewise, some
kings and queens tried to hold to the monarchical system by supporting and
crowning more  popular kings. Other  monarchs allowed parliaments to
“advise” them. Eventually, people no longer tolerated the exchange of one
kind  of  monarchy for  another; they  wanted monarchy’s  abolition.
Capitalism now  faces  that  same  historic resolution. Beyond another
“reform” of capitalism, its abolition is on the agenda.

Definitions matter more now than ever as people increasingly question
and  challenge capitalism, seeking to  move beyond it.  The
employer/employee definition of  capitalism helps  us  understand this
production system,  prepare alternatives, and  propose a  transition to  a
genuinely post-capitalist production system. With this definition, we can
clearly understand why and in what way we need to change the production
system to go beyond capitalism to a better system.

## CHAPTER 3
The Problems of Capitalism
ll economic systems have problems. To change from one economic
system to  another means solving key  problems from  the  first  and
encountering new  problems in  the  second, some  foreseen and
foreseeable, others not. During the eighteenth century, it was possible to
publicly discuss and debate capitalism’s strengths and weaknesses where it
was  emerging  (see  especially the  writings of  Adam Smith and  David
Ricardo). In the nineteenth century, the discussions and debates intensified
as  capitalism matured and  spread,  while  also  provoking the  profound
critical response of the socialist traditions (above all via Marx, among many
others). However, the quality of debate and discussion changed at the end of
the nineteenth and early in the twentieth century. Those were times when
socialists based in the employee class became sufficiently numerous and
well-organized to  challenge capitalist employers for  control of
governments. Sometimes, the challenges were  electoral, while  at  other
times, they were revolutionary.
Once the global struggles of the twentieth century became understood as
capitalism versus socialism (chiefly after the Russian Revolution of 1917),
public debate and  discussion very  often  deteriorated into  lopsided
celebrations of one accompanied by denunciations of the other. Debate and
discussion gave way to propaganda battles. This happened especially after
World War II when the alliance of the US and the Soviet Union collapsed
into  Cold  War  opposition. Then  propaganda virtually dwarfed serious,
careful discussion and debate. Officially, the Cold War ended in 1989, but
the taboo on serious discussions of capitalism’s strengths and weaknesses—
and, likewise, on serious comparisons of those with socialism’s strengths
and  weaknesses—lived on.  That  taboo  extended to  a  need  to  represent
capitalism and socialism simplistically, as if there were no major variants of
capitalism (the US version is not the same as that in Turkey, Germany,

Argentina, etc.) and likewise major variants of socialism (the USSR’s is not
the  same  as  that  in  Sweden,  China, Portugal, or  Cuba). See  further
discussions of  these  differences in  my  previous work,  “Understanding
Socialism.” One tragic result of the Cold War taboo is that today, when very
serious problems confront and threaten capitalism and also socialism, most
people lack the theory, concepts, and facts needed to discuss, understand,
and solve those problems. Had we had public discussion without mutually
hostile taboos, we would be in far better shape to solve social problems
now.
Whether you’re a critic of capitalism or one of its loyal defenders, this
chapter offers  a  set  of  basic  problems in  capitalism that  deserve our
attention now.  No  matter your  opinion of  capitalism, this  chapter will
clarify some basic issues and problems the system presents. This part of the
book  also  aims  to  help  you  understand growing anti-capitalist feelings
around the  globe  as  you  think  and  rethink your  own  opinions  about
capitalism and socialism.
We  call  the  topics  below problems of  capitalism because so  few  of
capitalism’s  champions (whether politicians, mass  media, or  academics)
admit  them.  Naming these  problems  is  a  kind  of  medicine to  cure  our
excessive distraction from facing, examining, and trying to overcome them.
Large  sections of  contemporary capitalism are  in  crisis  and  decline.
Excessive distraction now is especially unwise, undesirable, and dangerous.
## Undemocratic
Fans of capitalism like to say it is democratic or that it supports democracy.
Some have stretched so far as to literally equate capitalism with democracy,
using  the  terms  interchangeably.  No  matter how  many  times  that  is
repeated, it  is  simply  not  true  and  never  was.  Indeed, it  is  much  more
accurate to say that capitalism and democracy are opposites. To see why,
you  have  only  to  look  at  capitalism as  a  production system where
employees enter into a relationship with employers, where a few people are
the boss, and most people simply work doing what they are told to do. That
relationship is not democratic; it is autocratic.
When you cross the threshold into a workplace (a factory, an office, a
store), you  leave  whatever democracy might  exist  outside. You  enter  a

workplace from  which democracy is  excluded. Are  the  majority—the
employees—making the decisions that affect their lives? The answer is an
unambiguous no.  Whoever runs  the  enterprise in  a  capitalist system
(owner[s] or  board  of  directors) makes all  the  key  decisions: what  the
enterprise produces, what technology it uses, where production takes place,
and what to do with enterprise profits. The employees are excluded from
making those decisions but must live with the consequences, which affect
them  deeply.  The  employees must  either accept the  effects  of  their
employers’ decisions or quit their jobs to work somewhere else (most likely
organized in the same undemocratic way).
The employer is an autocrat within a capitalist enterprise, like a king in a
monarchy.  Over  the  past  few  centuries, monarchies were  largely
“overthrown” and replaced by representative, electoral “democracies.” But
kings remained. They merely changed their location and their titles. They
moved from political positions in government to economic positions inside
capitalist enterprises. Instead of kings, they are called bosses or owners or
CEOs. There they sit, atop the capitalist enterprise, exercising many king-
like powers, unaccountable to those over whom they reign.
Democracy has been kept out of capitalist enterprise for centuries. Many
other  institutions in  societies  where capitalist enterprises  prevail—
government agencies, universities and  colleges, religions, charities, and
more—are equally autocratic. Their  internal relationships often  copy  or
mirror the  employer/employee  relationship inside capitalist enterprises.
Those institutions try thereby to “function in a businesslike manner.”
The  anti-democratic organization of  capitalist firms  also  conveys to
employees that their input is not genuinely welcomed or sought by their
bosses. Employees thus  mostly resign themselves to  their  powerless
position relative to the CEO at their workplace. They also expect the same
in  their  relationships with  political leaders, the  CEOs’  counterparts in
government. Their inability to participate in running their workplaces trains
citizens to  presume and  accept the  same  in  relation to  running their
residential communities. Employers become top political officials (and vice
versa) in part because they are used to being “in charge.” Political parties
and  government bureaucracies mirror capitalist enterprises by being  run
autocratically while constantly describing themselves as democratic.
Most adults experience working at least eight hours for five or more days
per week in capitalist workplaces, under the power and authority of their

employer. The undemocratic reality of the capitalist workplace leaves its
complex, multilayered impacts on all who collaborate there, part time and
full  time.  Capitalism’s  problem with  democracy—that the  two  basically
contradict one  another—shapes many  people’s  lives.  Elon  Musk, Jeff
Bezos, and the Walton family (Walmart’s founders), along with a handful of
other major shareholders, decide how to spend hundreds of billions. The
decisions of  a  few  hundred billionaires bring  economic development,
industries, and enterprises to some regions and lead to the economic decline
of other regions. The many billions of people affected by those spending
decisions are excluded from participating in making them. Those countless
people lack the economic and social power wielded by a tiny, unelected,
obscenely wealthy minority of people. That is the opposite of democracy.
Employers as a class, often led by major shareholders and the CEOs they
enrich, also use their wealth to buy (they would prefer to say “donate” to)
political parties, candidates, and  campaigns. The  rich  have  always
understood that universal or even widespread suffrage risks a nonwealthy
majority voting to undo society’s wealth inequality. So, the rich seek control
of existing forms of democracy to make sure they do not become a real
democracy in the sense of enabling the employee majority to outvote the
employer minority.
The  enormous surpluses appropriated by  “big  business” employers—
usually corporations—allow them  to  reward their  upper-level  executives
lavishly.  These executives, technically also  “employees,” use  corporate
wealth and power to influence politics. Their goals are to reproduce the
capitalist system and thus the favors and rewards it gives them. Capitalists
and their top employees make the political system depend on their money
more than it depends on the people’s votes.
How does capitalism make the major political parties and candidates
dependent on donations from employers and the rich? Politicians need vast
sums of money to win by dominating the media as part of costly campaigns.
They find willing donors by supporting policies that benefit capitalism as a
whole, or else particular industries, regions, and enterprises. Sometimes, the
donors find the politicians. Employers hire lobbyists—people who work
full  time,  all  year  round, to  influence the  candidates that  get  elected.
Employers fund  “think tanks” to  produce and  spread reports on  every
current social issue. The purpose of those reports is to build general support

for what the funders want. In these and more ways, employers and those
they enrich shape the political system to work for them.
Most  employees  have  no  comparable wealth or  power. To  exert  real
political power requires massive organization to  activate, combine, and
mobilize employees so their numbers can add up to real strength.
That happens rarely and with great difficulty. Moreover, in the US, the
political system has been shaped over the decades to leave only two major
parties. Both of them loudly and proudly endorse and support capitalism.
They collaborate to make it very difficult for (1) any third party to gain a
foothold, and (2) for any anti-capitalist political party to emerge. The US
endlessly repeats its commitment to maximum freedom of choice for its
citizens, but it excludes political parties from that commitment. Democracy
is about “one person, one vote”—the notion that we all have an equal say in
the decisions that affect us. That is not what we have now. Going into a
voting booth once or twice a year and picking a candidate is a very different
level  of  influence than  that  of  the  Rockefeller family or  George  Soros.
When they  want  to  influence people, they  use  their  money.  That’s  not
democracy.
In  capitalism, democracy is  unacceptable because it  threatens the
unequally distributed wealth of the minority with a majority vote. With or
without formal institutions of democracy (such as elections with universal
suffrage), capitalism  undermines  genuine democracy because  employers
control production, surplus value, and that surplus value’s distributions. For
capitalism’s leaders, democracy is what they say, not what they do.
## Unequal
As  the  French economist Thomas Piketty most  recently exposed,
capitalism, across time  and  space, has  always tended to  produce ever-
greater economic inequality (see  his  book Capital in the Twenty-First
Century,  Cambridge, MA:  Harvard University Press, 2014). Oxfam, a
global charity, recently reported today’s ten richest men together have six
times more wealth than the poorest 3.1 billion people on earth. The lack of
democracy inside workplaces or enterprises is both a cause and an effect of
capitalism’s unequal distribution of income and wealth.

Of course, inequality predates capitalism. Powerful feudal lords across
Europe had blended autocracy with unequal distributions of wealth on their
manorial estates. In fact, the largest and most powerful among the lords—
the one named king—was usually also the richest. Although revolts against
monarchy eventually retired most kings and queens (one way or another),
similarly rich  dictators reemerged  inside capitalist enterprises as  major
shareholders and CEOs. Nowadays, their palaces imitate the grandeur of
kings’ castles. The fortunes of kings and top CEOs are similarly extreme
and attract the same kind of envy, adulation, and reverence. They also draw
the  same  criticism. Inequalities that  marked the  economy,  politics,  and
culture of  European feudalism reappeared in  capitalism despite the
intentions of  many  who  revolted  against feudalism. The  problem: the
employer/employee relationship is far less a break from the master/slave
and lord/serf relations of production than capitalism’s champions had hoped
for, assumed, and promised to secure mass support for their revolutions
against slavery and feudalism.
The employer/employee relationship that defines capitalism has created
staggering inequality by  allowing the  employer full  control over
production’s  surplus. In  the  past,  inequality provoked references to  rich
capitalists, variously,  as  “robber barons” or  as  “captains of  industry”
(depending on the public’s feelings about them). Today, and in this book,
they’re referred to as “the rich” or sometimes “the superrich.”
Is it true that everyone is free in a capitalist system? The answer depends
on  what  is  meant  by  “free.” Compare the  freedom of  Elon  Musk, Jeff
Bezos, or other rich capitalists with your freedom. Capitalism distributes
some  income to  you  and  some  to  Musk, Bezos, and  the  other  rich
capitalists. However, to say that capitalism makes each of you free ignores
the reality that capitalism’s unequal distribution of wealth makes you unfree
relative to Musk, Bezos, and the other rich capitalists.
Freedom was never only about keeping the government from bothering
you; it was always also about being able to act, choose, and make a life. To
call us all free, to use the same word for everyone, erases the very real
differences in our access to resources, opportunities, and choices needed for
life. Musk is free to enjoy life, going wherever he likes and doing almost
anything you could imagine. He may work but need not. The financial cost
of  anything he  might want  or  need  is  totally irrelevant for  him.  The
overwhelming majority of  Americans have  nothing remotely like  such

freedom. To say that in capitalism, all are free, like Mr. Bezos is nonsense.
His freedom depends on the resources at his disposal. You lack the freedom
to undertake all sorts of actions and choices because those resources are not
at your disposal.
The freedom of the rich is not just different; their freedom negates the
freedom of  others. Unequal income  and  wealth always provoke anxiety
among the rich. They fear the envy their wealth excites and invites. To
protect their positions as systemically privileged recipients of income and,
thus, accumulators of wealth, the rich seek to control both political and
cultural institutions. Their goal is to shape politics and culture, to make
them celebrate and justify income and wealth inequalities, not to challenge
them. Having already discussed politics, we turn now to how the rich shape
culture to their benefit.
Unequal access to culture is a feature of capitalism. Culture concerns
how  people  think  about  all  aspects  of  life—how we  learn,  make, and
communicate meanings about the world. Our culture shapes what we find
acceptable, what we enjoy, and what we come to decide needs changing. In
European feudalism, access to culture for most serfs was shaped chiefly by
what  the  church taught. In  turn,  the  church carefully structured its
interpretation of  the  Bible  and  other  texts  to  reinforce feudal  rules  and
traditions. Lords and serfs funded the church to complete the system. In
modern capitalism, secular public schools undertake formal education
alongside or instead of churches and other private schools. In today’s world,
school education celebrates and  reinforces capitalism. In  turn,  the  state
taxes  employers and  mostly employees to  fund  public schools and
subsidizes private schools (which also  charge  students). Writers  like
Howard Zinn and Leo Huberman have penned histories of the US showing
that  much  of  what  standard school US  history  textbooks lacked were
accounts of the many class struggles against capitalism. Instead, rags-to-
riches stories about people like  Horatio Alger were  popularized.
Examinations of the roots of revolt and rebellion against low wages, bad
working conditions, and all manner of hardship imposed on the workers of
America, however, were not.
In  capitalism, mainstream media  sources are  themselves  mostly
organized as capitalist enterprises. They depend on, understand, and support
profit maximization as the driving force of their enterprises. Their CEOs
can and do make all sorts of definitive decisions about what is aired, how

events are interpreted, whose careers blossom, and whose end. CEOs hire
and  fire,  promote and  demote. On  mainstream radio, TV,  and  film,  we
almost never see exciting dramas about anti-capitalist revolutionaries who
win the day by successfully persuading employees to join them. Rags-to-
capitalist-riches dramas are, in comparison, routine storylines in countless
mainstream media productions.
In  capitalism, culture is  constrained to  reinforce that  system. Even
individuals who privately criticize capitalism learn early in their careers to
keep such criticisms private. Periodically, ideological battles can and do
break out. If and when they coalesce with anti-capitalist upsurges elsewhere
in society, cultural criticism of capitalism has been, and can again be, a
powerful revolutionary force for systemic change. That is why defenders of
the capitalist system instinctually and ceaselessly shape politics, economics,
and culture to reinforce it.
Capitalism has often undermined democracy and equality, because doing
so has reinforced and actually strengthened the capitalist organization of the
economy.  As  an  example of  capitalism’s  corruption of  democracy and
equality, we consider the mid-American town of Kalamazoo, Michigan.
As in so many other US cities, Kalamazoo’s corporations and its rich
have used their wealth and power to become richer and more powerful. By
donating to politicians, threatening to take their businesses elsewhere, and
hiring better lawyers than the city could afford, the rich reduced the amount
of taxes they needed to pay to the local government. The rich funded costly,
broadly targeted anti-tax campaigns that found a receptive audience among
the already-overtaxed average citizens. Once deprived of the tax revenue
from the rich, local politicians either (1) shifted more of the tax burden onto
average citizens, (2)  cut  public services in  the  short  run,  and/or (3)
borrowed money and thereby risked having to cut public services in the
longer run to service city debts. Among those they borrowed from were
sometimes the  same  corporations and  the  rich  whose taxes  had  been
reduced after they funded successful anti-tax campaigns.
Eventually, the city saw an accumulation of resident complaints about
steadily cut  public services (uncollected garbage, neglected  streets,
deteriorated schools, etc.), alongside rising taxes and government fees. This
litany is familiar in many US cities. Eventually, upper- and middle-income
residents started to leave. That worsened the existing set of problems, so
even  more  people left.  Then,  two  of  Kalamazoo’s  wealthiest and  most

powerful capitalists—William Parfet and William Johnston—developed a
solution they promoted to “save our city.” Parfet and Johnston established
the  “Foundation for  Excellence in  Kalamazoo.” They contributed,
according to reports, over $25 million annually to it. Since such foundations
usually qualify for tax-exempt status at federal, state, and local levels of
government, the two gentlemen’s contributions lowered their personal tax
bills. More  importantly,  the  two  could wield outsize local  political
influence. They would have much to say about how much their foundation
funded which public services in Kalamazoo. In this city, the old democratic
notion of everyone paying taxes to share in funding the public well-being
was  replaced by  private charity.  Public, reasonably transparent
accountability was  replaced by  the  less  transparent, murkier foundation
activities. Public accountability faded  as  the  private whims of  private
foundations took over.
What  used  to  be  called  a  “company town” (when a  major  employer
substituted its rule for any democratic town rule) often amounted, in the
words of PBS, to “slavery by another name.” In their modern form, they
appear as  “foundation cities.” Old  company towns  were  rejected nearly
everywhere across US history. But, as the Kalamazoo example shows, they
have returned with names changed.
While capitalism’s general tendency is toward ever-greater inequality,
occasional redistributions of wealth have happened. These moments have
come to be called “reforms” and include progressive taxation of income and
wealth, welfare entitlements, and minimum wage legislation. Redistributive
reforms usually occur when middle-income and poor people stop tolerating
deepening inequality.  The  biggest  and  most  important example in US
history was the Great Depression of the 1930s. The New Deal policies of
the federal government then drastically reduced the inequality of wealth and
income distribution. Yet employers and the rich have never ceased their
opposition to new redistributions and their efforts to undo old ones. US
politicians learn early in their careers what results when they advocate for
redistributive reforms: an  avalanche of  criticism coupled with  shifts  of
donors to their political opponents. Thus, in the US, after the end of World
War  II  in  1945,  the  employer class  changed the  policies of  the  federal
government. Over the past eighty years, most of what the New Deal won
was undone.

Corporations and the rich hire accountants skilled in hiding money in
foreign and  domestic places that  evade reporting to  the US  Internal
Revenue Service. Called “tax havens,” those hiding places keep funds that
remain untouched by tax collectors. In 2013, Oxfam published findings that
the trillions stashed away in tax havens could end extreme world poverty—
twice over. Yet since the revelation of this shocking statistic, the inequality
of wealth and income has become more extreme in nearly every nation on
earth. Tax havens persist.
Conflicts over income, wealth distribution, and its redistribution are thus
intrinsic to capitalism and always have been. Occasionally they become
violent and  socially disruptive.  They  may  trigger demands for  system
change. They may function as catalysts for revolutions.
No  “solution” to  struggles over  income and  wealth redistribution in
capitalism was ever found. The reason for that is a system that increasingly
enriches a small group. The logical response—proposing that income and
wealth be distributed more equally in the first place—was usually taboo. It
was thus largely ignored. The French revolutionaries of l789, who promised
“liberty,  equality,  and  fraternity” with  the  transition from  feudalism to
capitalism, failed. They got that transition, but not equality. Marx explained
the failure to achieve the promised equality resulted from capitalism’s core
structure of employer and employee preventing equality. In Marx’s view,
inequality is inseparable from capitalism and will persist until the transition
to another system.
## Unstable
Throughout its history, capitalism has been remarkably unstable. As the
National Bureau of Economic Research found, every four to seven years on
average, capitalism  crashes. Alternative terms for  “crash” include
“recession,” “depression,” “cyclical  downturn,” “crisis,” “bubble  burst,”
and  more. Sometimes, these  sudden downturns in  productive activity,
employment, and investment are short and shallow. Sometimes, they last
many years and hurt the economy badly. Three of the worst were the Great
Depression of the 1930s, the so-called Great Recession of 2008–2009, and
the 2020 crash aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Capitalism’s  instability disrupts  millions of  households, relationships,
careers, educations, and dreams. The downturns cut the tax revenues that
enable all levels of government to function—and just when government
help is most urgently needed. Capitalist crashes cause normal maintenance
of homes, cars, workplaces, and public infrastructure to be neglected or
postponed. Unemployed workers use  up  savings. Rates  of  alcoholism,
divorce, and  abuse  of  family members rise—as do  physical and  mental
health problems in general. Capitalism’s instability incurs huge social costs.
The scars on lives left by capitalism’s constant cyclical downturns run deep.
Capitalism’s fan clubs often blame its instability on “outside” forces:
natural disasters such as floods, droughts, viral pandemics, or government
policies, including wars. The system’s fans also often justify crashes as the
way  capitalism weeds out  ineffective, inefficient producers from  the
otherwise healthy and  thriving mass  of  capitalist enterprises. Political
economist Joseph Schumpeter famously admitted that capitalism regularly
destroyed jobs,  inventories, and  whole businesses, but  he  characterized
those  capitalist crashes as  moments of  “creative destruction.” They
established the  conditions necessary for  the  next  upswing of  capitalist
production and growth.
For most of capitalism’s history, crashes were widely accepted as almost
“natural” cycles. Capitalists consoled themselves as  Schumpeter did:  by
focusing on  the  light they  perceived at  the  end  of  the  tunnel of
unemployment and bankruptcies. Eventually, they realized, the unemployed
become sufficiently desperate to take jobs that offered lower wages than
they otherwise would have accepted. Bankrupt employers lower their prices
far enough to secure buyers in depressed markets. Landlords lower rents to
factory, office, and store tenants. Lawyers and accountants lower their fees.
As all these costs of doing business thus decline, eventually they fall far
enough to make production profitable again. Falling wages and prices may
incentivize renewed investment in production. The economic downturn can
thus turn itself into an upturn.
The real problem lay with eventually: how long would it take each time
for a downturn to produce an upturn? How long would the employee class
tolerate that  unemployment? Where would the  resultant  suffering,
frustration, and waiting move that class politically? Economic depressions
could lead the victims of capitalism’s crashes to make common cause with
the  system’s  critics. By  the  nineteenth century,  as  labor  unions, social

movements, and socialist parties grew, their alliances posed serious political
risks to the employer class.
Team  capitalism  usually splits  over  how  best  to  manage system
instability. One side feels confident that employees will be disciplined by
periodic crashes.  Fearing “hard times” and  the  damage they  inflict,
employees will be vulnerable to claims that “we all must go through hard
times  together,  making some  sacrifices.” Corporate and  political leaders
will  blame external events but  never  the  capitalist system itself.  Such
external events could  be  wars,  bad  government policies/politicians, or
natural events like droughts, storms, and pandemics. The crucial point was
that the crash was never the employers’ fault; they were represented as
victims alongside employees.
Capitalism’s advocates usually want to keep the government from any
direct intervention in the core relationship of employer to employee. For
them, capitalism’s instability must not open the door to such interventions.
They fear that employees might then consider using state power to reduce
inequality or  even  proceed to  abolish that  core  relationship in  favor  of
another.
Capitalism’s defenders repeatedly rediscover the “laissez-faire” instinct.
Early capitalists had a very strong bias against the state as an existential
threat  because capitalism was  born  out  of,  and  against the  repressive
hostility of, the absolute monarchies of late feudal Europe. They wanted the
state  to  leave  capitalists and  the  capitalist system alone  (laissez faire
roughly translates as “let it be”). Those early prejudices against the state
reappear in later protests against unwanted government interference in the
“private market and  economy.”  For  them,  the  appropriate response to
economic crises is an insistence that state intervention is unnecessary and
only  makes economic matters  worse. The  modern proponents of this
approach include, among many others, Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises,
and Milton Friedman.
However, the other side among employers and defenders of capitalism
fears that capitalist crashes may cut deeply and last long enough to provoke
a turn of the employee class toward socialism. They argue that capitalism’s
downturns can  and  should be  mitigated and  that  the  government  is  the
necessary agent  to  accomplish  that.  Thus,  in  the  midst  of  the  Great
Depression of  the  1930s, an  English economist, John  Maynard Keynes,
showed how  to  identify emerging  crises, understand their  causes and

workings, and  shape government interventions that  could prevent,
moderate, or shorten economic downturns.
In Keynes’s view, the key government interventions were of two kinds.
The first focused on the monetary system: monetary policies shaped the
quantity of money in circulation, the terms on which money was borrowed
and lent, the interest rate. The second focused on the government’s budget,
using its taxing and spending activities as a means to prevent, moderate, or
shorten economic downturns. “Fiscal policies” referred to those government
taxation and spending actions aimed at capitalism’s instability problem.
Over  the  last  century,  capitalist economies have  repeatedly struggled
through cyclical crises. Their leaders and economic advisors have debated
and  then  applied what  came  to  be  called either “laissez-faire”  or
“Keynesian” policies. Some have tried combinations of the two. Those who
hoped that  such  policies might end  capitalism’s  instability were
disappointed. That instability persists. The crashes of 2008–2009 and 2020–
2021  proved  that.  Indeed, those  last  two  number among the  worst  in
capitalism’s history.
Beyond that, the supporters of Keynesianism insist that the application
of their policies has, at least sometimes, rendered downturns shallower and
shorter than they would have been without those policies. Proponents of
laissez-faire make similar claims about times when governments did little
or nothing in the face of cyclical downturns. As these two sides debate, the
cyclical downturns continue to appear and scar the lives of millions around
the globe. In trying merely to “manage” these recessions, the economics
profession distracts itself and its audiences from wrestling with the much
larger  issue.  Since  instability has  shown itself  to  be  systemic, system
changes are  among the  logical solutions that  ought  to  be  considered,
discussed, and debated.
For the last few years, reliance on Keynesian policies has increased with
the size of economies and their crashes. One in particular—manipulation of
the  quantity of  money in  circulation—became more  important partly
because the spread of modern monetary theory (MMT) reduced hesitancy to
use this policy (even by the establishment that mostly rejected much of that
theory). Huge fiscal deficits were repeatedly monetized as central banks
printed money (or created it electronically) to buy government debt as fast
as it was created. Government debt thus mushroomed by trillions of dollars
annually. At the same time, capitalist downturns starting in 2000 provoked

the application of the Keynesian monetary policy of dropping interest rates
to record lows, at or even sometimes below 0 percent annually. The results
of  capitalism’s  instability thus  include huge,  historically unprecedented
levels  of  government debt  but  also,  in  part  because of  extremely low
interest rates, massive run-ups in corporate and household debt.
In  2000, the US  national debt—the federal government’s  debt
accumulated across US history—stood at $5.7 trillion, or 55 percent of US
GDP that year. By 2022, the national debt had risen to $30 trillion, or 130
percent of  GDP  that  year.  That  stunning increase in  government
indebtedness benefited creditors that included US and foreign government
agencies, large corporations, and (mostly) wealthy individuals. What those
corporations and individuals save from low taxes, they turn around and lend
to the government.
US indebtedness to foreign creditors makes it the world’s single largest
debtor nation. When interest rates rise (as market phenomena and/or anti-
inflationary policy tools), servicing the national debt becomes increasingly
costly for the government. Rising government debt levels and rising debt-
servicing costs are major drags on the federal budget. Those drags are yet
more costs of capitalism’s instability.
Instability and debt in US history
For the roughly 150 years before the 1970s, the white American working
class had experienced decade after decade of rising real wages. Prices also
went up in that time, but wages rose even more. Rising labor productivity
made that possible because it also delivered rising profits to capitalists.
Because working-class families could afford steadily rising consumption,
the period of the 1820s to the 1970s provided most US workers the best-
rising  standard of  living  among  all  capitalist economies. They  came  to
believe that they lived in a uniquely charmed country. For the religious, it
was proof God favored the United States. For others, it was proof that
capitalism was  the  “best” economic system. Celebrations of  American
exceptionalism blunted the  appeals of  socialism and  other  criticisms of
capitalism.
The  long  period of  rising  real  wages stopped in  the  1970s. The US
working class was stunned, perhaps even traumatized. But by that time,
socialist movements and impulses in the US had largely been destroyed by

McCarthyism and the Cold War. Working-class families were left without
explanations or criticisms of how and why US capitalism stopped raising
real wages. Those families thus blamed themselves rather than a system that
had  ceased working for  them.  They  struggled all  the  more  to  maintain
consumption levels—the size of the house, the number of cars, and the vast
array of consumer goods—despite stagnant real wages.
To that end, more members of working-class families entered the paid
workforce: primarily women, and secondarily the elderly and teenagers.
Family members who were already employed took on more hours of work
or a second or third job. American working-class families also used up
savings and violated old traditions of thrift and saving money. Pressed also
by enormous promotion from the banks, they shouldered rising debt.
The banks hawked “consumer services” consisting of credit cards and
direct loans, profitably mining the working-class desire for “the American
dream” of a steadily rising standard of living. Since their real wages had
stopped rising, they  had  to  borrow to  realize that  dream. Once  again,
capitalism found new ways to profit and old ways not to grasp their costs:
huge new household debt levels risking bigger crashes, costly bailouts, and
so on. That is how capitalism works. We are living through the realization
of those risks now.
In this new economic context, when profiteering lenders increasingly
pushed mortgages (loans for  purchasing a  home) onto  low-income
(“subprime”) people in the years before 2008, they set the stage for yet
another capitalist crash. It arrived when deteriorating economic conditions
undermined many people’s ability to make the monthly payments on their
mortgage debt. Profiteering mortgage lenders lost revenues, so they, in turn,
defaulted to the banks and others from whom they had borrowed. Investors
who speculated in securities backed by mortgage loans saw their values
collapse. Defaults spread across the  entire  credit  system, wrecking the
financial positions of  borrowers and  lenders alike. Many financial
instruments (especially credit default swaps) had been created on the basis,
ultimately,  of  underlying mortgages. The  ramifying default  triggered
financial panic and a major crash we’ve come to call “the Great Recession”
or “the financial meltdown.”
Besides the mortgage crisis in 2008, we’ve had two other downturns in
the last twenty years: the dot-com in 2000 and the COVID-19 in 2020. In
each of those crises, the desperate anxiety of the government was that the

financial panic would deepen into a general economic downturn. In each
case, the government directed the United States central bank, the Federal
Reserve, to cut interest rates nearly to zero. That made money extremely
cheap to borrow. The Federal Reserve lent it to the banks, and the banks
lent it to the corporations. This was supposed to stimulate borrowing and
flood the economy with cheap money. The Fed hoped that businesses would
borrow and produce more by hiring more. That would then prevent, or at
least reduce, the risk of a general collapse. In any case, after 2000, the total
debt of nonfinancial corporations soared to record levels.
What happens if prolonged economic crises occur and make it difficult
for corporations to pay back loans? Typically, they fire people. The money
no longer needed for wages of fired workers becomes available instead to
pay off debts.
Such tragedies do not occur because capitalists are cruel but because the
system works that way. Capitalism gives a tiny group of people—employers
—the means and the profit incentive to squeeze workers’ wages, get them
into debt, and then penalize or bankrupt them when they cannot pay off the
debt.  Capitalism thus  widens  the  inequality of  wealth and  income,
redistributing them from those who can afford it least to those who already
have it. No wonder capitalism’s critics view such a system as unjust.
Another element of corporate debt demonstrates capitalism’s unstable
nature. Zombie corporations are capitalist enterprises whose profits are not
enough to pay the interest on their debt. Technically, such businesses are
bankrupt—they cannot cover their obligations. To avoid collapse, zombie
corporations borrow more money, using it to pay off the interest on their
older debts. Of course, then they’ll be in even deeper trouble because they
now have even more interest to pay on the extra borrowing. Nearly one out
of five capitalist corporations in America is in zombie territory. Why did
this happen, and what does it mean? This takes us back to the Federal
Reserve. It has so far responded to the crises of the twenty-first century by
making money available at  close  to  zero  interest rates  for  many  years.
Corporations thus found that borrowing nearly costless money was often
the cheapest, easiest, and quickest way of dealing with business problems.
Alternative solutions (such as  changing their  product mix  or  their
technology,  retraining workers, relocating production, etc.)  were  less
attractive.

Textbook capitalism is not supposed to work this way. If a company
cannot cover its expenses, that company’s existence should be questioned.
Capital should move to another company that is profitable or at least less of
a zombie. But if a stagnant company can easily borrow to cover its costs, its
continuance slows down the larger economy’s growth. If zombies’ debts
become enormous relative to  their  underlying businesses, their  creditors
may  balk  at  further  loans. Creditors fear  that  zombies might declare
bankruptcy and never repay accumulated loans. No creditor wants to be
stung like that. Some may pull back early to avoid the risk of being late.
Bankruptcies dump cascading effects on everyone connected to the doomed
zombie.
An otherwise-modest economic downturn of the sort that often afflict
capitalism can  turn  into  a  major  crash  if  it  drives enough  zombie
corporations over the edge into bankruptcy. Capitalism’s vulnerability to the
zombie risk reflects the system’s internal mechanisms that create and enable
zombies in the first place. Capitalism’s instability is inherent.
Reactions to instability
Capitalism has  so  far  failed  to  bring  an  end  to  its  inherent  economic
instability. Its periodic cycles create deep insecurities among the system’s
people and  leaders. The  system’s  ups  and  downs—in unemployment,
income, inflation,  and  government responses to  them—shake and
sometimes destabilize whole societies. Sooner or later, workers grasp they
could lose their jobs, wages, and living situations in one of those recessions
that happen on average every four to seven years. When workers understand
this as the systemic instability of capitalism, they change from mere victims
into critics of the system. Thus, capitalists and their protectors have always
needed ways to deflect mass anxieties, protests, and the risks that workers
might mobilize to leave capitalism behind altogether.
One way US capitalists found entailed using racism to exempt a majority
of workers from the system’s instability. US capitalists could secure most
white workers’ jobs even during economic downturns by imposing much
more unemployment on the African American minority. The latter were last
hired and first fired. They were effectively assigned the social function of
disproportionately absorbing economic downturns. As “shock absorbers”
for  capitalism’s  recessions, African Americans were  most  damagingly

impacted by capitalism’s cycles. White Americans’ jobs and lives were thus
disrupted far less often. Racism functions to prevent seeing unemployed
African Americans as capitalism’s victims.
Racists are  those  who  came  to  believe that  African Americans are
unemployed more  because they  are  somehow inherently less  productive
than their white counterparts. Thus, in their view, capitalism is not the cause
of  unemployment; rather,  race  renders African American workers
unemployable. Capitalism’s defenders claim that Black workers are paid
less, fired more often, and denied credit more often because their work is
less  valuable, their  creditworthiness is  poor,  and  so  on—all as  racial
characteristics.
The employment shocks imposed by capitalism’s instability on white
Americans are basically fewer in number, lesser in frequency, and shorter in
duration than  those  imposed on  African Americans. An  old  adage
summarizes this: “When America gets a cold, the Black community gets the
flu.”  This  adage  often  extends to  other  social  groups as  well—such as
women, Hispanic Americans, and Indigenous Americans. White people get
relative security from  the  ravages of  the  system’s  instability because it
distributes those  ravages unequally across the  working class. That
inequality is  then  justified in  racist, sexist, and  parallel modes of
discrimination that  blame the  victims. The  well-known  statistical
inequalities between African Americans and white Americans (in terms of
income, wealth,  savings, homeownership, geographic stability,  political
participation, etc.)  flow  directly from  their  different relationships to
capitalism’s  instability.  Not  surprisingly,  white  Americans have  greater
sympathy for capitalism.
Handling capitalism’s instability in such discriminatory ways has social
effects. In the US, white men traditionally save more and more easily than
others. They get promoted sooner and further, can afford better homes, cars,
and clothes, and can more easily obtain bank loans. In such a stratified
system, differences among social groups deepen over time, and with them
all  sorts  of  anxieties, fears,  and  resentments. Racial and  gender-based
tensions can worsen, especially if people believe intrinsic differences cause
and  explain  different  positions  in  the  economy rather  than  seeing how
systemic economic  problems—like instability—contribute to  turning
differences into inequalities and tensions. Capitalist instability has a clear
role in and responsibility for its contributions to racial and gender hostilities

and discriminations in capitalist societies (a topic explored in greater depth
below, in “The Relationships of Capitalism: Capitalism and Racism”).
Capitalist instability can become so extreme that it provokes profound
and sometimes also violent social changes. The worst, deepest, and longest-
lasting cyclical downturn in capitalism’s history to date—dubbed the Great
Depression—lasted from  1929  to  the  early  1940s. So  severe was
unemployment in 1933 that one in every four US workers was jobless, and
around the world, millions moved closer to destitution than ever before.
They demanded to know what had brought them to this tragic situation.
In Germany, the Great Depression (1929) hit after the loss of World War
I (1918) and a period of mega-inflation (1923) that had wiped out most
Germans’ life savings. “Why?” was the question of the day. Socialists and
communists blamed capitalism, and their ideas generated a large following.
At the other end of the political spectrum, politicians like Adolf Hitler built
their Nazi Party by blaming Jews and other “bad people,” framing them as
evil “races” who had somehow ruined Germany. Hitler and the Nazis he led
promised to fix the situation. If given government power, they would merge
their Nazi Party with the leaders and owners of Germany’s major capitalist
industries to form a kind of private-state partnership capitalism. Such a
merger is a core part of what “fascism” means. German fascism promised it
would create jobs in the workplaces it ran with no interference allowed
from unions or any other social institutions. Nazis would (and did) destroy
all  left-wing social movements and  organizations. Workers and  their
families could join  only  fascist organizations. The  Nazis banned or
destroyed all  other  social organizations and  communities (including
independent unions, church groups, civic  associations, political parties,
cultural groups).
Hitler justified such repression as necessary to enable fascism to make
Germany a  great  empire again.  He  likewise required the  persecution,
imprisonment, and eventually the murder of millions of Jewish people and
other groups relentlessly portrayed as enemies of or obstacles to making
Germany great again. Fascism, which repeatedly led to such horrors, has
been one response to capitalism’s instability. (For more on this topic, see
“The Relationships of Capitalism: Capitalism and Fascism” below.)
In  the  US,  the  crash  and  Great  Depression provoked a  few  fascist
movements but, much more prominently, also a major political shift to the
left. Where Nazi fascists arrested and assassinated unionists, socialists, and

communists in  Germany,  the  American government of  Franklin D.
Roosevelt worked with existing unions and their leaders, as well as socialist
and communist parries. These differences in reactions to capitalism’s great
crash culminated in World War II, where the US allied with the Soviet
Union to  defeat Hitler,  Benito  Mussolini, and  their  jointly championed
fascism.
Sometimes called “state  capitalism of  the  left,”  FDR’s  response to
capitalism’s great crash entailed a huge increase in the size and range of
government interference in  the  private sector.  Laissez-faire was  brushed
aside  as  policy and  replaced by  what  might also  be called “extreme
Keynesianism.” Washington regulated the  capitalist economy  by  such
measures as  mandating a  legal  minimum wage, raising  taxes  on
corporations and  the  rich  by  record amounts, imposing regulations on
markets, substituting state-run rationing for  markets in  a  long  list  of
commodities, and establishing a state pension system (Social Security), a
state unemployment compensation program, and more.
Capitalism’s  Great  Depression weakened the  forces favoring laissez-
faire government policies inherited from capitalism’s pre-crash past. At the
same time, that depression strengthened support for Keynesian economics
in the US and globally. To many people, what Keynes advocated for and
what  the  Soviet Union had  already established—despite many other
differences between them—were kinds of state capitalist economies that
had much in common. It is thus no wonder that pro-laissez-faire lovers of
capitalism used  the  epithet of  “socialism” simplistically to  label
Keynesianism as  somehow connected, Cold  War  style,  to  a  demonized
Soviet Union. Of  course, Keynesianism—like capitalism, socialism, and
most other large social movements and institutions—takes multiple forms
that vary from one another. Differing social and historical contexts shape
how theories and practices get interpreted, applied, and adjusted in different
places and times. Keynesian economic policy differs from one nation to the
next.  Similarly,  Saudi  Arabian capitalism today  is  different from US
capitalism. Swedish socialism is  different from  Soviet socialism. The
Keynesian economic policies that Hider used are different from those FDR
used or those many current leaders use. Intense debates among capitalism’s
defenders have  always reflected, underscored, and  often  deepened their
different understandings of economics and their different interpretations of

theories and  policies. The  same  applies to  debates among advocates of
socialism.
Capitalism’s cyclical crashes have provoked debates over how best to
prevent or  overcome them.  From  capitalism’s  inception, that  instability
often victimized people, some of whom became system critics. Some went
further,  organizing social  movements opposed to  capitalism’s  particular
distributions of wealth, its interactions with the natural environment, its
extensions into  colonialism, and  countless other  issues. Others targeted
particular forms  of  capitalism (such  as laissez-faire  or  Keynesian state
capitalism). Still others went beyond which aspects and forms of capitalism
to favor, fighting instead for a social transition to a fundamentally new
system. In these debates, discussions, and conflicts, words like “socialist”
and “capitalist” took on multiple, different, and evolving meanings. Today’s
many concepts of capitalism and socialism are products of capitalism and
its critics.
In conclusion, if you lived with a roommate as unstable as the capitalist
system, you would probably have moved out long ago.
## Inefficient
To  ask,  “Is  capitalism efficient?” is  immediately to  run  into  trouble.
Answers will vary depending on how “efficient” is understood/defined—
whether in terms of an employer seeking profit, a consumer seeking utility,
or a worker seeking a high standard of living. Or might it be the efficiency
of capitalism in providing adequate housing, food, water, and health care to
all humanity? Is it efficient in addressing the climate change process that
threatens billions of lives? Is capitalism efficient in some ways and not in
others?
The fact is that efficiency is a problematic, inadequate, and downright
misleading concept to  begin  with.  Moreover,  it  uses  similarly deficient
measurements. Yet  it  is  often  linked closely to  capitalism, because its
supporters lean heavily on “efficiency” to justify its existence, effects, and
alleged superiority to other economic systems.
In the usual, rough definition used by economists, what happens in an
economy—any act  or  event  such  as  hiring an  employee, lowering an
interest rate, raising prices, or investing in a factory expansion—is efficient

if  its  total  positive consequences (“benefits”) exceed its  total  negative
consequences (“costs”). Thus economists measure costs and benefits to see
which is  larger.  If  total  costs  exceed total  benefits, the  act  or  event  is
deemed inefficient and  should  not  happen. If  measurements yield  the
reverse, then the act or event is efficient and should happen. To choose
among any two or more events that all have net-positive benefits, the most
efficient event is the one with the most benefits compared to its costs.
From the point of view of capitalists, entering a business venture is an
act that entails costs (for rent, inputs, wages, etc.), which are its negatives,
while the revenues such a business receives are its positives. The larger the
excess of  total  revenues over  total  costs—that is,  profits—the more
“efficient” it would be to start that business. Once the business is underway,
the same comparison of its total costs and revenues (measured in profits)
will determine whether it is an efficient or inefficient business. And the
same approach would determine the efficiency (or not) of a decision to sell
or close the business.
For  centuries, this  simple definition crucially supported claims by
cheerleaders of  capitalism that  it  is  an  efficient system. Businesses are
established, function, and grow only if and when their business decisions
(acts)  are  generally profitable:  when  their  benefits exceed their  costs.
Proponents of capitalism have often extended this efficiency calculus to all
individuals and the decisions they make. They claim each person decides to
pursue an education or take a job based on making a cost-benefit analysis.
Thus, to  the  extent that  the  profit motive governs enterprises,
capitalism’s defenders declare it to be the model efficient economic system.
Any interference in economic affairs by employees, the state, or any other
institution or social force imposing any decision-making rules other than
profit-seeking is  denounced. Such interferences impose economic
inefficiency on the society in which they occur. It follows, for capitalism’s
defenders, that any economic system that rejects profit as the standard for
economic activities will  be  less  efficient than  capitalism. Equating
capitalism’s  maximization of  profit  with  economic efficiency is  a  key
defense for capitalism.
Critics have  long  argued  that  capitalism’s  profits flow  to  employers
alone: a  minority relative to  the  employees, who  are  usually  the  vast
majority within businesses. Profit maximization rewards a minority of those
engaged in  capitalist enterprises.  As  explained earlier,  profit-seeking

capitalist employers usually seek to “save on labor costs” and so tend to
lower employees’ share of output. Capitalism’s profit drive, then, benefits
employers at the expense of employees. Such politically effective critiques
of  capitalism  might  be  refuted if  equating profit  maximization with
efficiency held any water. Unfortunately for capitalism, it does not.
To see through this defense, let’s look straight at what efficiency is. It
claims to list and then to measure all positive and all negative consequences
of some act or event, and to compare them. But if you stop to think about it,
that is, in reality, absolutely impossible to do.
For any act or event, the very idea of cause and effect turns out to be
very  problematic. For  each  item  on  a  list  of  positive versus negative
consequences, the question must be asked: Is it a consequence of only the
one act whose efficiency we are trying to establish? Might several, many, or
an infinity of factors cause the consequences on any such list? If so, we
cannot link any one effect to any one cause. The event whose efficiency we
want to calculate did not alone cause the good or bad outcome; it alone is
not responsible for either the benefits or costs. Stated another way, costs
and benefits are results of many factors, never of just one. And if every act
has many consequences, each of which has many causes, then measuring
efficiency of a particular enterprise, event, or action has no meaning. There
are more problems with “efficiency.” Many consequences of any act or
event  whose  efficiency we  want  to  assess will  not  materialize  until  the
future; such consequences cannot be measured now. We cannot know now
whether they are positive or negative or by how much. The list of impacts
flowing from  any  act  or  event  is  likely  very  long.  It  will  take  time  to
measure them all, yet we need an efficiency calculation now. Moreover,
those impacts are different, affecting the economy but also politics, nature,
culture, and so on. How do we reduce qualitatively different consequences
to a single monetary value so we can compare more and less, benefits and
costs? There is no one or right way to do that, and there never was. It turns
out that measuring efficiency in the cost-benefit sense is impossible.
Consider, for example, producing and selling a cup of yogurt. Is that an
efficient thing  to  do?  An  efficiency analysis would have  us  weigh its
positive impacts (like the consumer’s pleasure, the seller’s profit, and so on)
against its negative impacts (like the resources used up in maintaining cow
herds, or in producing, shipping, and refrigerating yogurt). But hold on. The
impacts should also include long-term effects. How will yogurt bacteria

interact with human gut bacteria over the long run, shaping consumers’
health? What is the cost of medical care for those health effects? What
about the disruptions to climate associated with the cow herd’s methane gas
releases? Such lists go on forever.
The fact is that no one has the time, resources, or ability to list all the
possible impacts across all of space and time, let alone to measure them in
some  comparable, quantitative way.  Yet,  to  get  a  “correct” efficiency
statement, we would have to add up positive and negative impacts to get
two numbers—total costs versus total benefits. When you consider their
limited focus,  you  can  clearly see  that  all  efficiency claims to  date  are
inaccurate, because they could not and did not do what would be necessary
for a complete evaluation.
One might legitimately wonder whether anyone ever took the time and
spent the money needed to make such immense lists and calculations—and
also  honestly admitted the  many  unknowns entailed in  them—before
deciding whether an act or event should take place. Is efficiency, then, just a
fanciful idea made up so it can be claimed and accepted for some purpose,
such as justifying capitalism?
Efficiency calculations happen all around us every day. People use them
to justify decisions and acts of all kinds. But those calculations could only
ever list and measure a very partial, incomplete list of costs and benefits.
Actual efficiency evaluations tell us more about the selection biases of the
evaluators than about their object’s efficiency. The evaluators had to select
what they could measure while ignoring or denying the rest but admitting
that was and is rare because doing so renders the efficiency claim null and
void. That, too, is the result of acknowledging that any act’s or event’s costs
and benefits are never the results only of that act or event. Efficiency is a
mirage.
When capitalists  (or  those  they  hire)  count  costs  and  benefits,  they
bother to count only those costs for which they actually must pay and only
those benefits that accrue to them as revenue. Those are never all of the
costs  and  benefits. Consider,  for  example, a  capitalist whose factory
smokestacks belch pollutants into the air. The smokestacks intoxicate the
air, water, and soil around the factory, incurring all manner of short- and
long-term health costs like asthma, cancer, and a variety of diseases for
factory employees and people living in the area. Only rarely do the factory-
owning capitalists have to pay those costs, so they are not counted when

evaluating such a factory’s operation. The same applies to benefits that are
not profits for the calculating capitalists. Economists refer to such costs and
benefits as  “external” or  “externalities”—which really  only  means that
those costs and benefits are not usually counted. Let’s take the example of
this event: a worker is fired. Capitalists fire workers when it isn’t profitable
to keep them. Every honest capitalist will tell you that. When an employer
fires a worker, the employer loses the output that the worker’s effort helped
produce for the employer to sell. The employer gets fewer widgets than that
worker helped to make, or perhaps a lower quality or quantity of a service
that the worker produced for the employer to sell. The employer’s loss is
the cost. The employer’s benefit is not having to pay the fired worker any
wage. If the wage is greater than the value the worker’s labor produced, it
advantages the employer to fire the worker. For the employer, the only cost
that matters is the lost output of the fired worker.
But the same is definitely not true for the larger society. We know the
many  real  costs  of  unemployment.  Alcoholism, divorce, and  abuse  in
families all  rise  during unemployment. They  require medical care,
psychological attention, and  police activity; those  all  cost  money.  The
employer is exempted from paying those costs, but others have to, and do.
Society pays all the real costs of unemployment. The employer pays for
only a small part of those costs. Yet the employer makes the decision to fire.
It is efficient for the employer but extremely inefficient for the society as a
whole. Keeping the fired worker on the job and paying a wage is far less
costly than what unemployment costs, if and when all the associated costs
are considered. The social cost of unemployment exceeds the private cost to
the employer, but capitalism allows private employers to decide whether or
not to fire. Externalities provide yet another reason to dismiss efficiency
claims as bases for defending capitalism.
Worse, externalities show us that social costs are borne by all of us while
profits accrue  only  to  capitalists. That  is  both  undemocratic and  unfair.
Efficiency is  an  empty concept.  It  cannot rationally demonstrate that
capitalism is  superior to  socialism or  vice  versa.  To  say  something is
efficient, or more efficient than something else, is the modern equivalent of
what ancient people insisted was God’s will. To say something was God’s
will  was  their  attempt to  end  debate, disagreement, and  dispute by
appealing to something above our human differences, something absolute
that all must recognize as decisive and definite. Eventually, most people

became skeptical about anyone’s claim to know what God’s will was. When
will people stop accepting the comparable claims about efficiency?
It is a bit easier nowadays to mock the idea of efficiency because widely
held  common sense  recognizes  its  limits  and  problems. The  ecological
movement has taught this generation that capitalists never counted many of
the negative consequences of their investment and production decisions. We
now know those threaten not only capitalism but our planet itself.
Capitalism is  neither profitable  because it  is  efficient nor  efficient
because it is profitable. Rather, efficiency became capitalism’s preferred
code for profitability. It sounded so much better to say that some capitalist’s
business decision was efficient (good for everybody). To instead say that
the same business decision was profitable risked it being seen as good for
only the capitalist. Efficiency made a system that was mostly good for a
minority (capitalist employers) and often bad for a majority (employees)
appear instead to  be  absolutely  and  objectively the  best  for  everyone.
Equating efficiency to profitability did for capitalism what religion did for
European feudalism: it  redirected everyone’s  attention away  from  the
intractable conflict  between lord  and  serf  to  the  unconflicted  heavens
guided by a God who was all good. Instead of accepting and endorsing
capitalism because God tells us to, the economists tell us to do so because
capitalism is efficient. Of course, here in the US, we have quite a few folks
who will insist that capitalism is both godly and efficient.
## Immoral
Morality is  among the  important standards or  measures with  which
alternative economic systems confront and struggle with one another. In
some  definitions of  morality,  some  or  all  outcomes of  markets or  of
capitalist production systems are moral. In other definitions, some or all of
those outcomes are immoral. The debates over the moralities of alternative
economic systems often broaden to a debate over morality itself.
Modern capitalism started in England, spreading to Western Europe and
then to the rest of the world. It mocked and rejected many of European
feudalism’s  moral commitments. Because medieval Catholic teaching
widely held  the  charging  of  interest on  loans  to  be  sinful, usury  was
prohibited. The church regulated markets around the concept of what it

believed to be the “just” price. For centuries, the church also condemned
private property in land as deeply immoral. In contrast, the capitalism that
replaced feudalism embraced lending at interest, urged sellers to charge
“whatever the  market will  bear,”  and  made  land  (and  much  else)  a
commodity with no moral taint.
Eventually, the church gave in. Religion adjusted to the transition from
feudalism to capitalism by supporting the latter as fully as it had supported
the former. Religions accommodated capitalist morality’s replacement of
feudal morality. Capitalism developed other institutions that articulated and
enforced morality alongside the religious institutions: secular schools, mass
corporate media, advertising, and so on. In the drive for profit, capitalist
enterprises often  found  themselves producing more  than  markets could
absorb. To persuade people to purchase more goods and services, modern
capitalism created  the  advertising industry.  Advertisers’  clients—mostly
capitalist employers—pay them to promote those clients’ produced goods
and services to potential buyers. Advertisements invade every corner of
capitalist societies with carefully crafted messages that deeply affect our
sense and definitions of morality. Real and imaginary positive qualities of
every advertised product are stressed repeatedly. Negative qualities of every
advertised product are minimized or hidden. Instead of discussions about
objects that  evaluate their  good  and  bad  qualities to  create a  balanced
assessment, advertising hammers at  us  a  model of  discourse  that  is
systematically dishonest. Exaggeration slides into lying, and both settle into
social life as obvious, routine, and largely accepted parts of modern culture.
Morality accommodates.
The ways capitalism uses technological progress entail immorality as
well. For example, imagine a new machine that is twice as productive as an
old one. Typically, a capitalist employer fires half the employees, produces
the same output as before (thanks to the newly installed machine), charges
the same price, and thus earns the same revenue. This employer’s profit,
however, has risen by the amount of wages no longer paid to the fired
workers. Those saved  wages become the  employer’s  profit. The  fired
workers and their families suffer the lost wages, and their communities
suffer the secondary effects of the workers’ lost wages. In capitalism, the
employer is not held responsible for having installed new technology in a
manner that caused such suffering. If existing definitions of what is moral
include caring for other human beings and minimizing others’ suffering,

then immorality is built into capitalism’s core structure. Or the definition of
morality must be radically altered.
The immorality of this employer’s profit-driven behavior resides in the
neglect of  the  alternative mode  of  installing the  new  technology: the
employer could have fired no workers and still taken full advantage of the
new machine by cutting all workers’ labor time in half and yet paying them
the  same  wage. That  would keep  output the  same  as  before the  new
technology,  and  likewise—with  price  and  total  revenue unchanged—the
employer’s  profit  would be  the  same  as  before the  new  machine was
installed. The technical change had the potential to revolutionize the lives of
the  employees (the  workplace’s  majority) by  converting half  their  work
time into leisure (time for relationships, art, sport, etc.). That potential is
usually ignored, while profit maximization is treated as the appropriate step
to take. Yet the choice between these alternative ways of installing new
technology has a clear moral dimension. Ignoring the moral choice does not
mean it disappears. Many conventional moralities would have to find that
capitalism often uses technology in immoral ways.
Critics of markets have denounced their immorality for many centuries,
since well before modern capitalism. Markets allocate whatever is scarce—
whatever generates demand that is higher than its supply—to the bidder
offering  the  highest price  (likely among the  richer  buyers). Most  moral
systems would not endorse distributing scarce goods that way. They would
rather offer other criteria for allocating scarcities, such as buyers’ different
needs, community needs, or possible combinations of these.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt instituted rationing in the early 1940s to
prevent market immorality from controlling the United States during World
War II. His logic held that during wartime—when consumer goods were
scarce because resources had been shifted to producing military goods—
letting the market govern consumer goods’ scarcity would be immoral. The
rich would bid up the prices of what they wanted among scarce consumer
goods, while those with middle and low incomes would be unable to afford
those higher prices. A wealthy family could pay more for milk to feed a pet
cat. Meanwhile, a poor family couldn’t afford the higher-priced milk for
their  children. The  market handles scarcities, no  matter their  particular
causes or origins, by favoring the richest over everyone else. To say the
least, there are moral problems with doing that. FDR suspended the market
and  substituted rationing across  the  US.  Scarcities were  handled by

distributions based on need, not on the relative wealth of buyers. Scarce
taxicab rides,  scarce preschools,  scarce sporting-event tickets,  scarce
restaurant tables: such goods are often handled by markets in the same
immoral manner. They go to those able and willing to pay the much-higher-
than-usual prices charged for them. Sometimes, laws render it illegal to
charge  more  than  the  usual  or  cost-determined or  regulated price  when
scarcity occurs. However, even then, higher prices occur often “under the
table.”
Another example,  pertinent to  contemporary history,  can  illustrate
capitalism’s  structural immorality.  Rising prices—or “inflations”—are
another regular part of capitalism, recurring from time to time and place to
place across the world. An inflation happens if and when employers in
general (not necessarily everyone) raise the prices they charge for whatever
goods and services they sell. The immediate cause of inflations then, is
employers raising their prices. This will damage employees’ real incomes
unless they can raise their money wages at rates equal to or more than the
rate of inflation. This employees rarely manage to do. Typically, prices rise
more than wages. If so, employers gain and employees lose. A minority
unaccountable to  the  majority can  and  does  take  actions that  directly
damage the majority. In a context where democracy is considered a moral
imperative, inflation is thus immoral. That immorality is then magnified
when we consider that inflations usually present all potential buyers with
the same raised prices, and that those are more burdensome for the poorer
than the richer. The US and Europe experienced a general, serious inflation
after 2020. Of course, a morality that equates market outcomes with the
good  would not  find  these  results of  inflation to  be  a  moral  problem.
Particular industries can likewise experience inflations even if and when the
rest  of  the  economies surrounding  those  industries experience  none,  or
different rates of inflation. Sometimes we have developed special words for
inflations in particular industries. For example, the word “gentrification”
refers to an inflation in housing (houses and/or apartments).
Gentrification is a market phenomenon. Landlords are constantly trying
to get more money out of their properties by raising the rent or the price of
a home. When prices rise, those who cannot afford the higher prices usually
start looking at properties just outside that neighborhood. In the nearby
neighborhoods, landlords can then decide to raise their prices as well. The
process often repeats itself; gentrification expands. Neighborhoods change

as prices rise. Stores and restaurants geared to the poorer people who were
there before (often for decades) go out of business or move. “Upscale” or
“higher-end” stores and restaurants replace them.
Gentrification is  how  the  market  in  housing works. Where morality
enters the picture is when we ask what happens to the former inhabitants of
the  now-gentrified homes. Why  were  they  forced to  leave their
neighborhood? How is a family’s life disrupted when they have to leave
their old home, neighbors, and schools? Few recognize the question; fewer
still worry about the answer. In practice, the victims of gentrification are
ignored or, if they protest, probably repressed. In the US, private landlords
have mostly succeeded in preventing public housing from competing with
private housing. Conventional morality recoils at  the  spectacle  of  how
capitalist markets “manage” the US housing system. Morality that has fully
accommodated itself to capitalism does not.
Instead of  diverse communities, housing markets and  gentrification
produce uniform areas and neighborhoods segregated along lines of wealth
(and,  therefore,  race).  The  gentrifier often  complains: I  moved into  a
vibrant, old,  diverse community  for  just  those  qualities, but  as  the
gentrification proceeded, all those qualities vanished, and a stale, richer
uniformity took  over.  If  our  nation could  discuss, debate, and  make  a
democratic decision on what kinds of neighborhoods we wish to live in,
different moral sensibilities might play a role in the final decision. Instead,
“let  the  market decide” covers for  the  reality that  markets let  the  rich
decide.
No morality is universal. But in this book, it is our view that market
outcomes are frequently immoral when they force people to move against
their will or distribute basic necessities to the highest bidder.
In relation to morality, consider also the simple structure of capitalist
enterprises. A tiny number of persons at the top—owner, partners, corporate
board  of  directors—make all  the  basic  workplace decisions and  wield
dominant power. If morality—as derived from religious or other ethical
systems—requires treating others as human beings in a relationship of basic
human equivalence, capitalism violates that  morality in  its  workplaces,
where most adults in society spend most of their lives.
Out  of  competition for  ever-greater sources of  labor,  resources, and
markets, capitalism’s old centers (Europe, North America, and Japan) have
spent much of their history colonizing vast portions of the rest of the world.

Colonialism often  began with  massive violence (sometimes  genocidal)
perpetrated against populations, and it required ongoing violence to protect
and  operate the  colonies. The  moral  implications of  such  a  process go
without saying. Colonies themselves also suffered as subordinate entities to
the colonizing countries’ economies. Land, people, and natural resources of
colonies were reorganized with enormous losses of lives and cultures. After
state  independence was  established for  many colonized countries,
neocolonialism functioned in the same way.
Liberty,  equality,  fraternity,  democracy,  and  most  other  measures of
morality played secondary if any roles in what was done in and to colonies.
To  the  extent capitalism today contradicts those  values, it  also
contradicts morality. To the extent that future systems challenge capitalism
in the years ahead, concerns about morality will animate such challenges.
Self-Destructive
The seeds of capitalism’s self-destruction are always present. In order to
persist through time, capitalism’s defining employer/employee relationship
both requires and shapes the processes of profit maximization, competition
among employers, economic growth, technical progress, and  other
mechanisms in the economy. However, all those processes have side effects.
They often undermine capitalism, block its success, and lay the groundwork
for its undoing. Let’s take a few examples.
Employers buy and install machines in their factories, offices, and stores
when  the  machines are  more  profitable than  the  workers they  replace.
Having lost their jobs, the replaced workers lose their wages. With less or
no wages, the workers can no longer purchase the products that capitalist
employers seek to sell. Unsold products undermine an employer’s profits,
just as the newly installed technology was supposed to raise profits.
Competition among employers can  lead  them  to  improve products’
qualities as a way to attract business, boost profits, and grow. However,
competition can  likewise lead  employers to  cut  corners, such  as  by
substituting cheaper,  lower-quality inputs, in  ways customers  may
eventually identify and reject, thereby depressing the employers’ revenue
and profits.

Karl  Marx called such  features of  capitalism the  system’s
“contradictions.” He  showed how  the  tensions among capitalism’s
processes, pushing and  pulling (often in  opposite directions), gave
everything in the capitalist system its particular movement and ways of
changing over time. For example, whether profits rose or fell depended on
all  the  processes influencing profits in  society.  Each  process partly
strengthens profits and partly undermines them. What finally determines
whether profits rise or fall at any moment depends on all the processes of
the whole society. All of them together will create a final net effect: the
actual profits we find.
The term “overdetermination” was used by Marxist philosopher Louis
Althusser to summarize three basic, interconnected ideas: (1) that every
process that  makes up  a  society influences every  other,  (2)  that  every
process is pushed and pulled in different ways and directions by all the
other  processes overdetermining  it,  and  (3)  every  process thus  exists  in
contradiction and  change. Each  part  of  a  society overdetermines and  is
overdetermined by all the other parts of that society.
Another way  to  say  this  is  that  capitalism—like everything else—is
always contradictory and always changing. To understand something means
always to grasp its contradictions, the good opposite its bad parts, and their
resulting movement. To grasp only one or the other side is to be precisely
one-sided. Whatever contradictory conditions or  qualities we  find  in
anything—like the changes in it—are the results of its overdetermination.
Capitalism is  one  such  set  of  overdetermined processes existing in
change. Each  of  its  constitutive processes is  uniquely overdetermined,
changing in its particular way.
Marx  described capitalism as  a  complexity whose parts  “develop
unevenly.” Each part of capitalism is uniquely overdetermined by both the
other parts of capitalism and all the other processes comprising capitalism’s
social and natural environment. It follows that capitalism’s reproduction in
time  and  place  depends on  how  its  overdeterminants are  changing and
thereby changing their impacts upon capitalism’s processes.
Let’s suppose the process of selling the outputs of capitalist enterprises is
overdetermined in a way that threatens capitalism. For example, a change in
customers’ tastes makes them stop buying a particular dyed fabric from a
group of producers. Capitalist producers of that dyed fabric are threatened
with the death of their enterprises if their sales stop. If someone can come

up with another social process to offset the former buyers’ changed tastes,
the  threatened fabric makers can  be  saved. So,  someone invents the
advertising industry, which finds ways to publicly associate that particular
dyed fabric with being attractive to potential lovers. The threatened fabric
makers then  distribute a  portion of  their  revenues to  advertising
corporations as  payment for  producing and  distributing  such
advertisements. The ads change fabric tastes and revive dyed-fabric sales.
The changed fabric tastes changed capitalism by adding an advertising
industry. A changed capitalism with a new advertising industry will provoke
other  firms  and  industries to  purchase advertising. An  industry that
communicates by  telling the  public all  the  good  things about  a  client’s
product while hiding all the negative qualities has complex social effects.
For example, it spreads its type of discourse into personal, family, and work
relationships. Instead of thinking and speaking about the balance of positive
and negative aspects of and in all those relationships, people think more in
the style of advertising. They see positives or negatives rather than unities
of both. That changes those relationships in particular ways that react back
upon and change capitalism, possibly threatening it in more ways than taste
changes ever could.
For another example: capitalism’s profit drive has relocated its dynamic
center from  one  to  another place  across its  history.  From  England,
capitalism’s dynamic center moved partly to Western Europe and partly to
the US to exploit their labor power and resources for greater profits. Within
the  US,  capitalism’s  dynamic center moved from  New  England to  the
Midwest, then to  California, in  search of  capital-friendly government,
resources, and land. In more recent decades, capitalism’s dynamic centers
relocated to China, India, Brazil, and the Global South more generally for
their cheaper labor and to escape organized labor in the US and Europe.
Capitalism’s relocations unraveled the British Empire, are now unraveling
the US’s, and may enable a new Chinese empire. Growing social difficulties
in  all  the  areas  that  capitalism relocated away  from  raise  the  question:
Might capitalism’s  profit-driven relocations be  the  early  stages of
actualizing its  self-destruction?  Unintended consequences always  follow
from  change because they  multiply through the  endless links  of
overdetermination.
Using  an  overdeterminist approach to  capitalism finds,  explores, and
evaluates its strengths and weaknesses, its growing and declining elements,

and how its larger environment (social and natural) supports and yet also
undermines it. Like a good doctor assessing our body, a thorough evaluation
takes into account the contradictions overdetermined in our body by our
body’s  environment, its  interacting parts,  and  the  connections between
them. No single medical test suffices to measure and evaluate something as
complex as a human body. A good doctor needs multiple diagnostic tests
(blood, X-ray, MRI) to “get a picture” of the influences, reactions, and
processes that  comprise anyone’s  “health.” A  doctor using an
overdeterminist approach (self-consciously or not) knows and admits that
such a picture is always partial as well as changing.
In  human history,  each  economic system is  usually born  out  of  a
previous system in  decline. Given its  over-determination, each  system
changes; it evolves and develops. Since different economic systems usually
coexist, they change internally but also change one another. Eventually,
each changing system begins a decline, out of which new economic systems
are born. In this precise sense, all systems eventually self-destruct. There is
no reason to think capitalism is any different.
When the self-destructive elements in a system get strained to the point
of  threatening its  continuation,  the  question becomes: Can  the  system
change to overcome the strain, or will it collapse? One way or another,
economic systems persist until they no longer can.
Capitalism’s  capacity for  self-destruction has  achieved widespread
understanding now via the global movements around the issues of climate
change and  environmental degradation. For  centuries, apologists for
capitalism have assured us that inequality can be managed if the system
grows. An  ever-larger  pie  allows everybody to  be  satisfied with  their
increase in  consumption without a  contested redistribution. And  yet,
environmentalism shows that  perpetual growth threatens our  natural
environment and  thus  our  survival. No  growth or  degrowth ideas  make
battles over redistribution of the wealth produced in capitalist economies
necessary for  our  survival. As  was  always true,  in  those  battles over
contradictions lurks  the  potential for  systemic self-destruction. It  has
become almost commonplace (although still  hotly  opposed by  vested
interests, right-wing ideological warriors, and  others) to  see  inside
capitalism a growth fetish that threatens not only capitalism’s survival but
that of our species. What many economists disrespected by using the term
“externalities” includes the many, many unacknowledged, unmeasured, and

yet  deeply  dangerous side  effects  of  capitalism upon  our  natural
environment. Those externalities undermine the efficiency claims used to
justify capitalism. More importantly, environmental costs reinforce the need
to  explore—more than  has  yet  been  done—the tendencies toward self-
destruction built into capitalism. As the philosopher G. W. F. Hegel might
have said and as his student Marx explained: self-destruction has always
been “the other side” of capitalism’s creative capacities.

## CHAPTER 4
The Myths of Capitalism
rom  its  beginnings, the  capitalist economic system produced both
critics and celebrants, those who felt victimized and those who felt
blessed. Where victims and critics developed analyses, demands, and
proposals for  change, beneficiaries  and  celebrants developed  alternative
discourses defending the system.
Certain kinds of argument proved widely effective against capitalism’s
critics and  in  obtaining mass  support. These became capitalism’s  basic
supportive myths.
Capitalism Created Prosperity and Reduced Poverty
Capitalists and their biggest fans have long argued that the system is an
engine of wealth creation. Capitalism’s early boosters, such as Adam Smith
and  David Ricardo, and  likewise capitalism’s  early  critics such  as  Karl
Marx, recognized that fact. Capitalism is a system built to grow.
Because of market competition among capitalist employers, “growing
the business” is necessary, most of the time, for it to survive. Capitalism is a
system driven to  grow  wealth, but  wealth creation is  not  unique to
capitalism. The idea that only capitalism creates wealth or that it does so
more than other systems is a myth.
What else causes wealth production? There are a whole host of other
contributors to  wealth. It’s  never  only  the  economic system: whether
capitalist or feudal or slave or socialist. Wealth creation depends on all
kinds  of  circumstances in  history (such  as  raw  materials, weather,  or
inventions) that determine if and how fast wealth is created. All of those
factors play roles alongside that of the particular economic system in place.
When the USSR imploded in 1989, some claimed that capitalism had
“defeated” its  only  real  competitor—socialism—proving that  capitalism

was the greatest-possible creator of wealth. The “end of history” had been
reached, at least in relation to economic systems. Once and for all, nothing
better than capitalism could be imagined, let alone achieved.
The myth here is a common mistake and grossly overused. While wealth
was created in significant quantities over the last few centuries as capitalism
spread globally, that does not prove it was capitalism that caused the growth
in wealth. Maybe wealth grew despite capitalism. Maybe it would have
grown faster with some other system. Evidence for that possibility includes
(1) the fact that the fastest economic growth (as measured by GDP) in the
twentieth century was that achieved by the USSR, and (2) the fact that the
fastest growth in wealth in the twenty-first century so far is that of the
People’s Republic of China. Both of those societies rejected capitalism and
proudly defined themselves as socialist.
Another version of this myth, especially popular in recent years, claims
capitalism deserves credit for bringing many millions up out of poverty
over the last two to three hundred years. In this story, capitalism’s wealth
creation brought  everyone a  higher standard of  living  with  better  food,
wages, job conditions, medicine and health care, education, and scientific
advancements. Capitalism supposedly gave huge gifts to the poorest among
us and deserves our applause for such magnificent social contributions.
The problem with this myth is like that with the wealth-creation myth
discussed above. Just because millions escaped poverty during capitalism’s
global spread does not prove that capitalism is the reason for this change.
Alternative systems could have enabled escape from poverty during the
same period of time, or for more people sooner, because they organized
production and distribution differently.
Capitalism’s profit focus has often held back the distribution of products
to drive up their prices and, therefore, profits. Patents and trademarks of
profit-seeking businesses effectively slow the distribution of all sorts of
products. We cannot know whether capitalism’s incentive effects outweigh
its slowing effects. Claims that, overall, capitalism promotes rather than
slows progress are pure ideological assertions. Different economic systems
—capitalism included—promote and delay development in different ways
at different speeds in their different parts.
Capitalists and their supporters have almost always opposed measures
designed to lessen or eliminate poverty. They blocked minimum wage laws
often  for  many  years,  and  when  such  laws  were  passed, they  blocked

raising the minimums (as they have done in the US since 2009). Capitalists
similarly opposed  laws  outlawing or  limiting child  labor,  reducing the
length of  the  working day,  providing unemployment compensation,
establishing government pension systems such as Social Security, providing
a  national health insurance system, challenging gender and  racial
discrimination against women and people of color, or providing universal
basic income. Capitalists have led opposition to progressive tax systems,
occupational safety and health systems, and free universal education from
preschool through university. Capitalists have opposed unions for the last
150 years and likewise restricted collective bargaining for large classes of
workers. They have  opposed socialist, communist, and  anarchist
organizations aimed at organizing the poor to demand relief from poverty.
The truth is this: to the extent that poverty has been reduced, it has
happened despite  the  opposition of  capitalists. To  credit  capitalists and
capitalism for the reduction in global poverty is to invert the truth. When
capitalists try to take credit for the poverty reduction that was achieved
against their efforts, they count on their audiences not knowing the history
of fighting poverty in capitalism.
Recent claims that  capitalism overcame poverty are  often  based  on
misinterpretations of certain data. For example, the United Nations defines
poverty as an income of under $1.97 per day. The number of poor people
living on under $1.97 per day has decreased markedly in the last century.
But  one  country,  China—the  world’s  largest  by  population—has
experienced one of the greatest escapes from poverty in the world in the last
century, and therefore, has an outsized influence on all totals. Given China’s
huge influence on poverty measures, one could claim that reduced global
poverty in recent decades results from an economic system that insists it is
not capitalist but rather socialist.
Economic systems are eventually evaluated according to how well or not
they  serve  the  society in  which they  exist.  How  each  system organizes
production and distribution of goods and services determines how well it
meets its  population’s  basic  needs for  health, safety, sufficient food,
clothing, shelter,  transport, education, and  leisure to  lead  a  decent,
productive work–life balance. How well is modern capitalism performing in
that sense?
Modern capitalism has now accumulated around a hundred individuals
in the world who together own more wealth than the bottom half of this

planet’s  population (over  3.5  billion people). Those hundred richest
people’s financial decisions have as much influence over how the world’s
resources are used as the financial decisions of 3.5 billion, the poorest half
of this planet’s population. That is why the poor die early in a world of
modern medicine, suffer from diseases that we know how to cure, starve
when we produce more than enough food, lack education when we have
plenty of  teachers, and  experience so  much  more  tragedy.  Is  this  what
reducing poverty looks like?
Crediting capitalism for poverty reduction is another myth. Poverty was
reduced by the poor’s struggle against a poverty reproduced systemically by
capitalism and capitalists. Moreover, the poor’s battles were often aided by
militant working-class organizations, including pointedly anti-capitalist
organizations.
Monopoly, Not Capitalism, Is the Problem
Defenders of  modern capitalism  have  often  presented it  as  built  on  a
bedrock of  competition. They  describe capitalism as competitive—
understood as a market system in which there are many buyers and sellers
of  everything,  so  no  one  of  them  has  the  power to  shape  any  price.
Suppliers are said to respond—in terms of the quantities produced and their
market prices—to what people want and demand. Every capitalist’s profits
depend on the market prices of whatever they sell. Workers do not accept
wages that  are  below market averages, because they  are  free  to  work
elsewhere for higher wages. They likewise demand and obtain the lowest-
possible prices by forsaking sellers who charge above the basic costs of
production. Competition disciplines all the sellers into charging the lowest-
possible price. Competition thus assures that prices and wages reflect both
the best that suppliers can produce, and the optimum benefit buyers can
obtain from their purchases.
The myth here is the idea that such a capitalism, if it ever existed, could
persist. In actuality, where and when competition exists, it self-destructs,
thereby reducing the perfectly harmonious market to a mere myth, not a
reality.
The  goal  of  competition is  to  end  the  competition: somebody wins.
Winners gain market share, and losers are driven out of business. The failed

businesses sell the equipment they no longer need at sale prices to winners
still in the business. Former employees of firms that went out of business
often find new jobs with the competitive winners. In short, competition
turns the many sellers into fewer firms until few or only one is left. When a
few businesses dominate the market, economists call that an oligopoly. It
can survive if those few take steps to stop competition among themselves. If
one seller outcompetes the others and becomes the only seller in the market
for  some  product, the  winning seller—called a monopolist—is  able  to
dictate the price to all potential buyers.
A  monopoly firm  can  wield  supreme market power.  Monopolies can
raise prices (and their profits) above competitive levels because they alone
control the supply. Most monopolists do; that’s why competitive markets
self-destruct. They have a built-in incentive for firms to seek monopoly
profits by achieving monopoly positions in their markets, and every firm
fears  that  another firm  will  achieve such  a  position first.  This  is  why
competitors stress growing their firms: to accumulate the maximum profits,
which can then be used to temporarily absorb lowered prices used in the
race toward oligopoly or monopoly. Capitalism is a system designed to
grow  and  to  consolidate its  early  competitors into  oligopolies and
monopolies. Forbidding monopolies, or breaking them up into competitors,
only drives monopolization underground or restarts a cycle of competition
that will yet again self-destruct.
Marx  applied Hegel’s  notion of  contradictions in  his  analysis of
monopolies within capitalism. The high profits achieved by oligopolies and
monopolies eventually entice new  competitors into  the  market, each
seeking a piece of those high profits. In this way, monopoly self-destructs in
favor of competition. Dozens of automobile companies in the US shrank to
an  oligopoly of  three—Ford, GM,  and  Chrysler—before those  three
attracted new,  foreign competitors (Toyota, VW,  and  many more
nowadays). The  variety of  cars  in  the US  illustrates how  competition
negates monopoly just  as  monopoly negates competition. Of  course,
competitors and  oligopolists/monopolists can  approach governments to
erect all sorts of barriers to slow or stop movement in either direction. Then,
the struggle becomes political as well as economic.
Myth enters the analysis when capitalism’s supporters treat oligopoly
and  monopoly as  if  they  were  not  intrinsic phases of  an  inherently
contradictory capitalism. Defenders of this system portray oligopoly and

monopoly as antithetical, foreign elements that distort the competition of
capitalism. They say monopolies render capitalism imperfect and impure
(their words). These defenders often do admit many of the criticisms of
capitalism; but  attribute them  to  oligopoly and  monopoly. They  believe
removing the oligopolistic and monopolistic distortions would leave us with
a capitalism that can solve the world’s problems and is the best economic
system we can achieve. Policy proposals follow this thinking under the
heading of “anti-trust” laws and regulations.
Their mistake is imagining a capitalism without oligopoly, monopoly, or
the intrinsic tendencies toward them that every capitalism on record has
experienced. This  myth  invites the  demonization of  monopolies and
oligopolies, and  it  diverts critical  attention from  capitalism  itself.  For
example, in 2022–23, critics of raging inflation blamed it on monopolies
and their pricing powers (even though the previous twenty years displayed
the  same  monopolization but  without inflation). Returning a  monopoly
capitalism toward a  competitive capitalism resumes all  the  tendencies
toward the self-destruction of competition: a policy doomed by its blindness
to capitalism’s contradictions.
The  concept of  a  pure,  perfectly competitive capitalism (without
oligopolies and monopolies) is a myth.
## Capitalism Is Uniquely Innovative
Champions of capitalism have long argued that it is uniquely innovative:
that the profit motive and competition have provoked innovation far more
than previous systems could, and that capitalism is far more innovative than
socialism could  be  or  has  been.  However,  the notion that  capitalism is
uniquely and positively innovative is a myth.
First, each economic system contributes to innovations in its own way.
Each system promotes innovation in some parts of society more than others,
among some people more than others, and around some activities more than
others. Innovation in some areas is even stifled or slowed in favor of other
areas. In short, the qualities of innovation vary from one economic system
to another. Reducing these qualitative differences to a simple measure of
quantity—such as more versus less—is a dubious undertaking. How do we
quantitatively compare an innovation in woodworking to one in childcare?

What counts as an innovation, and how it is assessed and measured, vary
from time to time and from place to place. Nor are the purpose and meaning
at  all  clear  of  reducing qualitatively different innovations to  some
homogeneous, simplified quantitative measure of  more and  less.
Capitalism’s innovations are different from those of feudalism, slavery, and
other systems of the past and likewise different from socialisms of the past,
present, and future. Beyond empty boasting, notions of “more” or “less”
innovation are myths.
Second, many  innovations happening during  capitalism  should not
necessarily be attributed to capitalism. What about innovations developed
despite capitalism: the  breakthroughs achieved by  an  individual after
countless corporations had  offered only  discouragement? Modern
computers were partly developed in US universities and by the US military,
at least partly because profit-driven capitalists would not take the financial
risks involved.
Third, US corporations have repressed certain innovations because they
threaten profit. Long-lasting light  bulbs  mean  that  fewer  get  purchased.
Planned obsolescence is another gift of capitalism’s profit drive in which
innovation becomes deliberately wasteful, as the journalist Vance Packard
taught many  decades ago.  Mass  public transportation could  save  many
lives,  avoid  more  injuries, save  many  natural resources, and  reduce
pollution and  dangerous climate  change. Instead, driven by  the  profit
incentive, we now replace gasoline-powered private vehicles with electric
private vehicles. This is certainly an innovation, but not the one we most
need  and  not  the  change from  which we  might  well  benefit far  more.
Fourth, employees in capitalism have often repressed innovations because
they led to machines that threatened workers with unemployment.
Finally,  profits have  incentivized innovations society now  sees  as
partially or wholly destructive, such as burning coal or nuclear reactions to
generate electricity,  cigarettes, alcohol, synthetic opioids, asbestos,
Roundup fertilizer and many, many more.
Knowing all the innovations, good and bad, occurring in any one society
in any one period is exceedingly difficult. Measuring it would be even more
so,  as  would be  measuring those  innovations  that  were  repressed.
Comparisons of  different  societies’  or  historical periods’  innovativeness
have  not  been  persuasive. Yet  capitalism’s  defenders’  claims linking

capitalism to  innovation persist because they  believe them  to  be
persuasively effective.
Human beings interacting with one another and with the rest of nature
have  always been  innovative. People have  always recognized problems,
obstacles, and opportunities in their lives and responded to them with new
ways of doing things—innovations—across all realms of human activity
(economic, political, cultural, or  personal). They  have  often  wanted to
communicate their innovations to one another and across generations and
have even innovated to do just that.
Cold War politics required as many ridiculously lopsided comparisons as
possible between capitalism and socialism. One was good, and the other
bad.  Innovation, a  good  thing, was  attributed to  capitalism and  then
contrasted with its absence, a bad thing, attributed to socialism. The idea
that  “anyone can  start  a  business and  innovate under the  spur  of
competition” was said to be true of capitalism but not of socialism. Yet the
USSR, for  example, exhibited  much  small  business formation on  its
collective farms, in its service sector, and in its black markets, all replete
with  competition and  innovations. Its  defense industries, among others,
have good reputations for innovation to this day. The People’s Republic of
China today enjoys a global reputation for all sorts of innovations in its
society, especially in hi-tech sectors competing with the US. Indeed, pre-
capitalist economic systems—such as ancient Greece, Rome, and medieval
Europe—made major breakthroughs in  agriculture, industry,  warfare,
governance, and other crucial parts of social life. Each was different, but the
assertion that capitalism was innovative while other systems were less so is
mere ideological self-promotion.
The notion that capitalism is somehow more innovative is a myth.
Markets Are a Neutral, Efficient Way to Distribute Goods and
## Services
“Market mechanisms” and  “market solutions”: politicians, bureaucrats,
media pundits, and academics like to refer to them as if they were somehow
uniquely fair and optimally efficient, which they are not.
The problems with the market system of distribution appear immediately
if the demand for an item is higher than its supply in the market. Buyers

compete for the item in short supply by bidding up its price. As prices rise
for such goods or services in short supply, the poorer buyers drop from the
bidding because they cannot afford the higher prices. Eventually, the price
stabilizes at whatever higher level equated the demand to the supply. When
demand is less than supply, the reverse happens, and prices drop.
Thus, markets distribute items in relatively short supply in a manner that
discriminates against those  with  little  or  no  wealth relative to  the  rich.
Markets are in no way neutral to or “above” conflicts between rich and
poor. Of course, sellers could choose not to accept the higher prices some
buyers offer and instead produce or order more products to sell. They could,
in short, choose to respond to short supply by increasing that supply. In free
enterprise capitalism, the decision whether to respond to supply shortages
by raising prices (inflation) or by increasing production is left to a tiny
minority of the population: employers. Employers decide based on what
maximizes their  profits. The  rest  of  us  live  with  the  consequences of
employers’ profit-driven decisions.
When employers profit from inflating their output prices, free market
advocates argue  that  the  rising  price  is  how  the  market “signals” to
producers to manufacture. Their incentive is to tap into the high profits
generated by high product prices. However, this “signaling” feature is well
known to  all  employers. If  any  employers respond to  the  signals by
producing or  ordering more  to  increase the  supply,  the  high  prices  and
profits-per-product will disappear. So, employers often exhibit no rush to
produce more. Indeed, employers stuck in competitive markets envy the
monopolizing employers and proceed to copy them: that is, by restricting
supply to generate higher prices and profits. And, as high prices proliferate
through the market system, more and more sellers begin to excuse raising
their own prices because their “costs have risen.” The rest of us watch this
spectacle of employers profitably using one another as excuses for raising
prices.
Capitalists long ago learned that they could profit by manipulating both
supply and demand. In that way, they could create “shortages” that would
enable them to get higher prices. Capitalism created the advertising industry
to boost demand above what it might otherwise be. At the same time, each
industry organized to  control supply (via  informal agreements among
producers, mergers, oligopolies, monopolies, and cartels). Changes beyond

the  control  of  capitalists require them  to  constantly adjust how  they
manipulate demand and supply.
Looking for a job is also handled by markets in modern capitalism. If
people looking for jobs outnumber the available jobs, employers can lower
wages, knowing that desperate people will often take low wages rather than
risk  no  wages. Historically,  this  process caused a  huge  backlash, with
workers demanding and  fighting for  legally enforced minimum wages.
Employers everywhere fought against minimum wage  laws.  When,
eventually, such laws were won, employers resisted raising the minimum
wage—often successfully. For example, the US federal minimum wage rate
of $7.25 per hour was kept from rising between 2009 and 2024 (when this
book was written). Employers manipulate the supply and demand for labor
power to keep down its price (wages) just as they manipulate the supply and
demand for  output to  keep  up  its  price.  Employers replace employed
workers with machines (automation) and thereby increase the supply of
workers looking for  jobs.  That  usually depresses wages. Employers
likewise relocate jobs overseas, depriving US workers of jobs and thereby
forcing them to swell the supply of US workers looking for jobs just as
employers have left to buy labor power overseas. Thus, the reduced demand
for and the increased supply of US workers depresses wages. Manipulation
of  the  labor  power  market in  these  ways  aims  to  lower  wages, just  as
manipulation of the product market aims to raise prices. Profit drives the
capitalist system.
While actual capitalists manipulate demands and  supplies,  their
defenders praise the mythical abstraction of competitive markets that make
capitalist economies ideally efficient by equating supplies to demands (as if
they were not continuously subject to capitalists’ manipulations).
Markets existed long before capitalism, but capitalism, as Karl Marx
noted, spread them  throughout societies to  unprecedented degrees.
Capitalism praises markets—and their  prices—to levels of  ideological
intensity that risk approaching absurdity. As R. H. Tawney so brilliantly
showed in  his Religion and the Rise of Capitalism,  early  European
capitalism had to fight hard to displace the notion of a “just” price inherited
from  the  medieval Catholic Church. The  “just” price—consistent with
God’s  laws  and  Christ’s  teachings  as  interpreted by  the  church—often
differed from the “market price” of manipulated supplies and demands. To
win that fight, preachers of capitalism built a kind of secular religion around

markets and their prices, attributing God-like qualities of efficiency and
fairness to them. However, as capitalism sinks into ever-deeper trouble, it is
time  to  debunk economic myths  as  part  of  finding our  way  to  better
institutions and, indeed, to a better system.
## Capitalism Enriches Those Who Deserve Riches
There is no evidence that proves the rich ever worked harder than the rest of
us.  But  they  would  like  us  to  think  so.  Wealth  is  mostly about  what
positions you occupy in the capitalist system. Are you in a place to which
riches are  distributed or  not?  Most  of  the  rich  in  capitalism do  not
accumulate their wealth because of work they do (hard or otherwise), or
from wages or salaries paid for such work. Rather, their incomes flow from
the wealth they own, from their positions as propertied. They owe their
wealth to the rents, interest, dividends, capital gains, and profits that accrue
to  the  positions  they  occupy as  owners of  land,  money,  shares, and
businesses. Capitalism does not care how an individual comes to occupy
such positions (by inheritance, theft, financial maneuver, family intrigue,
etc.). In capitalism, income flows to the position of wealth owner (no matter
who occupies that position or how they got to do so).
Able-bodied, noninstitutionalized adult individuals typically earn
incomes in capitalism as employees by working. They sell their labor power
(the ability to work) to an employer. For most, working secures the great
bulk of their income throughout their lives. Any such employee who also
owns productive property (i.e., land, cash, shares, etc.) can earn additional
income beyond their wages or salaries by permitting employers to use that
property in  producing goods  or  services for  sale.  The  problem is  most
people own little or no productive property beyond their labor power. They
rely on performing labor to earn income. They spend that income chiefly to
pay  for  their  consumption; most  have  little,  or  nothing left  to  buy
productive property.  Without significant private property,  employees’
income is based on selling their labor power.
Rarely do people become rich if they are not rich to start with. The
capitalist world over  the  last  several centuries provides the  evidence.
Occasional rags-to-riches stories of employees who became employers are
the much-hyped exceptions that prove the rule. Most working-class people
figure that  out—even if  it  takes  years  for  them  to  see  through the

employers’ smoke screen about how “hard work pays off.” Most of the rich
inherited wealth or got crucial help from rich people, enabling them to
become rich (or richer). Elon Musk, arguably the world’s richest individual,
came from a family that owned airplanes and emerald mines. Bill Gates’s
mother was wealthy. Jeff Bezos’s parents gave him $245,000 to get Amazon
going as an enterprise. Warren Buffett assembled rich partners (including
his wealthy businessman and politician father) who gave him money. The
rich are mainly owners of significant amounts of property.
The workers whose labor produced the output and thus the revenues do
not get the surplus contained within them. Whether they work very hard,
just plain hard, or not hard at all is largely irrelevant. Because they are
excluded from  distributing the  surplus their  labor  produces, productive
workers rarely get any of it. Capitalism gives employers alone the social
position of determining to whom to distribute the system’s surpluses. As
should surprise no one, they distribute it to that small circle of the very rich
from whom they mostly come. As we have seen, capitalism further enriches
the already rich.
Education doesn’t make students rich, either. Students who became rich
were those who found their way into capitalist positions receiving large
distributions of  the  surplus, not  because of  some  particular training. As
countless young careerists have  had  to  learn  the  hard,  bitter  way:  in
capitalism it matters less what you know than who you know. What matters
is which position within capitalism your friends, family, and associates can
help you get relative to the surplus.
The lucky few top executives join the ranks of those already rich from
inheritance, from theft, or from poaching on the Global South—those areas
of  the  world  that  capitalism colonized. Top  corporate managers include
those charged with “growing the enterprise,” or “capital accumulation.” If
successful, a growing capitalist enterprise can further enrich the already rich
and add more individuals to those it enriches. The cycle begins again, and
the rich become richer by providing employers with access to their private
income-generating property.
In  these  ways,  capitalism has  become synonymous with  ever-greater
income and  wealth inequality.  Sometimes, majorities revolt  against the
system because of those inequalities. Sometimes, they succeed in getting
minor changes (called “reforms”) of  the  system’s  income distribution.
Sometimes, the  revolt spreads and  deepens. In  those  rare  moments,

demands grow beyond reforms of the system to a revolution, a change in
the system.
Both reformist and revolutionary demands are rejections of the myth that
rich people in capitalism “deserve” their wealth. In place of those myths,
reformers, and revolutionaries often grasp that capitalism is a system that
allows and incentivizes some to accumulate wealth produced by others. If
your grandparents and your parents were not rich, you are likely not rich
either. They were, like you are, excluded from distributing the surplus that
productive labor yields. Therefore, the resulting surplus distribution kept
them from becoming rich and instead made the already rich even richer.
How bitter, then, the chagrin of the formerly rich, those who lost that
position in  capitalism that  had  enriched them. Nothing about their
personality,  acquired wisdom, or  artistic creativity can  recover their
formerly rich status. After losing their private income-generating property,
they must sell their labor power—the sad condition of most of their fellow
citizens in capitalism. If no employer wishes to purchase their labor power,
even  that  source of  income vanishes. The  psychological costs  of  their
descent might explain their declines from corporate bigwig to skid row
drunk. They blame themselves for losing their wealth.
Blaming one’s  individuality,  however,  distracts attention from  the
profound ways that capitalism determines who is rich and who is not. You
are not southern versus northern, outgoing versus inward, tall versus short,
happy versus sad, and so on because you “deserve” it. To think that way
mistakes an outcome for an origin. You are the way you are because of all
that happened to you. What you did or did not do, what choices you did or
did not make were only details. Your decisions and acts were small parts of
the  much  larger  overdetermination  of  all  that  happened to  you  in  your
family, household, friendships, school, church, job, marriage, and so on. All
that happened to you thus positions you in one or another place within the
capitalist economy. And that position determines whether you are rich or
not.
To  say  the  rich  deserve their  status  effectively short-circuits  all  the
complex ways and infinite variables that together determine our lives. The
rich who claim they deserve their riches need the poor to blame themselves
for being poor. Otherwise, the poor might blame the system that assigned
them  to  that  position, or  they  might blame the  rich.  Fear  of  those
possibilities has always driven the troubled consciences of slave masters,

lords  of  serfs,  and  employers of  employees. Thus,  they  cultivated and
imposed on their societies the myth that inequalities of wealth, income, and
power reward individual merit and effort.
No one should be surprised that corporate executives regularly reward
themselves richly,  even  when  the  corporations they  run  lose  money for
years. It was never about results; it was always about position within the
capitalist system. Teaching capitalism’s victims to blame themselves—the
myth of meritocracy—reduces the risk that the employer class will reap the
justified rage of the employee class.
Obscene Wealth Is Justified by Huge Social Contributions
Wherever obscenely rich people have existed, they have gone to extreme
lengths to protect their wealth and its privileges from the nonwealthy people
working for  them. Emperors, kings, czars, masters of  huge  slave
plantations, lords of big feudal manors, and major shareholders and top
executives of capitalist megacorporations have all secured protection by
armed force  (security guards, police, judiciaries, military) and/or by
controlling politicians. Donations, control of mass media, lobbyists, and
bribery “won” the required political decisions. Laws, regulations, school
curricula, proclamations, electoral campaigns, and so on were the means to
justify the  distributions that  enabled extreme wealth and  its  inevitable
counterpart, extreme poverty.
In  today’s  capitalism, one  such  myth  argues  that  obscene wealth is
society’s  reward  for  those people who  make the  most  important
contributions to social progress. In two currently popular examples, Elon
Musk deserves his tens of billions because he contributed the electric car,
and  Jeff  Bezos deserves his  tens  of  billions for  bringing us  the  speedy
ordering and delivery of goods. However, there is a serious logical mistake
involved in this mythological argument.
We can show this by considering the man who proudly tells visiting
guests, “I added that wing of the house myself.” The visitors understand the
words that are  missing: “I  purchased the  construction services—labor
power, knowledge, skill, and materials—that actually produced the home
addition.”

Yet the Musk and Bezos myths work differently. They want us to believe
that they built Tesla and Amazon. Of course, they did not. They purchased
the labor power, knowledge, skill, and materials that actually built those
corporations. Taken  together,  the  many  different people’s  contributions
were indeed considerable: all that went into electricity, computers, design of
automobiles, provision of metals and plastics, communication technology,
and much else. All Musk’s and Bezos’s money did was buy all the goods,
services, and knowledge those people had accumulated over years. What is
wrongly called “Musk’s electric car” or “Bezos’s delivery services” would
have  been  impossible without  all  those  prior  contributions. To  reward
contributions and contributors justly would entail rewarding them all. But
capitalism does not work that way. Typically, it disproportionately rewards
the buyer of produced inputs and labor who also sells the final product.
The relevant parallel here is a village battling to escape flooding from a
nearby river’s impending overflow. A group of villagers gather to dig sand,
acquire sandbags, fill them with sand, and then pass them forward from
person to person. The last person standing closest to the river—perhaps
called Elon—can then pile those bags on the river’s bank. The sandbags
prevent a catastrophe, and the village is saved. The villagers collect $10,000
to  show  their  gratitude and  give  the  money to  Elon.  Rewarding an
individual at the end of the line rather than sharing the reward among all
those  who  collaborated to  produce the  outcome is  unjust. It  also
incentivizes individual self-aggrandizement over  teamwork when the
community is far better served by teamwork. If contributors to the anti-
flood  effort  had  competed for  Elon’s  individual position, disrupting or
delaying the team effort, the village might have been washed away, and no
reward would have been offered at all. The village would have done better
to distribute the collected $10,000 to reward all villagers who collaborated
in preventing the flood.
People may try to justify extreme wealth by pointing to the philanthropy
that  some  extremely wealthy individuals sometimes choose to  perform.
Look at what good they are doing! Surely, they are being responsible with
the wealth they have, and therefore deserve to keep it. While this myth
implicitly condemns the many extremely wealthy who perform little or no
philanthropy,  it  also  celebrates a  deeply anti-democratic process. When
extremely rich people make philanthropic “gifts,” they decide individually
what social causes to focus on, what problems to solve, and what activities

to support. Their individual, private choices have social effects. We all must
live with what a few extremely rich people decide to support financially.
That  is  the  opposite  of democracy.  If  the  people have  to  live  with  the
decisions about how to spend large amounts of money, then the people
should have democratic rights of participation in those decisions. That is the
logic of elections, where all can equally cast their votes for the political
leaders whose decisions all have to live with.
The US gives philanthropists tax reductions for the “gifts” they give
away, yet that diminishes the funds available to the local, state, and federal
governments. The government must, therefore, (1) cut the public services
they perform, (2) raise taxes from others (often the nonrich), or (3) borrow
to replace the revenue lost through rich people’s “gifts.” Service cuts or
increasing government debt affect us all, yet a tiny minority of significant
philanthropists’ decisions impact our lives, even though that tiny minority is
not accountable to us. Slowly, the government, and any form of democracy,
lose control over wealth, while those thereby enriched have more and more
influence to affect public life.
The cost of extreme wealth includes a major loss of democratic self-
governance. We  are  long  overdue a  referendum on  whether we  as  the
majority support extreme wealth for a minority, given the damage that does
to democracy.
The  justification of  obscene wealth based on  its  owners’  social
contributions is a carefully cultivated myth that equally carefully ignores all
the considerations described above.
## Capitalists Deserve Profits Because They Take Risks
An old defense of capitalism: “Capitalists risk their money, energy, and
time to start or expand businesses. Profit is their reward. Societies benefit
from capitalists’ risk-taking. Since profits are the incentive for capitalists to
take socially beneficial risks, capitalists deserve profits.”
No doubt employers take real risks. Enterprises can and do fail, losing
capitalists’  invested money and  resources. However,  capitalists seeking
profits are hardly the only risk-takers.
In  today’s  capitalist societies, all  sorts  of  productions are  undertaken
without the  involvement of  profits. Communities build  sports centers,

children’s playgrounds, and schools, for example, without profit accruing to
those communities. Governments produce many different outputs without
profit being the goal. Churches do likewise. All the above decision-makers
take risks that their projects may not achieve their goals (which need not,
and  usually do  not,  include profit). Taking  risks  to  produce goods or
services neither requires profit nor justifies capitalism.
However, if the point of risk-taking myths is that risk-taking should be
compensated, then one must ask: Why only compensate employers’ risks?
They  are  not  enterprises’  only  risk-takers. In  every enterprise, the
employees, their families, and their residential communities also take risks.
Employees take risks when they go to work for a company. They become
dependent on a job and income that could be lost. When choosing a job,
employees and their families often devote their time, energy, and money to
move  into  a  community (with  new  schools for  children to  attend, new
neighbors to  befriend, and  a  new  home  to  buy  or  rent). The  risks  that
employees face depend on employer decisions over which the former have
little  or  no  power.  Their  employers may  move  production overseas or
automate their jobs. Their employers may be unable (or unwilling) to pay
taxes  or  repay  loans  and  then  decide to  close  the  enterprise,  depriving
employees of jobs. Employees, their families, and their communities risk
suffering the  consequences of  employers’  profit-driven decisions  about
jobs.
Employees’ incomes come from wages that pay for the labor power they
sell to their employers. Employees are not paid for the risks they take. If
employers demand  and  get  profits for  the  risks  they  take,  why  does
capitalism routinely deny employees shares of profits for the risks they
take?
There is  also  an  important difference between employees’  and
employers’  risk-taking. The  employers who  take  risks  in  starting or
expanding an enterprise are also its key decision-makers. They know the
details, conditions, and prospects of the risks they take. They have some
ongoing control over the risks they take.
In stark contrast, the risks employees take depend on the employers’
knowledge—from which employees are excluded. A good case could be
made that the risks that employees face are, thus, actually greater than the
owners’. Were  profit  really  a  reward for  risk-taking, then  profit  should
always be divided among all risk-takers. In capitalism, however, profits

accrue not to workers but to employers. If employers are entitled to make
the  decisions  about  the  businesses they  risk  starting and  running, then
workers too should share in owning and running the businesses because
they take comparable risks by working there.
The notion that employers’ profits are somehow justified by risk or risk-
taking is a myth.
## Profit Best Motivates Production; Capitalism Exalts Profits
Another myth holds that profit is the only (or most powerful) motive of
production.
Profit is one among many motivators of people’s actions. Love and hate,
sex and jealousy, fear and greed, solidarity and loyalty are among the many
others. Motivations can  be  material, as  in  cash,  but  they  can  also  be
symbolic, as in awards from well-reputed institutions.
Profit may motivate someone to provide a socially useful service. Profit
may also motivate some socially regressive actions. Profit motivates drug
and food companies to produce and sell dangerously adulterated products.
Profits drive automobile producers to install devices that defeat pollution
regulations. Profits sustain the cigarette, gun, pornography, gambling, and
fossil fuel businesses, among many others whose social contributions are, at
best, debatable.
On the other hand, Ludwig van Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
Louis Pasteur, Albert Einstein, and countless other major contributors to
modern life were not especially driven by any prospect of profits or obscene
wealth. Most of them never obtained either.
The  removal of  profit  from  our  economic system will  not  mean  an
absence of  motivations, good  or  bad.  Different  economic systems use
different combinations of  motivators to  secure different mixtures of
behaviors. All  struggle—using trial  and  error—to strengthen  those
motivators that  inspire socially desired outcomes and  to  weaken  those
motivators that create socially unwelcome outcomes. All struggle with the
motivators whose outcomes are  mixtures of  desirable and  undesirable
outcomes.
The  myth  of  profit  as  “the  great  motivator” serves a  purpose.  In
capitalism, employees labor to secure wages and salaries, not profits. Profits

are  the  name  of  that  portion of  an  enterprise’s  income chat  flows
exclusively to its employers. Hyping profit as the sole or grand motivator
serves to justify that flow to employers as if it were somehow good for
society as a whole. Don’t be fooled.
The notion that motivated behavior requires the capitalist system and its
exaltation of profit is a myth.
Raising Wages Hurts Business and the Economy
This myth looks at only one side of a  two-sided process. Raising wages
hurts business in one way and helps it in another. High wages raise the
capitalist’s costs of doing business, yet they also increase the purchasing
power of  the  buying public. How  each  business fares  in  the  balance
between these  opposing forces varies with  each  business’s  particular
conditions. There  is  no  one  way  that  raising wages affects  business in
general, or an economy.
It is logical to suppose that some employers’ profit rates are so small that
raising wages (or any other of their costs) would lead them to close their
enterprises. Yet logic likewise holds that raising some workers’ wages will
raise  their  incomes and  enable them  to  spend  more  (including  on  the
businesses whose wages rose). With more such spending, businesses may
be able to sell more products, hire more employees, raise their prices, and
so on. We cannot know in advance whether jobs lost exceed or fall short of
jobs gained. Actual numbers of jobs lost or gained will, of course, depend
not only on wage increases but on all the many other influences affecting
employers’ hiring decisions. Why, then, are capitalists so often opposed to
raising wages and to the efforts by employees and their unions to push for
them? Part of the answer lies with employers’ ignorance of economics and
knee-jerk reaction to employees’ demands for higher wages. If employers
understood or acknowledged the contradictions of their system, they would
avoid such reactions. Another part of the answer relates to what can happen
if and when wages rise and some businesses (chiefly small and mid-sized)
do collapse. Of course, that problem could be solved easily in a society that
values and  wants  to  preserve small  businesses. A  government subsidy
and/or tax reduction could go to small businesses when they raise wages.
That would help those businesses cope with rising wages while also helping
the  affected employees (useful  since  small  businesses often  pay  lower

wages than large businesses). A powerful movement of small businesses
might ally with labor unions to push for such government support on the
grounds that it helps reduce the social inequality between large and small
business sectors.
A third part of the answer lies in the assumption of many employers that
their  expenditures  on  advertising will  secure them  the  sale  of  all  their
products without needing to increase their employees’ wages. Consumer
debt will enable employees to buy the heavily advertised products without a
wage increase. Believing that, employers will fight wage increases even
when they grasp that higher wages will enhance employees’ purchasing
power.
In  any  case,  the  story  of  how  raising wages is  necessarily bad  for
business is a myth.
## Capitalism Can Be Reformed
Throughout its history, capitalism provoked critics who (like myself) found
it  to  be  undemocratic, unequal, unstable, inefficient, immoral, and
ultimately self-destructive. But  others, the  system’s  defenders, always
insisted that capitalism was and is the highest level of economic and social
development that humans can achieve. Among them, some admitted the
system had flaws and weaknesses but believed these could be fixed by
various adjustments  that  left  its  core  unchanged. Those defenders of
capitalism often came to be called reformers. Some of those reformers,
disappointed in what reforms accomplished, came to believe that reforms
were inadequate. The whole system, they concluded, needed to be changed
from the ground up. They were often called revolutionaries.
Debates between reformers and revolutionaries are part of capitalism’s
history,  just  as  they  were  also  parts  of  the  histories of  other  economic
systems. For example, in the history of slavery in the US, there were those
who approved and celebrated the slave system, but there were also its critics
who wanted to reform slavery. Among reformers, some sought to get better
food, clothing, and shelter for slaves. Some wanted to end the practice of
breaking up slave families by selling their members to different buyers.
Some  focused  on  stopping or  limiting various sorts  of  slave  abuse  by
masters.

However,  there  were  critics who  rejected such  reforms of  slavery as
fundamentally inadequate. They argued that slavery itself—the system in
which some people owned and could thus buy and sell other people—was
the problem to be solved. Making slavery less awful for slaves of African
descent was not the issue, because such reforms, even if successful, were
never  secure. With  continued slavery,  whatever reforms masters  had  to
accept could later be rejected by them. The continuation of slavery meant
that, sooner or later, masters would have incentives to undo those reforms
while the wealth they drew from their slaves gave them the power to do so.
So long as slavery continued, the inequality and injustice of the relationship
between master and slave persisted. Revolutionaries thus targeted the slave
system itself.  Rather than  make  it  less  awful  for  slaves, their  goal  was
slavery’s  abolition. In  the  history of  capitalism, reformers and
revolutionaries play  parallel roles.  Mentioned here  are  a  few  of  many
possible examples taken  from US  capitalism’s  history. After  decades of
difficult struggles, child labor in the US was eventually forbidden by law.
Banking reform laws have typically passed after the more serious of many
repeated banking system failures (including 1907, 1929, and 2008). Rules
and  regulations  on  railway safety usually followed the  more  serious
accidents and  derailments. Finally,  the  federal minimum wage  (first
legalized in 1938) aimed to reduce income inequality by placing a floor
under wages.
Every one  of  these  reforms was  weakened or  eliminated—often
repeatedly—after it was enacted. As of mid-2023, the US Department of
Labor was pursuing hundreds of ongoing cases of illegal child labor, with
many  more  likely  unreported as  employers hired  immigrants’  children
whose parents feared protesting to US authorities. After each of the many
reforms of  the US  banking  system, banks  used  their  profits to  evade,
weaken, or  end  those  reforms because they  imposed profit-reducing
constraints on bank activities. The 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act (a
reform passed in  1933  responding  to  the  Great  Depression), led  to  the
2008–2009 bank-collapse catastrophe. After  2008–2009, we  had  further
reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank Act. President Donald Trump rolled those
back. Every few years, yet another banking system failure arises. Over the
decades, many railway safety rules and regulations suffered similar profit-
driven evasions,  weakening, and  repeals. Hence, the US  has  suffered
innumerable railway problems, such as the February 2023 disaster in East

Palestine, Ohio, that  released hazardous materials into  the  nearby
community. The US federal minimum wage was raised to $7.25 per hour in
- For the next fourteen years, it remained frozen at that level by the US
Congress, even as consumer prices rose by over 20 percent.
Capitalism provokes reforms because of  its  profit-driven actions and
their social consequences. In response, social movements arise demanding
reforms. In  turn,  the  reforms constrain profit  maximization and  thereby
incentivize capitalists to fight against the reforms by blocking them, or at
least  delaying them  (often for  decades). Employers fight  individual
workers, labor unions, and social movements directly, but even more so via
politics. They  use  their  resources (accumulated profits, borrowed funds,
etc.)  to  donate to  parties and  candidates, to  hire  and  support armies of
lobbyists working with elected officials, and to shape mass media coverage
of  their  activities in  fighting reforms. If  mass  action by  social  or  labor
movements still wins reformist laws, policies, and regulations, capitalists
adjust their fight. Employers then focus more on evading, weakening, or
repealing the  laws  and  regulations. They  use  their  profits to  reduce or
remove the constraints on their profits attributed to the reforms they object
to. One way to do this became so commonplace that it acquired the name
“regulatory capture”: when  government regulators are  controlled by  the
employers they  were  supposed to  regulate. Other ways  include the
relocation of enterprises to places where reforms do not exist or are not
enforced, employment of immigrants whose legal status makes them fearful
to  report  employers’  violations  of  reformist laws  and  regulations, and
various illegal activities.
The  blocking  and  delays of  reforms, like  the  subsequent evasion,
weakening, and repeal of whatever reforms are achieved, damage the lives
of  millions of  workers—and always have.  There  lies  the  basis  for  the
revolutionary alternative. In a repetitive history, capitalism’s organization of
the  economy—into employers and  employees driven to  profit via
competition—provokes both reforms and opposition to those reforms. Few,
if  any,  reforms are  permanent;  none  are  invulnerable to  attacks  by  the
employer class. The employers’ ever-1 profit opportunities determine how
hard its attacks will target which reforms.
Beyond reform lies the possibility of system change. We could change
the organization of workplaces to deprive any small minority from sitting
atop and controlling the mass of working people. We could democratize

enterprises such that all basic decisions (what, how, where to produce, and
what  to  do  with  profits) are  made  by  majority votes  of  all  workplace
participants. “One person, one vote” would be the basic principle governing
the enterprise and the larger economy within which enterprises function.
Multiple goals—not just profit maximization—would be what democratized
enterprises strive  to  achieve. New  problems and  contradictions would
animate such  a  post-capitalist  economic system. Capitalism’s  intrinsic
problems and contradictions—and the reforms they provoke—would fade
into memories as people focused, rather, on doing better than capitalism.
## Socialism Has Failed
After  the  1989  collapses of  Eastern European socialisms, capitalism’s
cheerleaders intensified their claims not just that those socialist societies
had  “failed”  but  that all  socialisms—all its  different  forms—had failed.
They  treated those  claims as  if  they  were  obvious, universal  truths.
However, there are multiple, different interpretations of the 1989 collapses,
as there are of all important historical events. While some regimes once
widely identified as socialist have dissolved, especially in Eastern Europe,
others have not, including the People’s Republic of China, Cuba, North
Korea, and  Vietnam. Some forms of  socialism have  prospered quite
dramatically, strengthening over the last thirty years. China’s annual rates of
GDP growth have been consistently about triple those of the US. China’s
growth rates for average real wages have exceeded those for US workers by
even more. Vietnam’s recovery from the extremely destructive US invasion
and occupation has been remarkable and widely recognized as such. For
over  half  a  century,  despite US  sanctions and  embargoes,  Cuba  has
developed some of the most advanced educational and medical systems in
the world. They now serve as models for many other countries.
The  nineteenth century fostered  the  growth of  socialism chiefly  as  a
political and  theoretical critique of  capitalism. Socialists’  practical
experiments appeared in  their  formation of  labor  unions, anti-capitalist
political parties, and  anti-capitalist  social  movements. Socialists  learned
lessons along  the  way  about  which experiments should be  preserved to
become building blocks for a new post-capitalist system and which should
be rejected as incompatible with that project.

The  twentieth century saw  one  of  these  experiments, the  taking  of
political power by  Russian revolutionary socialists, confront the  task  of
constructing a  noncapitalist, specifically socialist economy and  society.
With the important exception of the localized Paris Commune in 1871, no
post-capitalist construction of a nation or major region had been on the
agenda of socialists before. The twentieth century saw Russia, China, and
areas  across the  world erupt  with  socialist experiments in  social and
economic construction. All of these experiments in socialism (and others,
such as Scandinavian socialism and social democracies elsewhere) have
yielded a rich variety of lessons about (1) what was positive and should be
preserved and (2) what was negative and should be excluded by twenty-
first-century forms of socialism.
Capitalism did not spring fully formed from the ruins of feudalism, and
socialism cannot do  so  from capitalism. Countless groups of  early
capitalists undertook experiments, and many did not last long, undone by
feudal opposition, political mistakes, or lack of cultural acceptance. Early
capitalist experiments were  thus  not  simple “failures”; they  generated
crucial lessons for the eventual success of capitalism. It took centuries for
the necessary conditions to develop and allow later experiments in forms of
capitalism to take off and become the model for modern global capitalism.
In parallel fashion, nineteenth- and twentieth-century forms of socialism
yielded lessons for twenty-first-century forms.
Over the last two centuries, socialism, as a combination of theories and
practices of social change beyond capitalism, has become a powerful social
movement across the world. Socialist theories and practices spread with and
because of  capitalism. Socialist  newspapers, political parties,  unions,
political organizations, professional associations, and more became routine
presences in most countries (including becoming governments in many).
Socialists’ demands often passed into law. Sometimes, the term “socialist”
was  explicitly involved. At  other  times, alternative terms (“social
democracy,”  “democratic socialism,” “the  New Deal,” “leftism,”
“radicalism,” “eco-socialism,” “socialist feminism,” and so on) were used
to describe parts of the broader socialist tradition. To condense all of that
rich tradition of socialist theory and practice—much of it now sedimented
into the laws, regulations, and customs of many nations—under the heading
of “failure” makes little sense.

Within other social movements, such as anti-colonialism, disarmament,
peace, anti-racism, feminism, and environmentalism, socialists repeatedly
moved to effective leadership positions. Another great success of socialism
has  been  the  task  of  keeping  alive—against massive repression and
ideological warfare—the understanding that  capitalism has  systemic
alternatives and  that  its  profound problems might best  be  solved by
changing to one of those alternatives.
Among socialism’s failures has been the hesitance of so many of its
adherents to go beyond focusing on the state in their work. Nineteenth-
century European socialism focused strategically on capturing the state (via
elections or revolutions) and then using state power to transition society
beyond capitalism.  Twentieth-century global socialism used  that  state-
focused strategy to seize state power in many places. To this day, most
socialists articulate their goals as having the state modify, lead, and regulate
their economies toward greater wealth equality, less instability, and greater
social justice. Most  socialists  still  presume that  the  organization of
production around employers (small groups of people that own and/or run
enterprises) and employees (large groups of workers doing what employers
tell them) is necessary or normal. Such socialists differ from supporters of
capitalism because  they  believe the  employers should be  either private
individuals subject to heavy state regulation and controls, or else officials of
state-owned and operated productive enterprises.
Workers taking state power is, at best, a means; the end has always been
a full social transition beyond capitalism. But, the socialist workers’ states
replaced private capitalists with state officials while leaving unchanged the
internal organization  of  enterprises: the  employer/employee structure
inherited from capitalism. The overfocus on the state played no small role
in enabling concentrations of power in socialist states that proved damaging
to,  and  eventually destructive of,  those  socialist states. Many  socialists
came to criticize and reject those concentrations of state power. Yet most
still  do  not  articulate socialism’s  goals  as  including the  end  of  the
employer/employee organization inside workplaces and its replacement by
a democratically run worker cooperative. Failure to do this has weakened a
socialism that  might  otherwise have  risen  further given  the  deepening
problems of so many capitalist systems today.
The  history of  twentieth-century socialist experiments attests to  the
trials,  tribulations,  and  costs  of  transitions beyond capitalism  that  were

begun and developed, but ultimately also blocked. It may not have been
possible, under the actual conditions of the twentieth century, for socialists
to go much beyond taking and stabilizing state power. However, there was
no good excuse then—and there surely is none now—for not facing the
contradictions, costs, and failures of being blocked from making the further
transitions that  had  motivated socialists to  seek  state  power in  the  first
place. Refusing to face its experiments’ contradictions and limits proved
very costly to socialism. It is thus very important for socialists to do so now.
The  declaration  that  “socialism failed” is  as  much  a  myth  as  the
declaration that it is an achieved success. Socialism remains very much a
work in progress.
Dismissals of socialism—as a “failure”—are sometimes undertaken with
a different ideological purpose. Such dismissals refer to “the millions killed
by  Joseph  Stalin  and  or  Mao  Zedong.” The  idea  is  to  blame  socialism
and/or communism for what those particular leaders or regimes did. These
are  “count-the-deaths” sorts  of  historical arguments. Body  counts are
notoriously poor historical evidence, and all sorts of problems attach to
blaming systems for what individuals do, but the argument surfaces often
enough to  invite a  critical response. There is  no  question that  the
tumultuous transformations in Russia after 1917 and in China after 1949
were traumatic in many ways, and that a lot of people died. But that is also
true of capitalism, only more so.
Shall we blame capitalism for the deaths caused by various leaders and
regimes that  presided over  capitalist economies? How  many  tens  of
millions of deaths should be blamed, then, on the following: (1) European
colonialism (for  example, Britain’s  empire in  India through Partition)
during capitalism’s ascendancy from the eighteenth century to the present,
(2)  World  War  I,  fought by  countries in  which the  capitalist  economic
system prevailed, and (3) World War II, likewise (including Russia’s dead
millions owing to Hitler’s war against Russia)? Existing historical sources
would suggest that  deaths attributed to  capitalist leaders, countries, and
corporations outnumber those attributed to major Communist Party leaders
like  Stalin  and  Mao.  Mass  murder has  been  a  part  of  the  evolution of
colonialism as the extension of capitalism. Dismissal of socialism on the
basis of death counts reveals mostly the political biases and ideological
goals of those who make such counts.

## CHAPTER 5
The Relationships of Capitalism
he word “capitalism” has been used to refer to many different things.
Were all writers to identify which particular meaning of the term each
uses, no problem would arise. Sadly, that is not the case, and much
confusion results from proceeding as if we all knew and agreed on some
singular meaning of “capitalism.” To avoid that confusion, this book tries
carefully to  acknowledge differences and  explain why  and how  we
understand capitalism in  one  particular way.  Here,  capitalism is  that
particular kind  of  economic system that  organizes the  production and
distribution of  goods and  services  in  enterprises or  workplaces divided
between employers and employees.
This chapter of the book looks at how the capitalist economic system
influences other aspects of modern societies. Capitalism is not the only
cause  of  these  other  parts  of  society,  nor  are  they  always products of
capitalism. However,  prevailing ways  of  thinking largely ignore, or
misunderstand, the  relationships between capitalism and  other  important
parts  of  society.  For  our  purposes, such  relationships highlight how
capitalism contributes to so many social problems, and why solving those
problems often requires challenging and moving beyond that system.
Capitalism and the State
The two most popular assumptions about the relationship between the state
and capitalism seem nearly opposite. One side claims to see the state as a
burden on  the  capitalist economy.  The  other  side  sees  the  flaws  of
capitalism as requiring government interventions into economic affairs to
keep the system going. The anti-state side spends much time and energy
demonizing the government and blaming state interventions in the economy
for those shortcomings of capitalism they can admit. The more capitalism

relies on government (favorable tax and tariff systems, subsidies, managing
the money supply), the more urgently its anti-state defenders reject any
dependency by  capitalism on  the  state.  History can  help  untangle  these
contradictions.
When capitalism  became the  dominant system in  England and  then
spread to Europe, capitalism’s celebrants wanted to emphasize their new
system’s break from feudalism. They adopted the French term laissez-faire
—meaning a  capitalism free  from  state interference—as a  defining
adjective of the capitalism they celebrated. For them, the forms of state they
hated and rejected were the “absolute states” of late feudalism. That was the
time of super-powerful kings and queens whose centralized power served to
slow feudalism’s decline. Those monarchs used their absolute state’s power
also to hobble emerging capitalists with constraints. To break free from the
monarchy’s influence, capitalists forged alliances with all those dissatisfied
with feudalism. They engaged in a revolutionary project that promised a
new,  republican system, with  government democratically controlled by
citizens, not  kings. Runaway serfs  who  became capitalists’  employees,
merchants, growing industrial capitalists, independent artisans, and some
other groups gathered in towns across Europe. From there, they challenged
the feudal economic system, monarchism, and religious institutions allied
with them. Capitalists celebrated their revolutionary movement as driven by
the  goals  of  liberty,  equality,  and  fraternity.  Capitalist employers joined
serfs and their own employees in overthrowing old feudal governments,
with the aim of thereby achieving transition from feudalism to capitalism.
Given their  origins amid  the  absolute states  of  declining feudalism,
revolutionary capitalists sought to overthrow feudalism to finally unchain
their  emerging  capitalism. As  the  European transition to  capitalism
proceeded, beyond fights with a declining feudalism, a growing capitalism
also provoked clashes between industrial capitalists and their employees.
Capitalists realized that a strong state of their own could keep employees in
line, producing surplus values for their employers. The state’s police and
military organizations could  enforce laws  protecting private property. A
strong state could also mediate conflicts among capitalists. For example,
when some capitalists took advantage of their market position to extract
monopoly profits, other  capitalists could  utilize state  power to  regulate
monopoly pricing. Capitalists needed strong governments, yet  they  also
feared and resented them. That ambivalence never ceased.

Meanwhile, money itself—central and  crucial for  capitalism’s
development—proved badly vulnerable to corruption and instability in the
hands of either governments or capitalist moneylenders. Deals were struck
to  balance the  power: monetary authority was  vested in  governmental
institutions but  required inputs from  private bankers. Again, capitalists
recognized their  dependence on  government, yet  they  retained a  deep
inherited distrust of governments.
Capitalism’s impetus for incessant growth also required military forces
to protect existing colonies, access new colonies, and prevent capitalists in
other  countries from  blocking that  access. Colonialism and  imperialism
needed strong states wielding  strong militaries. On  the  other  hand,
capitalists worried about the costs of such a military (how much they would
be taxed for it) and the risks of putting too much power in government
hands. What finally emerged from this tension is today’s military-industrial
complex, where capitalists profit  from  producing military goods and
services sold to their governments. In return, the government shifts the huge
resulting tax burdens (to pay for military goods and services) largely off
capitalists and onto the working class.
The democracy that capitalists promised in their anti-feudal revolutions
meant suffrage. However, restricted at first, that suffrage tended relentlessly
toward universality. The problem for capitalists was always this: with truly
universal suffrage, employers would never be more than a small minority of
the voting population. Employees would be the majority. If employers and
employees clashed within capitalism, universal suffrage would enable the
employees to use the vote to overrule employers. The employees could
undo the economy’s unequal income distribution and reverse dominance
from  employers  to  employees. Rather than  some  monarch dictating to
capitalists, it would then be employee voter majorities. Capitalists “solved”
the universal suffrage problem by developing systems to control elections
and their results. They coupled universal suffrage with unequal influence
based  on  buying votes,  candidates, and  parties, suppressing voters, and
gerrymandering. All such mechanisms enable capitalists’ money to control
and shape voting. Capitalists accumulate the wealth that enables them to do
that; their employees do not.
Throughout capitalism’s  history,  from  its  colonial past  through its
neocolonial present, it has had to navigate between its needs for and fear of
a powerful state. The back-and-forth relation between capitalism and the

state  persists.  To  the  extent that  state  action advances their  interests,
capitalists will support state power. To the extent that state power advances
contrary interests of, say, employees, capitalists undermine, delay, distract,
and denounce state power.
Capitalists have also evolved an ideal role for the state: to mobilize the
general population  to  support capitalism, preferably with  two  or  more
political parties. That allows the staging of elections where one party, or
coalition of parties, wins and rules until the next election, when it or another
party/coalition wins and rules, and so on. What matters is that the different
parties may disagree on a range of issues, so long as they all agree to
maintain capitalism. For example, one party may appeal to and mobilize
people who lean right while another party mobilizes people who lean left.
Or one party may mobilize people who oppose abortion, celebrate guns, and
embrace white supremacy, while another party supports abortion, wants to
ban guns, and demands civil rights for nonwhite minorities. Whatever its
platform, each party explicitly promises voters it will pursue its program
and implicitly demands voters join in endorsing capitalism. Capitalists can
fund two or more parties, confident in the knowledge that while policies on
the explicit issues will vary with election outcomes, support for capitalism
is  assured no  matter which party  or  coalition wins.  In  the  US,  the
Republicans and Democrats perform the assigned roles. In many European
countries, more  than  two  parties do  the  same.  There, even  nominally
“socialist” parties can and do participate in ways capitalists welcome and
applaud. For good reason: all parties support and endorse the prevailing
organization of  workplaces in  the  capitalist manner of  employers and
employees. So long as this system secures capitalism in this way, capitalists
can  and  do  debate over  the  costs  and  benefits of  strong versus weak
government. And they need not care much about the debates’ outcomes.
Libertarians are  forever frustrated because they  champion a  minimal
state as if it really mattered. They are ideological purists preaching to a
choir of capitalists who mostly do not care. Liberals who want strong states
to reform capitalism are also frustrated because the working class wants and
needs reforms from capitalists who do not care. The capitalists tell both
libertarians and liberals (including social democrats, etc.): “If you gather
enough votes on the basis of endorsing and supporting capitalism, you can
govern and tilt toward what you have promised your voters. Your tilt must
remain 90  percent symbolic because it  cannot compromise your  basic

commitment to  endorse and  support capitalism. If you  do  that,”  the
capitalists explain, “we will crush and abandon you and bring a different
party (or parties) to power.” In fact, the capitalists rarely need to explain
this to political party leaders and activists. In the words of Leonard Cohen’s
song, “everybody knows.”
Capitalism and Fascism
Inside the workplace, capitalism relies largely on its own mechanisms to
reproduce itself.  Outside the  workplace, it  relies  more  ambivalently on
market mechanisms and on the state’s parliamentary and police mechanisms
for self-reproduction. In so-called normal times, these mechanisms suffice.
When these mechanisms are unable to manage the tensions and difficulties
of capitalism, the system’s reproduction is jeopardized. Fascism comprises
a set of social changes made to enforce capitalism’s reproduction when the
“normal” mechanisms relied  on  for  that  reproduction fail.  Fascism is  a
weapon in capitalism’s arsenal for dealing with its most serious crises.
In fascism, the state’s leaders and the top echelons of capitalists merge to
enforce capitalism’s methods of production. They often do this under the
leadership and control of a fascist political party committed to arranging,
sustaining, and  controlling such  a  merger.  Sometimes, various sorts  of
“external” threats provoke the turn to fascism. Sometimes, the “normal”
cozy alliances between capitalists and state officials break down and thus
“internally” threaten  the  system’s  reproduction. Then, the  historical
response to both external and internal threats has sometimes been transition
to some form of fascism. Unified in fascism, capitalists and the government
together try  to  destroy the  groups  challenging capitalism, such  as  labor
unions, socialist parties, anti-capitalist intellectuals, and  so  on.  Or,  the
merged leaders of fascism threaten actual or potential political adversaries
into  changing such  that  they  become fascism’s  allies.  In  pursuing these
objectives, fascism usually dispenses with the civil liberties and rights of
capitalism’s “normal times” by use of imprisonment, torture, and killing,
likewise more  than  in  “normal  times.” Hitler  in  Germany,  Mussolini in
Italy, and Franco in Spain offer many illustrations of these typical fascist
methods. Economic and  political  power are  centralized upward in  the
service of fascist power and capitalists’ profit. That profit is then shared by

capitalists and  top  state  officials to  reproduce capitalist relations of
production, fascist organizations, and the governing alliance between them.
Frustrated by capitalism’s instabilities, inequalities, and resulting social
divisions, some employers and employees turn to the right, toward fascist
political leaders who  promise to  “fix”  capitalism’s  worst effects.
Historically, fascist leaders have promised to secure full employment in a
context of full social renewal that recovers a society’s golden-age past of
racial or ethnic purity (usually equated to racial or ethnic superiority). For
example, Hitler sought to reestablish an Aryan German empire, the Third
Reich; Mussolini, a renewed Italian empire; Franco, one for Spain. Using
strong Keynesian-type monetary and  fiscal  policies and  its  quasi-state-
capitalist merger, fascism can mobilize government policy and both public
and private resources to achieve its goal of securing capitalist reproduction.
However,  capitalism’s  cycles, inequalities, and  deepening social
divisions can also provoke a very different turn to the left: socialism.
Socialists mobilize victims of capitalist cycles to ally with capitalism’s
critics. By means of organizations such as labor unions, socialist political
parties, and allied social movements (among women, immigrants, and all
sorts of persecuted groups), socialism became a global force across the last
150 years. While fascism uses concentrated wealth and political power to
reproduce capitalism, socialism uses people power to challenge it. Both of
these are responses to capitalist crises, but with very different goals.
Capitalism uses fascists and fascism to build a political counterweight
against socialists and socialism. Socialist criticisms showed fascists that
capitalism’s flaws—especially instability and its social effects—had to be
admitted. Solutions  had  also  to  be  proposed. So,  fascists crafted  their
analyses and  solutions to  strengthen and  harden capitalism, rather  than
challenge it. Historically,  fascist analyses blame outside agitators for
capitalism’s  flaws, including selected foreign nations: Jews,  Slavs, non-
Aryans, and so on. Today’s “culture wars” are part of this strategy too,
blaming a  society’s  problems on  ethnic and  religious groups, LGBTQ
rights, women’s  rights, and  so  forth.  Fascists often  propose a  social
cleansing: a witch hunt to remove the “problems” from capitalism. Fascists
work  to  destroy socialism and  socialists. Again, Hitler,  Mussolini, and
Franco provide a long list of examples. Fascism envisions a “cleansed”
capitalism that  employs all,  exalts the  nation, and  recovers  its  past
greatness.

Fascism offers  itself  to  capitalism as  a  mass  base,  counterbalancing
socialism and its mass base. Where socialists battled capitalists and the state
those  capitalists dominated, fascists found friends and  funders among
capitalists and major allies among their politicians. Socialists and fascists
confronted each other as parties during elections, but also in street battles
and labor strikes. Capitalists clearly preferred the defensive alliance offered
by the fascists over the socialists who, capitalists feared, favored a working-
class  newly empowered to  dominate economically and  politically.  The
closer socialists  came  to  unionized  power in  capitalist workplaces and
political power in  the  government; the  more  capitalists welcomed the
fascists. The  rising power of  socialism across the  nineteenth  century
motivated German, Italian, Spanish, and  Japanese capitalists to accept
fascist invitations. Other nations’ capitalists were also tempted and flirted
with their fascist leaders and parties.
Fascists learned that they had to play catch-up if they were going to win
workers’  loyalties away  from  the  older  and  usually better-organized
socialist movements. The Nazis did that, in part, by incorporating the word
“socialism” into their official party name and actively soliciting workers to
join  the  Nazi  Party.  Fascist leaders (for  example, Mussolini) were
sometimes veterans of socialist party leaderships who had quit to join the
fascists. Capitalism provokes critics both left and right; it always has.
Capitalism produces fascism periodically: between the two world wars,
it did so in Italy, Germany, Spain, and Japan. In those instances, economic
and social traumas had shaken capitalist economies and societies out of
their prior normalcy. The key example, Hitler’s Germany, emerged from the
distress of a fallen empire. After the Bismarck era had unified Germany, the
country was a successfully growing empire. Yet, the accumulated shocks of
losing World War I, losing the Kaiser (the German emperor), and suffering
the reparations and hyperinflation that followed put the country into a state
of general crisis. Germany’s hyperinflation saw the exchange rate between
US dollars and German marks rise from 160 marks per US dollar in 1922 to
4.2 trillion marks per US dollar by November 1923. In just a few short
years, the savings and self-esteem of Germans shrank to nothing. When the
Great Depression hit in 1929, it took Germany over the edge. An already-
strained political center collapsed. German capitalists confronted the real
possibility of a working-class blaming them and the capitalist system for
their suffering. In 1932, the German left (both socialists—SPD—and the

fast-growing communists—KPD) together accounted for half the nation’s
vote, and the Depression was still deepening. Catastrophe for capitalists
loomed.
German capitalists felt they faced an existential threat. They were a very
small proportion of the German electorate compared to the large numbers
supporting socialists and communists. Because the only other comparable
mass  base  that  existed in  Germany then  were  the  Nazis, Germany’s
president invited Hitler to form a government. Hitler’s fascism immediately
and  literally destroyed the  socialist and  communist parties—their social
institutions, their legal status, and their leaders. Once in power, the Nazi
Party effectively merged its top echelons with those of German capitalism
to form an integrated, state-managed employer class. The fascist coalition at
the  top  of  German  society kept  capitalism safe  from  its  socialist and
communist challengers.
To secure their mass base, German fascists had to attract employees and
self-employed people in  significant  numbers. To  do  that,  they  had  to
compete with  the  socialists and  communists. Where socialists and
communists focused their criticisms on the capitalist class and capitalism as
a system, Hitler targeted Jews instead. Nazis constantly portrayed Jews as
though all were rich and exploitative. In effect, Hitler substituted Jews for
the capitalist class to poach on the socialists’ and communists’ strategies. It
mattered little that most German capitalists were not Jewish and that most
Jews were not capitalist employers. Scapegoating Jewish Germans served a
major need of the capitalist class. It distracted the German working class
from seeing capitalists and capitalism as their enemies.
Leveraging a mass base, a fascist leader like Hitler could negotiate an
exchange: the Nazi Party’s loyalties, votes, and support to German capital
and capitalism, in return for capitalists’ support for the Nazi Party and its
government once in power. German fascism was the final result of that deal.
Fascism got German capitalism through its crises (loss of World War I,
hyperinflation in 1923, and the Great Depression in 1929) without changing
the  core  organization of  the  capitalist system itself.  Fascism  got  other
capitalisms through their crises as well; it remains an option as crises afflict
capitalisms.
Deepening inequality and a declining empire threaten crises for other
capitalisms today: for example, in the US ever more people are questioning
and criticizing the possibility of fascism. Recent elections and deepening

social divisions have raised the question: Will US capitalism move toward
fascism too?  We  don’t  have  fascism in  the US  yet.  And  if  enough
Americans understand this possibility and mobilize to prevent it, it may not
arrive.
We  face  a  crossroads in US  history.  Fascism means a  population
controlled by a government capitalist merger intent on saving capitalism by
enforcing its conditions. Socialism means a social system going beyond
capitalism. These are unstable times in the economy, politics, and social
fabric of our lives. Today, there are two big political questions: First, will an
effective opposition to a fascist solution gather and prevail? And second,
will an effective social movement for transition beyond capitalism arise and
shape the nation’s future?
Capitalism and Racism
In the US, as elsewhere, racism and capitalism struck a deal. Capitalism
would perpetuate racism if racists responded by celebrating capitalism. In
earlier slave  and  feudal economic systems, small  dominant minorities
(masters and lords, respectively) accumulated disproportionate wealth and
power vis-à-vis majorities (slaves and  serfs). Some feudal and  slave
societies used  racism to  justify,  manage, and  maintain their  class
differences. They did this by designating some or all slaves or serfs as races
apart from, different from, and inferior to the races of masters and lords.
Like those other economic systems, capitalism adapted racism to meet its
needs. Capitalists and their defenders crafted particular versions of racism
to cope with several of their system’s basic contradictions.
First among these is the division of the two basic classes of capitalism:
employers and employees. What determined which individuals would rise
to and stay in the dominating class? In a racist logic, if one race “naturally”
had  inherent characteristics suiting them  to  be  employers (intelligence,
command, discipline, etc.) while other races’ characteristics suited them to
be employees, then capitalism’s class divisions could likewise be explained
as “natural.” With parallel logic, if one race were endowed exclusively with
the skills and desires to wield social power over others, then society’s class
divisions simply  followed as  necessary for  social  order.  In  such  logic,
“nature” grades races as superior and inferior. Human beings cannot alter

the natural order. For racists, it follows that it is ignorant folly—or worse—
to try to do so.
When capitalism expanded, and competition among capitalists became
global, capitalists reshaped the colonialism they inherited from earlier times
to  serve  their  needs. Not-yet-colonized territories were  integrated into
capitalist empires. Capital flowed in to produce raw materials and food for
capitalists and  workers in  the  colonizing countries. Sometimes, settler
communities dominated local  economies; others used  colonial
administrations to shape local economic development. Old conceptions of
race  were  adjusted, and  forms  of  racism were  developed to  facilitate
capitalist colonialism. Often using various physical traits (skin tone, body
shape, etc.)  to  demarcate superior from  inferior “races,” the  centers of
capitalism then (especially European, but also North America and Japan)
imposed racialized colonial subordinations on much of the rest of the world.
Such racism helped to justify capitalist colonialism to the colonizers and to
those  among the  colonized who  became complicit with  it.  Racist
justification for colonialism existed long before Europeans brought African
slaves to  the  Western Hemisphere. At  first,  European settlers there
slaughtered and discriminated against Indigenous people, often using racist
explanations for that behavior. That racism carried over to enslaved African
people. Europeans separated themselves from enslaved Africans based on
their distant homelands in Africa and their different cultures, languages, and
skin tones. Europeans had had centuries to develop many kinds of racism to
justify slavery, feudalism, and then capitalism.
However, racism in the US against African Americans has evolved its
own  particular mechanisms and  forms across the  generations of US
capitalism. One form helps enable capitalism to cope with and survive its
own instability. As mentioned above, US capitalism generally distributes
the  impacts of  its  recurring economic downturns unevenly.  White
populations lose less relative wealth and income than their fellow citizens
of color. African Americans shoulder disproportionately more of the costs
of and suffering from capitalism’s instability.
White Americans can make and carry through life plans (to marry, raise
a  family,  accumulate savings, build a  community,  develop skills,
professional contacts, and credentials, etc.) with far-lower odds of having
them disrupted by capitalism’s instability. Unemployment imposed on white
people occurs less  often  and  lasts  a  shorter time,  in  general, than

unemployment imposed on African Americans. White people get relative
security from the ravages of the system’s instability because it distributes
those ravages unequally across the working class. Here lies one cause for
white Americans’ greater traditional sympathy for capitalism. To cultivate
and  strengthen that  sympathy,  capitalism uses  (and  thereby perpetuates)
racism.
Put bluntly—as indeed it often is—the greater victimization of African
Americans than white people within US capitalism is attributed to their
racial identity. That sort of argument blames the differences between white
and Black workers’ economic participation and conditions on their different
racial characteristics. It holds that Blacks are thus paid less, fired more
often, and denied credit more often because their work is less valuable, their
creditworthiness is poor, and so on. Racism is how many US capitalist
employers have “managed” the system’s unequal treatment of Black and
white workers. Parallel racism has also been the way for many employees
to understand the differences between white and Black workers’ jobs and
living conditions. And, throughout US capitalism’s history, that “shared”
racism has facilitated political alliances (as in the Republican Party over
recent decades).
A slightly variant form of such racism arises in the form of opposition to
redistributions of income or wealth. Such redistributions, according to this
thinking, are not “deserved” or justified, because they would punish one
race “who worked hard for it” while rewarding another race “who did not
work hard for it.” Parallel arguments discriminate against recent immigrants
as lazy welfare-seekers, versus earlier (and usually white) immigrants who
“worked hard.” The ideological image here is a kind of meritocracy that
rewards the  harder workers. Racism congeals within such  meritocratic
delusions.
Social struggles to redistribute wealth have been tried repeatedly. They
rarely work, and when they do, they rarely last. Were the root of wealth
inequality addressed, struggles of  redistribution could and  would be
avoided. Were  incomes not  unequally distributed in  the  first  place—as
capitalism does  in  its  division of  revenues between employees and
employers—inequality would not haunt, disrupt, and destabilize the system
as it always has.
Capitalism distributes wealth in particular ways that differ from those of
alternative systems. Criticism of capitalism’s wealth distribution ought to

include a comparative examination of  and  debate over  other  systems’
distributions. Capitalism’s defenders fear where such debates might lead, so
they tend to exclude system change from their discussion about capitalism’s
“distributional problems.”
It remains too difficult for many Americans to see the huge injustice and
the  vast  waste  of  human capabilities caused by  racism against African-
Americans, Indigenous people and immigrants. It remains too difficult for
most Americans to imagine a different economic system, one that does not
divide people into employers and employees and, therefore, neither needs
nor allows racist justifications for the resulting inequalities.
In the minds of many, the mutual reinforcement of capitalism and racism
is  not  conscious.  Making their  relationship conscious is  an  important
component of the social movement to end both. In the US, overcoming
racism requires confronting capitalism as  one  foundation of  racism’s
reproduction. Overcoming racism requires a  transition to  a  different
economic system  that  refuses capitalism’s  defining division  between
employer and employee. In other countries, overcoming racism requires
asking whether capitalism there  plays  a  comparable role  in  reproducing
racism of one sort or another. And, if it does, a similar program of transition
will be in order.
Capitalism and the Environment
The demand upon every capitalist to grow is baked into capitalism. It’s a
kind of carrot and stick. If you grow, you will gain an advantage over your
competitors, but  if  you  don’t,  they  will  gain  an  advantage  over  you.
Capitalism pressures employers to function within a structure of rules that
rewards increased profits and punishes reduced profits, so employers count
only those costs that they are required to pay. Profit is what remains after an
employer deducts costs from revenues. But all too often employers do not
see, or refuse to see, the environmental costs. If a production process fouled
the air, groundwater, soil, oceans, or animals; if it damaged the bodies and
minds of  workers; if  it  raised global temperatures—none of  those
environmental costs would need to be counted or paid by the employer.
They are “external” to the capitalist system’s world of costs capitalists have
to pay (wages and material inputs).

Costs “external” for capitalists are not external for the larger society. For
example, pollution from a factory’s smoke exhaust might not be a cost for
the factory’s employer, but houses in the factory’s vicinity would require
more frequent coats of paint against the smog; people would need to visit
doctors more frequently for respiratory diseases and make more visits to the
laundromat to clean their dirty clothes. These are real costs paid by people
other than the factories’ capitalist employers.
These  environmentally damaging, yet  profitable projects often  create
social  costs  that  exceed their  private profits. Strictly speaking,  if  total
(private plus social) costs exceed total (private) profits, efficiency requires
that the project not be undertaken. But, since private capitalists count and
consider only private costs and benefits in calculating their profits, they can
and do undertake socially inefficient projects on a regular basis. Nothing
better exposes capitalism’s  bogus claims to  efficiency than  taking
environmental costs seriously.
In recent decades, political agitation by environmentalists has brought
this situation to light. All kinds of public agencies have been established to
identify and  measure traditionally “external” costs, enabling new
recognitions of  costs  never  acknowledged before. Schemes have  been
debated over how to bring some of those costs inside the calculus of private
capitalist investors (to  convert “external” into  “internal” costs).
Governments now regularly require “environmental impact studies” before
approving all sorts of infrastructure projects, or press investors to cover
those costs as well as the usual “internal” costs. However, such steps are at
an  early  age  despite the  fact  that  environmental degradation is  at  a
dangerously advanced stage.
Recently, the concept of “green capitalism” has attracted public relations
firms’ interest. Industries often targeted by concerned environmentalists for
their  ecological misdeeds suggest that  laws,  regulations, and criticisms
against those misdeeds are unnecessary. Capitalism will “solve,” or already
is  “solving,” our  environmental  problems. The  system best  solves its
problems on its own, without government interventions. However, the logic
here is highly debatable.
Capitalism created ecological damage because it was profitable. To leave
the profit-driven system unregulated or unchanged risks that profits will
continue to do what they did in the past: produce environmental damage
that is difficult or impossible to reverse. When Russia’s 2022 invasion of

Ukraine and the associated sanctions drove up energy prices, prospective
profits led to the temporary reopening of fossil fuel projects. In the past,
responses to capitalism’s other damages led to the attachment of adjectives
such as “conscious,” “socially responsible,” “soulful,” and “compassionate”
to a hypothetically different capitalism. For a time (not long), the adjectives
distracted attention from the noun. The adjective “green” will likely do the
same for a while. Sooner or later, the underlying prioritization of profit for
capitalists undermines all  adjectives. The  noun, “capitalism,” and  its
imperatives prevail. Nothing better illustrates that point than today’s green
capitalism, forcing  even  our  planetary survival to  be  subordinated to
capitalist profiteering.
Capital still flows to where the profit rate is higher. To the extent that
capitalists can evade the environmental costs of their investments, they will.
So,  too,  will  they promote “free  market” ideology:  that  private profit
calculations should alone govern investment decisions. In short, capitalism
continues to fight for a private market efficiency that simply is not there. To
protect their private market (and, more importantly, their profits), capitalists
have spent heavily to persuade their employees to resist environmentalism
and  even  fear  it,  threatening workers with  job  and  income losses if
employers ever have actually to cover environmental costs.
Capitalism, in  its  systemic pursuit  of  profit  and  growth, has  been
fundamentally destructive of  our  environment. The  employer/employee
relationship is the foundation of this system. More and more, the world is
learning that  we  are  approaching the  point  of  jeopardizing humanity’s
survival. Having evolved through and changed from village economies to
slave systems to feudalism and to capitalism, we know we can change our
economic systems. We can do better than capitalism.

## CHAPTER 6
Capitalism and You
e are all shaped by the people, institutions, and events surrounding
our birth and growth. That means capitalism affects you in all the
dimensions of your life. Not only does it shape our jobs, income,
and working conditions; it influences our experiences of schools, friends,
families, and literally everything else. The employer/employee system of
production influences every relationship we have.
This  book  has  discussed capitalism’s  undemocratic nature, general
instability, inefficiency, the inequality it generates, the social problems it
aggravates, and more. But now, let us explore how capitalism affects and
shapes you, the reader of this book.
## You Are Exploited
Right now, as you read this paragraph, you are being robbed. A chunk of
everything your  hard  work  creates is  being  taken  from  you.  And  it’s
capitalism that’s robbing you. Every day, when you check in to work for
your boss, you are being taken advantage of. You are being deprived of the
full value of what you contribute. Let me break it down.
The pursuit of profits to accumulate money is simply how capitalism
works. But where does this profit come from? That’s where you come in.
Profit comes from you. This process plays out across your city or town,
your state, the country, and the entire world—the rich get richer, and most
of the rest get by, even if only barely. We call the process—a boss’s stealing
from  you—“exploitation.” We  don’t  mean  that  in  an  emotional sense.
Exploited is  not  necessarily how  we feel  about  it  (though  it  could  be).
Exploitation is, in fact, a part of capitalist workplaces—the gap between
how much value the worker produces and how much value workers get paid

in  wages  or  salaries. Exploitation is  a  universal feature of  capitalist
economies.
As described earlier in this book, everything about the work we do is
designed to maximize the difference between what we get paid and the
value of what our labor adds to what our employer sells. We all know it—
maybe not  consciously—but the  name  of  the  game  is  to  rip  us  off,  to
forever try to make us produce more while paying us less. Employers put
employees under a lot of pressure: “Work harder.” “Work faster.” “Spend
less time in the bathroom.” “Do not dawdle or distract your fellow workers
or use the internet for amusement.” In other words, do nothing that strays
from the fundamental purpose of your job in the capitalist workplace: profit
for employers.
Huge damages done to the physical, emotional, and mental health of
employees follow. Work  is  where adults  spend  most  of  their  lives. The
workplace could  support, enable,  and  encourage personal development,
mutually enriching relationships, and  learning from  and  teaching one
another. Yet the human needs for all of those aspects of life, all of those
means to happiness, are rarely served in capitalist workplaces. Depression,
anxiety,  despair,  and  hopelessness often  follow.  Likewise, employees
usually lack  the  time,  energy,  and  money needed to  meet  those  needs
outside the workplace.
The system requires capitalist firms to grow. That drives capitalists to
exploit more: to pay workers less, make them work more, or make them
more productive without increasing wages. When you see a corporation’s
CEO boasting about record profits, they mean your hard work is producing
more value, but your wages are not hitting new highs. The capitalists take
the value that the workers’ labor creates and keep a large part of it for
themselves. In effect, they steal it.
At most jobs, the condition of your employment is that you produce
more by your labor than you get paid for doing it. So, in the capitalist
system, the hard reality is this: no wage or salary earner is paid what they’re
worth. Capitalism means they get paid significantly less. All profit is value
extraction: the worker produces it, and the employer takes it.
“Profit” is the name employers prefer for what they take from the value
their workers’ labor adds. Marx called what employers take the “surplus”—
a word that focuses our attention on what the worker produces that someone
else grabs.

Those who take the surplus from the workers hate to admit that. They
prefer to see it differently. They, therefore, invented the term “profits” to
mean a payment employers make to themselves for something crucial that
they do. They “run the business.” That is the equivalent of slave masters
justifying the surplus they take from slaves’ output as their payment for the
work of “mastering.” It is also the equivalent of feudal lords justifying rents
imposed on their serfs as payments for the crucial task of “lording” over
those serfs.
The revolutionary fact always was and is this: workers can do the work
without masters, lords,  or  employers. In  modern capitalist corporations,
those who take the surplus—boards of directors—have literally nothing to
do  with  the  production of  outputs. They  mostly make  big,  long-term
strategic decisions, give orders, and live luxuriously. A far better system for
workers would entail  cooperatives of  workers running their  enterprises’
production together, rotating tasks among themselves so all can understand
and  democratically run  the  business. This  is  examined  further in  the
upcoming chapter, “What Comes After Capitalism.”
## Why So Many Hate Their Workplaces
At the end of every year, most corporations have a holiday party for all
employees. At a certain point, the CEO (who is also a member of the board
of directors) gets up on a wobbly table and thanks everyone. “You’re all a
great team,” the CEO says, “and I want to thank each and every one of you
for the contributions you made to another successful year here at the XYZ
Corporation.” In capitalism, the employees just thanked are totally excluded
from any participation in deciding what happens to the fruits of their labor
or to the profits generated by their labor.
Capitalism’s rigid hierarchy characterizes nearly every workplace. An
owner or board of directors sits at the top, giving orders to all ranked below
them.  Employees  get  no  vote  in  choosing a  business strategy  for  the
enterprise in which they work and on which they depend. For most workers,
once you set foot in the workplace, you are told where to stand, where to
sit, when you can go to the bathroom, what to do, how to do it, and for how
long. At day’s end, whatever you helped to produce using your brains and
your  muscles immediately belongs to your   employers.  But  they  do
sometimes give you a nice thank you at that party.

The US Census Bureau counts employers as 1 to 3 percent of the US
population: a tiny percent of the whole. Employees, as capitalism’s major
other  class,  comprise, with  their  families, most  of  the  rest.  Employers
typically accumulate wealth and power; employees typically do not. The
resulting social divisions are the cages within which most people must pass
their lives.
If that upsets you, if it eats at you over time, if it feels stressful and
demeaning, it means you are a human being able to face your real situation.
You  understand  why  bar  owners  across America have  window signs
offering “happy hour.” You grasp the signs’ other message of consolation
and understanding: the previous hours of the day at work were not happy.
That “happy hour” is part of a culture. You might call it the culture of
capitalism, and here it is in a nutshell. The workplace is rarely where you
seek,  and  even  more  rarely  where you  will  find,  personal fulfillment,
recognition, enjoyment, relaxation,  conviviality,  friendship, or  closeness.
You might find those goals and joys of life in some corner of a workplace,
maybe during a work break, maybe over lunch, maybe if you sneak around.
But none of them are why you are there, nor are they what the employer
wants out of or for you. Capitalism is disinterested in them. Capitalism
exists to make profits for employers.
The “Do What You Love” Con
The emptiness, drain, and loss of self that happens in capitalist workplaces
has been indirectly admitted even in mainstream neoclassical economics
(the  kind  of  economics taught in  most  schools and  universities).
Neoclassical economists mostly treat  labor  as  intrinsically negative, a
burden, a  “disutility” workers suffer.  They  presume that  labor  is
fundamentally unattractive: not  a  satisfaction, a  gain,  a  relationship
developed, or something learned. Wages are what make work tolerable for
the laborer. Wages are the “plus” (or benefit), while labor is the “negative”
(or cost). The job may be awful, but the wages enable you to go to the mall.
Consumption is the compensation for work.
On that basis, many employers have used the slogan “Work doing what
you love” to entice workers to accept lower wages, as if those low wages
were  necessary or  reasonable since  you  get  to  do  “what you  love.”

Teachers, nurses, nannies, caring professionals, and others are told, “Your
work is your reward.” Employers also use workers’ hopes for better jobs as
a basis for paying them little for the work they actually perform. The term
“intern” describes workers who get little or no pay from employers who
promise to  provide great  letters of  recommendation to  potential future
employers of such underpaid interns.
In still other ways, employers admit the awfulness of the workplaces
they  control and  exploit. Some  of  them  install fitness rooms, institute
“casual Fridays,” or organize occasional pizza parties. These are the in-
house alternatives to “happy hours” at neighborhood bars. For employers,
these are inexpensive outlays to offset job conditions that might otherwise
cause workers to get sick, miss work days, leave for other jobs, or otherwise
undermine employers’ profits. No such additions to workplaces change the
basic  problem: profit-driven workplaces are  mostly enemies of  human
relationships and growth. Our passions for what we love to do are neither
enabled, nor  encouraged, nor  developed in  or  by  capitalist workplaces.
Rather, they are locations of many “unhappy hours” that workers suffer in
capitalist systems, whether consciously or not.
The Ultimate Compensation for Labor Is Consumption
Beyond wages, capitalism’s  ultimate compensation for  the  burden of
working is consumption. In capitalism, most people learn from an early age
that  work  is  your  adult  burden  and  consumption is  its  purpose.
Consumption is to compensate for the frustration of your needs, desires, and
creativity on  the  job.  Feel  bad  on  the  job?  Go  shopping. Want  to  stop
working for a while? Buy a vacation.
In this way, the capitalist gains twice. First, by exploitation, the capitalist
appropriates the excess of the value added by workers’ labor over the wage
paid to those workers. Then, the employer can get us again if and when they
charge us more for goods than it really costs to buy the employer’s output.
Then employers get you twice—as a worker and as a consumer.
Workers, as they fall ever further behind employers in terms of wealth,
income, power, and culture, may accept this reality if they attain an ever-
rising level of personal consumption. Your exploitation is easier to tolerate,
or even forget, when you can afford to go to the movies, buy a new car, or

go to college. Generations of capitalism’s champions have firmly believed
that a secure capitalism is one that delivers a rising standard of consumption
to  its  working classes, because  if  it  doesn’t,  workers will  notice and
challenge the system. For capitalism to succeed (or even survive), two goals
must be achieved: (1) real wages must rise, and (2) workers must believe
that rising consumption is an adequate, appropriate reward for their work.
This is where consumer (“household”) debt comes in. Over the last forty
years, US workers’ wages have barely risen above the rate of inflation. To
keep up with the American dream that was relentlessly advertised to them,
workers had  to  find  rising  purchasing power elsewhere since  their  real
wages were  stagnant. The  solution was  borrowing via  credit  cards,  car
loans, and mortgages (later supplemented by student loans). In effect, what
employers saved by not raising real wages (as they had before 1980) they
then  lent  to  those  same workers. Employers  thus  funded the  borrowing
workers undertook because  employers  stopped raising real  wages.
Employers benefited by constraining real wages, and thus boosting profits,
plus earning interest payments on workers’ rising indebtedness.
The US capitalist system generated record profits over most of the last
forty years. Yet it also left a trail of costs in its wake: rising debt, rising debt
anxiety, and widening income inequality.
## Unemployment: Capitalism’s Cruel Absurdity
Unemployment—being jobless when  you  do  not  want  to  be—follows
capitalism’s cyclical downturns every four to seven years on average. When
unemployment rises, so do depressive disorders, alcoholism, drug abuse,
marital problems, child abuse, and criminal behaviors. What goes down
with  rising  unemployment includes individual workers’  self-esteem,
personal savings, and physical and mental health. This list barely captures
the billions in lost or wasted value and the massive human suffering caused
by capitalism’s recurring unemployment.
It is a profound and enduring inefficiency of capitalism that every four to
seven years, it throws millions of people out of work, often for years.
Employers too suffer from unemployment. Employers know, even if they
don’t  admit  it,  that  the  only  way  they profit  is  if  their  employees are

working. Without the employees, factories, offices, and stores produce no
profits.
Yet unemployment has persisted across capitalism’s history despite its
wasteful, cruel  absurdity.  A  proper,  well-functioning economy  would
connect unemployed  people who  want  and  can  perform work  with  idle
tools, equipment, and raw materials to create socially useful products. After
all, since the unemployed continue to consume, common sense suggests
enabling them to work. However, capitalism reproduces unemployment for
one profitable reason: it scares and thus “disciplines” workers.
Periodic bouts of unemployment teach the working class a basic lesson:
however poor the job, it is better than unemployment. When unemployment
shoots up, workers worry, “Will it hit me too?” Such worry is often as bad
as  unemployment itself,  and  it  motivates workers to  accept otherwise
inadequate conditions and  compensation. Unionized workers have  often
accepted contracts with  lower wages if  they  include job-security
commitments. Employers regularly  threaten workers, individually and
collectively, with dismissal to wring concessions from them.
A major reason for so many bad jobs being accepted is that they are
better than unemployment. No wonder unemployment is allowed to return
so often; it serves a purpose in and for capitalism.
Capitalism and the Individual: Which Shapes Which?
The  extremely conservative economist Milton Friedman celebrated a
private capitalist system. He  wanted the  government to  play  the  most
minimal role  possible in  terms  of  intervening in  the  economy.  Private
capitalist enterprises should manage economic activities (production,
distribution, etc.) and be protected from the government. Nor should they
be vulnerable to popular expectations about their behavior. A capitalist’s
job, he said, was to make money, to profit from that capitalist’s business.
Interpreting Adam Smith, Friedman insisted that if each and every employer
and  employee pursue their  own  personal gain  (wage/salary  for  the
employee, profit  for  the  employer), the  end  result  would be  the  best-
possible economy and society for all of us.
In other words, if I ignore the impact of my actions on everybody else, if
I ignore my community’s needs and instead pursue my own personal gain, it

will all work out for the best for everyone. Is this, as Friedman thought, the
key to social well-being? Or is it a crude and quite imaginary justification
for total selfishness?
Where do our morals and ethics come from? For Friedman they are
innate: persons are born good or not, with original virtue or original sin.
Alternatively,  are  we  shaped by  the  social institutions—the families,
schools, workplaces, communities, religions—into which we are born and
with which we live, grow, and change? Might those institutions help shape
our moral values, sense of self, and relationships with others?
We  need  not  choose—as Friedman did—one or  the  other: that
individuals shape society or that society shapes individuals. Both can be
true:  individuals, profoundly shaped by  their  social and  natural
environments, also  react  back  upon  and  shape  those  environments. The
world may well be a place of endless interactions, both among individuals
and between them and society. The interactions change both sides; that in
turn  changes their  interactions,  producing that  endless process we  call
history.
Anyone who  puts  forward capital—money—to hire  workers, and  set
them in motion with raw materials, tools, and equipment to secure a profit
is thereby defined as a capitalist. It is their actions that define them as such.
They  occupy a  position (employer) within the  capitalist system of
production. The goal of that position—as dictated by how the system works
—becomes the goal of persons who wish to occupy the employer position.
Employers may  say  that  their  goals  are  lofty  social  ideals  of  all  sorts.
However,  down  in  the  “real  world,” where the  capitalist system  is  the
established mode of  producing and  distributing goods and  services,
capitalists have  one  dominant, ultimate, bottom-line goal:  profit. Profit
maximization gives each capitalist the best possible chance of staying in the
position of employer, rather than sliding down into the employee position,
or worse.
Capitalists need not be personally greedy, though some surely are. Nor
are they necessarily “bad” or “good” as people, as individuals. However, in
their position as capitalists/employers, they need to act in certain ways or
lose  that  position. The  system  dictates profit maximization as  the
employer’s best shot at keeping their position. The system sets capitalists in
competition with one another; the activity of each threatens the others. As
the laws of the jungle drive animals to struggle and literally eat one another,

so do the laws of capitalist competition drive ruthless, aggressive behavior
of one capitalist against the others. And, of course, the laws of the capitalist
system shape the individual employers and employees, much as the laws of
the jungle shape the animals living in it.
## Individualism Gone Wrong
At its birth, capitalism’s enthusiasts claimed the system institutionalized the
individual freedom to aspire and achieve without interference or constraint
from government or church. Through capitalism, individuals could break
out of the rigid social roles the previous society had imposed on the vast
majority of people (slaves and masters, serfs and lords). Capitalism would
enable each  individual’s  skills,  ambitions, and  energies  to  bring  them
positions in society never before possible for the masses of people. Previous
societies and  their  representatives, especially strong states, were  the
enemies. Capitalism would vanquish them  and  liberate individuals from
their rule. “Individualism” was capitalism’s banner (which is one reason
“socialism” became its great adversary).
Over the last two centuries, individualism grew into a major philosophy
of capitalism. It led many to disregard how societies shape the individuals
raised within  them. Many forms of  individualism thus  stipulate that
individuals have certain “innate qualities” that create and shape society. The
close association of capitalism and individualism, unsurprisingly, provoked
capitalism’s  critics to  take  the  name  “socialism.” Such  critics tend  to
emphasize how society shapes individuals.
Capitalism has often compromised the individualist promises made at its
beginnings. Consider our  society’s  deep  psychic wound of  loneliness.
Capitalism breeds many individuals who feel unjustly, bitterly cut off from
any  community.  Trained to  think  that  their  individual characteristics
determine their social positions, employees often blame their positions in
capitalist society upon  themselves, upon  their  individual qualities.
Consequent brooding undermines interpersonal communication and trust.
Overcoming such  tendencies sufficiently to  combine with  others in
voluntary collective action, even when democratically organized, becomes
very  difficult  and  thus  rare.  On  the  other  side,  employers indulge the
individualist view  that  they  “made themselves.” Denying their  own
socialization, they slide into feelings of innate superiority based on what

employers often think are their “inherent” qualities and the lack of them
among employees. Feelings, sensibilities, and aspirations are shaped by all
the encounters in our lives. The particularities of the capitalist economic
system—and especially its core structural division between employers and
employees—influence many  of  those  encounters. Among the  effects  of
capitalism and individualism are the widespread loneliness people feel, the
weakness and fragility of their connections with others. Even Plato and
Aristotle, thousands of  years  ago,  addressed a  parallel undermining of
community when  they  criticized markets. They  believed that  markets
undermined what  they  called “social cohesion,” what  we  might term
“community” or “solidarity.” Their criticisms apply to capitalism as well
since it expanded and celebrated markets far beyond what earlier systems
had done. Critics of markets have long argued that they lead participants to
ask, “How little can I give up, for how much can I get in return?” In market
exchanges, others become instruments for our gain. Market relationships
are  transactional, adversarial, and  self-serving. They  weaken social
solidarity and produce a deeply lonely population.
Capitalism by now has generated an extreme individualism that divides
us. As children mature, they are told that the pursuit of personal profit is
natural. We are given rags-to-riches stories to strengthen our motivation to
pursue wealth no  matter what  happens to  others. We  are  warned  about
trusting others, about their ulterior motives, and their gains from cheating
us. Individualist ideological blinders prevent many from asking how the
system into which we were born might be a key problem and system change
might be a key solution.
The ironic contradiction of individualism is that it leads to loss of respect
for  many  individuals. Individualism often  discredits the  individual who
does not live up to impossible expectations. It then deprives individuals of
both  their  own  self-support and  that  of  family,  friends, and  coworkers
around them. Individuals who do not realize capitalism’s role in their lives
often suffer loneliness instead of collaborating with others to go beyond
capitalism and its destructive individualism.
Capitalism Trains You to Accept the Suffering of Others
This unchecked individualism also trains people to accept and justify the
horrific consequences  of  capitalism, because those  are  blamed on  its

victims.
Capitalism, Marx theorized, displays “uneven development.” While it
generates great wealth, it also generates great poverty. For every part of a
major capitalist city that is rich, another is poor. In the US, the dynamic
center of  capitalist growth was  first  New  England, then the  industrial
Midwest, then the Southwest, in a pattern of uneven development that saw
each of those regions fall after they had grown. In the US and elsewhere,
endless “anti-poverty policies” and “wars on poverty” have failed to end it.
In the 1970s, Detroit was a center of US capitalism, with a population of
nearly two million. It paid workers better than in most parts of the US;
those workers had strong unions. It was the global center of the automobile
industry, a vital part of capitalism. Today, Detroit has been “undeveloped”
by  capitalism. Its  population has  declined to  less  than  seven  hundred
thousand, and vast sections of the city are impoverished or abandoned.
Capitalism’s profit drive shifted investible funds from Detroit to other
locations where automobile production was more profitable. That happened
partly because those  locations  lacked Detroit’s  strong union  and  anti-
capitalist movements among autoworkers and those movements’ allies. Yet
alternative narratives—that Detroit’s demise was somehow its own fault—
survive and,  in  many  areas, prevail. Individualist accounts blame the
victims: the workers did not work hard; business owners didn’t innovate
enough; wages or  wage  demands  were  too  high;  local  politicians  were
corrupt. For the last forty years, as Detroit descended into a permanent
crisis, very little was done to stop and reverse the decline. Few criticized
capitalism and its profit-driven, uneven development as a main cause of
Detroit’s  demise (an  early  exception was Marvin Surkin and  Dan
Georgakas, Detroit: I  Do Mind Dying; A  Study in Urban Revolution, 3rd
ed., Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2012 [1975]).
The same applies to countries. The dynamic “center” of capitalism also
developed unevenly as it moved from England (seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries) to western Europe to North America and Japan. More recently it
has moved on to China, India, and Brazil. Regions built up by capitalism’s
movement coexist with regions declining because capital accumulation, and
thus capitalist development, have moved on.
In capitalism’s long commitment to colonialism, each capitalist “center”
developed on the basis of wealth stolen from the colonized “periphery” and
labor  exploited there  (or  as  immigrants inside the  colonizer country).

Capitalism relied on labor and resources drawn from across the globe, but it
concentrated the  resulting wealth in  a  few  colonial centers. Uneven
development is built into capitalism’s structure. Capitalism’s neocolonial
phase continues uneven development into our era.
Capitalism conditions many to believe that in nature or in the economy,
when something goes up, something else must go down. People who might
otherwise celebrate  and  welcome an  end  to  poverty resist  doing  so  by
means of changing the economic system. That resistance is informed partly
by an individualism that blames poverty on the poor. Anti-poverty programs
thus often focus on changing the poor individuals, rather than changing the
system that impoverishes them. That resistance is also partly fueled by the
belief that helping the poor out of poverty will necessarily press others
down into poverty. One part of the working class fears that help for another
part will come at the first part’s expense. White workers fear assistance to
Black workers will come at white workers’ expense. Since employers gain
from such beliefs, they often repeat and exaggerate them.
Recently,  right-wing politicians often mobilize people against
immigrants around the world, using the argument that aiding them would
necessarily cost  nonimmigrant workers. All  around the  world  there  are
anxieties born of capitalism and the inequalities it perpetuates: if I have
something, helping others will be at my expense.
Such fears shape how we interact with others, and what we consider
acceptable treatment  of  other  people. Causes of  those  fears  include
capitalism. Its uneven development shapes those fears.
Ignoring how capitalism works—how capitalists (the few) take surpluses
produced by  others (the  many)—serves to  exonerate capitalism’s
responsibility for  its  negative social  effects.  By  their  taboo  on  blaming
capitalism, the system’s defenders foster the blaming of those effects on
something or someone else. Thus the poverty and misery of the Global
South  is  more  easily  tolerated  if  seen  as  the  effect  of  “other”  cultures,
inadequate work ethics, or corrupt politicians. By doing nothing about the
capitalist system, uneven development continues in all its forms (unequal
income and wealth distributions, cyclical instability, politics corrupted by
wealth, etc.).
Provoked to  protest these  horrors, individuals learn,  eventually,  to
understand them as social problems rooted in specific economic systems.
That understanding enables the social movements that challenge capitalism

as a key cause of those horrors. Challenges evolve into finding solutions
that overcome capitalism’s “uneven development” by replacing capitalism
itself with a different economic system.
Living in the Contradictions of Capitalism
We  live  in  a  capitalist system,  with  all  the  contradictions and  flaws
discussed in this book. We therefore accommodate capitalism in a thousand
ways, consciously and unconsciously, as life in any system requires. Yet we
can also seek, form, and share a critical understanding of capitalism. Doing
so  offsets  our  necessary accommodation with  movement toward social
change beyond capitalism.
If I could give this book’s readers any advice, it would be to talk about
the real contradictions with which we live. Understand and recognize the
accommodations you’ve made to capitalism and why you have done so.
Admitting them and their costs to you and others can lead directly to hoping
for and believing in the possibility of a better system, a better way to live.
We can do better than capitalism, just as people like us long ago insisted
that they could do better than slavery, feudalism, monarchy, and so on. But
it will take time, energy, and resources to move society in that direction.
The word “utopia” defines certain dreams and imaginary futures that
people have  always experienced  or  felt:  of  better conditions, better
relationships, better lives. It is important for one’s mental health to have
utopian fantasies,  even  as  you  also  recognize the  distance and  tension
between the  life  you  actually live  and  the  utopia you  dream of.  Such
recognition can  bring  that  utopia closer.  Utopian visions were  always
important parts of social movements to change economic systems in the
past. They are important in the same way now.
Criticism of capitalism is not nihilism, not a simple rejection of what is.
Understanding capitalism critically has mostly been accompanied by the
dream, the movement, the gesture, the hope, the belief: we can do better.
People made it better in the past and can again. Employees are capitalist
society’s masses, like slaves and serfs in slavery and feudalism. All those
masses have  been  trapped within systems. All  have  sought escape or
revolution, and eventually achieved them. And you?

From the basics of the capitalist class structure—organizing workplaces
into a minority that controls and exploits a majority—to all its influences
upon the economy, politics, and culture, a conclusion emerges. Capitalism
shapes us all in countless ways. If the current social system offers a life
with many problems, instabilities, and injustices, then an honest logic leads
us to question and even challenge the role of capitalism in causing and
sustaining the difficult conditions of our lives.
Capitalism is not the only cause of the conditions of our lives; no one
thing ever is. But capitalism cannot be excluded from among the causes,
and it cannot be excused from blame, as so many try so hard to do. This
book reestablishes capitalism’s role in the issues we face today. That is
urgently necessary now, after Cold War decades of a near-absolute taboo on
criticizing capitalism coupled with  deeply instilled fears  of  demonized
alternatives. If  we  grasp  our  suffering’s  relationship to  capitalism and
understand capitalism critically, we have the ability to decide that system
change is one key step on the road to doing better in the future.

## CHAPTER 7
## What Comes After Capitalism
conomic system changes have happened before. All  past  economic
systems were born, evolved over time, and then passed away as other
systems emerged to replace them. All past societies have had people
who thought about changing their lives for the better, and who came to
understand their society and its economic system (or systems) critically.
Those people then got together in social movements aimed at transitioning
from the system they had to one they thought could work better. There were
always people whose attitude toward the existing system was, “This is the
best  we  can  do.”  There  were  always others who  said,  “This  needs  to
change.” This  difference and  division agitates today’s  capitalism, too.
Capitalism is always changing, but for long periods, the basic system has
retained certain features. Those consistent features make up what we mean
by “the capitalist system”; they are how capitalism is defined in this book.
The central feature is the organization of workplace participants into a small
minority exploiting and directing a large majority. Across an infinity of
changes in capitalism, the basic contours of employer versus employee have
endured.
That  employer-versus-employee structure is  a  key,  core  problem of
capitalism. To  go  beyond capitalism, then,  means going beyond that
structure. It  means rethinking and  reorganizing our  workplaces, our
factories, offices, stores, farms, households, and so on. What can emerge
out of capitalism’s decline are new, differently organized workplaces. We
can accomplish that reorganization as the basis for a different, better society
and different, better lives for all of us.
Imagining a Better Way

To  discuss where society might  go  is  risky.  No  one  knows the  future.
History is always open-ended. Looking back, it seems clear that system
changes occurred when  and  mostly because existing systems  were  no
longer tolerable. At  those  times, there  was  relatively little  clarity or
agreement as to what the next system would entail, beyond a few vague
basics. But that did not stop system changes from occurring.
Slaves who found slavery intolerable sought “freedom.” Serfs sought
“liberty.” Many others added “equality,” “fraternity,” and “democracy.” It
wasn’t clear what such terms meant concretely until, by trial and error—and
luck—a new system congealed in place of the old one. Slaves could not
predict the  post-slavery future,  nor  could  serfs  predict the  post-feudal
future. Today, employees cannot precisely predict the post-capitalist future.
Yet, once again, the demand for change in an intolerable present system is
making social  change happen.  However,  there  are  always some  whose
particular ideas  influence the  construction of  the  next  system. Moving
beyond capitalism is no exception. A good part of this book uses the work
of Marx and Marxists because their tradition pioneered and accumulated
system-focused criticism of capitalism and also practical experiments in
constructing post-capitalist systems.
Many of the Marxist experiments to construct post-capitalist systems
over  the  last  century were  complex, mixing different  elements  despite
almost always choosing the  name  “socialism” for  what  they  did.  The
mixtures included positive achievements on  which to  build  and  big
mistakes to  avoid repeating. The  defining feature of  most  socialist
experiments was a focus on the state as a regulator of, or replacement for,
private capitalists. While those attempts made progress in defining what
collective consumption is and how it might be organized, they failed to
move much beyond the  capitalist organization of  workplaces into
employers and employees.
From the moderate socialisms of Scandinavia and Western Europe (with
the  state  as  regulator of  private enterprises) to  the  Soviet Union–type
socialisms (with  the  state  as  owner/operator of  enterprises) and  all  the
hybrid socialisms in between (e.g., the People’s Republic of China), one
basic  reality stands out:  the  basic  capitalist organization/structure of
employer versus employee remained across them all, even as the precise
nature of who occupies the minority position of employer often changed.
Private individuals as  employers changed to  state  officials (individuals

occupying positions within a state apparatus) as employers. In short, largely
private capitalism changed into state capitalism or hybrid combinations of
both kinds. The “who” changed, but the structured positions of employer
and employee did not. Were these socialist experiments in going beyond
capitalism flawed or incomplete because of the survival of the capitalist
structure within them? This book answers yes.
What, then, is to be done?
The Case for Worker Cooperatives
Cooperatives (and  specifically worker cooperatives) are  a  critical
component of building a more sustainable, equitable, and democratic future.
Worker co-ops represent a crucial next step in doing better than capitalism
—a real alternative to it.
A co-op is a business or workplace that is directed and operated by all its
members on the principle of “one person, one vote.” There is no employer
(owner, board of directors, or CEO) making basic decisions (what, how, and
where to  produce, and  what  to  do  with  the  surplus or  profits) while
excluding the  employees. Worker  co-ops operate through democratic
control by  all  their  members. Members’  values and  goals  govern. They
decide democratically what priorities will determine their basic decisions
about their workplace. Typical priorities include making workplaces into
egalitarian, sustainable, and joyful communities where human relationships
and individuals’ personal development and growth can flourish. Worker co-
ops’ priorities may include profit maximization, but always as only one
among many other equally or more important goals.
The  management structures and  day-to-day operations of  co-ops can
vary greatly according to the needs and desires of the co-op members. Co-
ops exist in many varieties, including worker, consumer, producer, sales,
purchasing, and multi-stakeholder configurations, among others. Each of
these structures matches people’s  particular needs to  a  particular
collaborative approach.
In  a  worker-co-op-based economic  system, the  employer/employee
difference disappears. It no longer organizes workplaces such as factories,
offices,  farms, and  stores. Instead, for  each  participant in  a  workplace,
going to work becomes functioning within a democratic community.

In  that  community,  carefully prepared information relevant to  basic
workplace decisions is distributed to all well in advance. Workers are paid
to study that information; it is part of their work, their job description. All
workers’ inputs are welcomed, all options openly debated and voted on. In
terms of Marx’s notion of the surplus generated by productive workers, in
worker co-ops it is those workers themselves who appropriate and distribute
the surplus generated in the workplace. No separate class of employers does
that. Thus, a democratic worker co-op represents a step outside and beyond
capitalism’s  employer/employee  structure. Worker co-ops overcome
capitalism’s class divide. The workers control the full fruits of their labor.
Worker  co-ops already exist  in  modern societies (as  they  also  did
throughout much  of  history). Today,  they  coexist alongside capitalist
enterprises. In modern capitalism, they form the embryonic beginnings of a
possible future economic system. They played parallel roles in pre-capitalist
economic systems, too. As those systems declined, worker co-ops might
have  been  the  next  system that  emerged  from  a  prior  system’s  decline.
However, in reality, other, different systems emerged (in Europe, feudalism
out of slavery’s decline, and capitalism out of feudalism’s decline). There is
no necessary sequence of change.
Capitalism’s decline opens the space for the next system to emerge.
Whether that will be a worker-co-op-based system or not depends on the
people making the transition. Where do such agents of transition wish to go
in terms of organizing their economy? If workplace democratization is high
on  their  agenda, the  hierarchical  divisions of  slavery,  feudalism, and
capitalism will be what they avoid. Worker co-ops may well, then, be where
they take societies in transition.
Worker co-ops offer democracy
As residents of our city, state, and nation, we have at least a vote for the
mayor, governor, or president; but in capitalist factories, stores, and offices,
comparable voting is not allowed. There, the CEO often functions like a
king.
Worker co-ops end such mini-monarchies inside capitalist corporations.
If  societies have  a  commitment  to  democracy,  then  democracy surely
belongs first and foremost where most adults spend most of their adult life
—at  work. Yet  in  the US  and  most  other  capitalist nations, from  their

beginnings, democracy was always excluded from most workplaces. No
wonder CEOs’ speeches praising democracy ring so hollow.
Democratic workplaces are just the beginning. Coops can be schools of
democracy, training masses of people in how to use, protect, and improve
democratic procedures and values. Workers trained in democracy at work
can inspire and train others to install democratic decision-making in all
other areas of society. In today’s so-called democratic nations, democracy
merely means annual mass  voting for  political authorities. Even  if
corporations and the rich did not manipulate such elections (as they do
now), real democracy requires much more than such elections. Democratic
workplaces give  people a  daily  experience with  democracy.  That  will
develop the appetite to have a comparably real democracy in politics as
well: everyday, ongoing democratic inputs, not merely annual elections.
Truly  democratic societies require democratized workplaces. They
always did.
Co-ops are driven by more than profit
In a worker co-op, the enterprise has multiple goals. While it seeks revenue
greater than  costs, its  members also  want  job  security,  safe  work
environments, socially meaningful work, and  jobs  that  encourage and
support friendships and individual workers’ learning and growth. Together
with  other stakeholders (for  example, the  residential communities
surrounding workplaces), worker co-op  members consider their  profits,
their  wages,  the  social  and  natural environments they  live  in,  and  their
personal and collective development all together. It is an institutionalized
way  of  having more  objectives  than  profit and  making decisions
democratically, with all stakeholders and their diverse workplace objectives
included.
Removing profit as the single motive of an enterprise can also encourage
innovation differently,  even  more  so,  than  capitalism usually does.
Capitalist businesses will cut their labor costs, change job descriptions, and
fire  employees whenever it  serves  their  profitability. They  will  likewise
change the products they market, the technologies they deploy, the locations
they choose, and the advertising they buy to maximize profitability.
In  capitalism, if  a  new  technology automates the  employee’s  work,
making production more  efficient and  the  enterprise more  profitable,

employees have  good  reasons to  worry  about  their  job  security and  to
oppose the  new,  efficient technology.  Worker  co-ops could respond
differently to  technical change. Instead of  replacing workers, a  better
machine might replace half of the workers’ work time. Technology would
then  enhance  workers’  leisure rather  than  employers’  profits.  Which is
better  for  the  long  run  of  each  enterprise is  an  open  question. Are  the
workers exhausted, and therefore in need of more time for friends, family,
and  leisure? Which is  better  for  society: more  profits for  the  employer
minority or more leisure for the employee majority? What could the co-op
do with more profits? Worker co-ops, which serve the needs and desires of
their majority through democratic process, would be far less excited, or
able, to fire their companions for a profit. Worker co-ops would be far more
sensitive to many of those social and environmental costs of production,
and  far  more  likely  to  include them  in  the  calculations informing their
business decisions. Worker-owners have a commitment and loyalty toward
their co operative workplace rarely found among employees constantly told
by “higher-ups” what to do at work. Why should we be surprised when
employees care less about a business that exploits them and treats them like
a disposable tool for profit? Workers who direct their own co-op businesses
are engaged in democracy for which they feel responsible and loyal. Worker
co-op members  are  more  likely to  go  that  extra  step  that  capitalist
employees do not. No wonder research (such as that by Professor Virginie
Perotin of Leeds University in the UK) on comparable businesses that differ
only by their structures—capitalist versus worker co-op—shows the latter
to be more efficient and last longer.
Co-ops are a force of equality
With direct democracy and a structure that elevates priorities such as saving
the planet, the quality of human life, and work-life balance, cooperatives
can be a driving force for equality. In 2014, a survey revealed that the
average US worker believed the typical CEO-to-worker pay ratio in the US
is 30:1. The reality was much starker: CEOs got paid $354 for every $1 a
typical employee makes. The workers of Amazon and Tesla would never
vote to approve paying Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk what they receive today
from these companies. Workers would never vote to pay themselves an
hourly wage so low that they must get second and third jobs, while top

managers and  major  shareholders take  enough to  buy  megayachts. The
same people who guessed the CEO-to-worker pay ratio was 30:1 said their
desired ratio would be 4.6:1. The inequalities of our current system would
not survive votes by democratic majorities of worker-coop enterprises.
Notions that  hierarchical, top-down power and  decision-making  are
necessary or  natural will  disappear from  the  economy just  like  the  old
notions that society needed a king who worked directly with God. Working
people will come to understand themselves no longer as akin to slaves,
serfs,  or  employees. Rather,  they  will  self-identify as  equally important
members of  their  residential communities and  likewise their  workplace
communities. In  worker co-ops, they  will  exercise their  democratic
capabilities by  designing and  deciding the  enterprise’s  future alongside
others as parts of everyone’s job descriptions.
Of course, cooperatives have and will face growing pains in this process.
Equality will not be perfect or instantaneous simply due to a switch to
cooperativism. But, just as capitalism was an evolving improvement from
feudalism, cooperatives will evolve as well.
Transitions Are Normal and Take Time. We’re Not Done
## Evolving
The transition from capitalism to a worker-co-op-based economic system is
already underway. Over a long time and in many places, powerful social
forces brought worker co-ops into existence. The flaws and difficulties of
slavery, feudalism, and capitalism pushed workers to imagine workplace
alternatives, including democratic co-ops.
Yet  transitions are  overdetermined by  everything happening in  their
economic, political, and cultural environments. As such, they are filled with
contradictions and change unevenly. Transitions happen here but not there.
Sometimes the transitions are quick; at other times they drag and delay.
Some democratic enterprises might not  understand themselves as
transitioning systems, while others focus on it.
Cooperatives of all kinds have long, complex histories. In many parts of
the world today, they have carved out acceptable places, often on condition
of  remaining relatively small,  within otherwise capitalist economies.
Worker co-ops, and those who advocate for them, rarely confront capitalism

explicitly, as the representation of an alternative economic system. They
likely fear capitalism’s probable reaction. Nonetheless, this confrontation
could take many forms.
More labor unions could add the establishment of worker co-ops to their
strategies when  challenging capital. When employers demand workers’
concessions by threatening to close or relocate enterprises abroad, unions
could refuse and instead establish worker co-ops.
Localities in  the US  could  use  the  legal  right  of  eminent domain to
purchase private property for a “community purpose”, such as organizing
and  supporting worker co-ops. Such  community purposes could  be—as
they historically have been—to obtain land and other resources for worker
co-ops as part of strategies to mitigate unemployment and poverty.
High school, college, and university curricula could include lessons and
discussions about how the US might do better than capitalism and offer
practical courses for  establishing worker co-ops. Business schools and
college economics departments could  integrate alternatives to  capitalism
into their curricula.
A  politically encouraged form  of  transition could see  progressive
political forces ally  with  co-ops  in  systems of  mutual support.  Co-op
organizations could be crucial connectors between an organized political
left and workers’ daily struggles inside enterprises. The worker cooperatives
and their community supporters could provide support, labor power, and
financial help to left political initiatives and campaigns. In return, the left
could  mobilize demonstrations,  local  ongoing meetings, and  electoral
campaigns to secure legislative frameworks, capital, and markets needed for
allied worker-co-op partners to thrive and grow. Such partnerships could
establish a  sustained and  sustainable economic base  for  left  politics
everywhere.
For transitions, it would help for the worker co-op sectors of today’s
economies to  grow. Then,  others can  view  worker co-ops in  action: by
learning how others experience life and labor within worker co-ops, by
buying products from worker co-ops, and by living in communities whose
economies include a significant worker-co-op sector. For people to make
informed, democratic choices about capitalist versus cooperative
workplaces, a functioning worker-co-op sector needs to be part of their
environment. When people have and understand options, they make better
individual and also social decisions.

For transition to a democratic economy, we need cooperative structures
and models, in theory and in practice, as so many paths forward. The more
of them we build, the more ways for people to think about and experience
that transition. Political movements and parties must speak about and fight
for the political changes needed to establish and grow cooperatives in all
sectors.
Transition will follow from alliances of capitalism’s victims and critics
as they pursue two conjoint projects: (1) to increase the social presence of
alternative economic systems (worker co-ops) within a declining capitalism,
and (2) to organize victims and critics of capitalism alongside members of
worker co-ops into  a  combined political force  committed to  dispelling
capitalism’s myths and their hold on people. This political movement would
offer solutions to capitalism’s problems that include basic system change
and transition to a better society.
Moving on from Capitalism
It is a critical time in human history. The effects of capitalism’s inequality,
instability, and inadequate response to climate change are converging into
disasters. This will continue if we keep being led by a small minority of
people interested, above all, in maintaining the profit-driven status quo that
benefits them. Capitalism’s  last  three  centuries showed us  that  the
fundamental changes we need proved impossible within the boundaries of
the system.
In US  media, classrooms, and  governance, public discourse largely
ignores how the capitalist class structure of production contributes to the
intertwined declines of the US empire and its economy. No policy aimed at
class change is permitted by the small minority of people who sit at the top
of  our  society (at  the  peaks  of  our  corporate organizations,  as  well  as
Republican and Democratic ones). Without knowing about class-focused
policies, the public cannot think about or debate them. For capitalists, that is
the  point:  keep  class  change away  by  keeping its  possibilities and
advantages out of sight and mind. To offset that is what this book attempts.
We cannot expect the capitalist system’s mounting problems to vanish by
themselves, as if magically, or by the action of our “leaders.” The latter is a
big part of the problems we face—a very small minority that deludes itself

and the population as a whole. This minority cannot face the roots of its
multiplying failures in  capitalism itself. It  falls  to  us  to  deal  with
capitalism’s  divided, and  divisive, class  structure of  production. Serious
attempts at  basic  social change require that  we  understand capitalism
critically and act accordingly.
Capitalism, surplus, and  class  are  crucial issues. The  campaign to
democratize today’s enterprises addresses all those issues at a key point of
their connection. That campaign is a key class struggle of our time, the
practical fruit of understanding capitalism critically.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The dynamic center of  capitalism is  abandoning the United States and,
more broadly,  the G7. It  is  relocating to  China and the BRICS. That
relocation is affecting capitalism everywhere. Like every empire before, the
American empire  that dominated the world economy over the century
ending in  2015 is  now in  its period of  decline. To  understand what this
means for the future of capitalism and what comes after capitalism in both
areas, it  is  important to understand the capitalist system without the
distortions imposed on so many understandings by the post-1945 Cold War
and its continuing legacies.
The capitalist economic system—where production is organized around
the dichotomy of  employers and employees—was born out of  different
systems, evolves, and will pass away into another different system. In that
process, capitalism replicates what happened to each and every other
economic system in human history.  Thus capitalism carries within it
multiple traces of previous, other systems just as it also develops the seeds
and components of subsequent,  different systems. This book seeks to
capture the traces and seeds among the many qualities of capitalism driving
the historical movement of our time beyond the capitalism we inherited.

## ABOUT HAYMARKET BOOKS
Haymarket Books is a radical, independent, nonprofit book publisher based
in Chicago. Our mission is to publish books that contribute to struggles for
social and economic justice. We strive to make our books a vibrant and
organic part of social movements and the education and development of a
critical, engaged, and internationalist left.
We take inspiration and courage from our namesakes, the Haymarket
Martyrs, who  gave  their  lives  fighting for  a  better  world. Their  1886
struggle for the eight-hour day—which gave us May Day, the international
workers’ holiday—reminds workers around the world that ordinary people
can organize and struggle for their own liberation. These struggles—against
oppression, exploitation, environmental devastation, and  war—continue
today across the globe.
Since our founding in 2001, Haymarket has published more than nine
hundred titles. Radically independent, we seek to drive a wedge into the
risk-averse world of corporate book publishing. Our authors include Angela
Y. Davis, Arundhati Roy, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, Eve Ewing, aja monet,
