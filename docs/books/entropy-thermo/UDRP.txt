Abstract. United Digital Reserve Protocol (UDRP) is a programmable reserve and settlement fabric
on which sovereign CBDCs can be issued, collateralized, settled and netted against one another
while remaining fully sovereign. UDRP does not replace national currencies. It standardizes how
they interoperate. UDRP is built around three layers. First, a neutral reserve asset, Universe Dollar
(UVD), provides a common collateral and settlement bridge anchored in verifiable digital collateral
and enforced by cryptography. Second, each jurisdiction issues its own CBDC as a sovereign module
that inherits UVD grade settlement while preserving domestic control over privacy, fees, capital
controls, lending permissions and tax policy. Third, a net settlement engine enables corridor level
clearing across jurisdictions with protocol native rules for tariffs, sanctions and exposure limits.
For citizens and normal users, UDRP is experienced through a single consumer interface. Users
verify identity with a passport, are cryptographically bound to a sovereign identity root and can
acquire UVD by locking collateral via the UVD system. From there, they can hold UVD, hold any
participating sovereign CBDC, convert between them and spend through a card layer that routes
payments across UVD and CBDCs while applying sovereign tax logic automatically. Taxes can be
instant, periodic or zero, configurable by jurisdiction, making compliance simpler while preserving
democratic accountability. UDRP is designed to be neutral between nations, enforceable without
trusting intermediaries and fair at scale. It assumes a multipolar world, rejects veto based empire
dynamics and places every participant under the same structural constraints. The aim is a settlement
standard that can outlive cycles, lower friction, reduce extractive privilege and allow a global economy
to coordinate without forcing humanity to crown a single issuer.

1. Introduction

1.1 The problem: sovereign money is becoming digital without becoming interoperable

As money digilizes, countries are converging on CBDCs and regulated tokenized deposits. These
systems can be efficient domestically yet remain fragmented internationally. Each new CBDC risks
becoming a walled garden connected to others by political discretion and legacy correspondent rails.

When cross border settlement remains discretionary, trade and capital flow inherit the weaknesses of
the old system: slow setilement, opaque fees, asymmetric enforcement and periodic weaponization. A
world with many CBDCs but no common settlement fabric can become more brittle than the world it
replaces.

UDRP is a proposal to standardize interoperation without dissolving sovereignty. Each country
keeps ils own currency and domestic control. What changes is the settlement layer: interoperable,
programmable, verifiable, and neutral.
1.2 The goal: sovereignty al home, fairness between nations, dignity for citizens

UDRP is engineered around three goals:

1. Sovereign control. Every juriadiction defines tts own CBDC parameters and remains responsible
for its domestic outcomes.

2. Newtral settlement. Cross border settlement becomes rule based rather than discretionary, mediated
throwrh a neutral reserve layer.

3. Human scale wsability. Citizens can save, transact and move value globally without burcawcratic
complexity, while still meeting legal obligations of their jurisdiction.

1.3 What UDKP is and is mot

UDRP is a protocol standard for sovereign digital money. It is mot a single world currency. ILis nol a
supranational central bank. It is nota plationm thal removes states. [tis a settlement fabric that makes
slate money interoperable on clear and veritable terms.

2. System Overview

2.1 Three layers
UDRP is composed of three structural layers:
1. UVD reserve layer. A neutral reserve assct that functions as collateral, settlement bridge and

reference unit.

2. Sovereign CBC modules. One CBD per jurisdiction, implemented as a UDRP compliant
module with configurable parameters.

3. Net settlement engine. A corridor aware clearmg layer that nets obligations between jurisdictions
and applies policy matrices such as tariffs and sanctions.

22 Key design constraints

UDRP is designed under the following constraints:

1. No boss of sovercignity. Domestic policy remains domestic.

2. Protecel level enforceability. Rules must be executable, not rhetorical.

3. Neutral between nations. No single issuer gets structural privilege in setthement.
4.

Privacy by default. Citizens are not globally surveilled.

Targeted accountability. [lictt actors can be investigated without blanket transparency.

Symmetry. Governments and institutions operate under the same cryptographic regime as cilixens.
3. UVD as the Neutral Reserve Layer

3.1 Role of UVD inside UDRP

UVD functions as the common collateral and settlement bridge.

Conceptually, UVD is the neutral unit thal sits between sovereign CBDCs when setilement requires a
shared reference. Countries remain free to price and value their currency domestically. UDRP only
standardizes how settlement is computed and finalized across corridors.

3.2 Citizen access to UVD

In the consumer interface, users can acquire UVD through a deterministic and auditable minting
process:

1. User funds the account by card, bank transfer or direct BTC transfer.
2. System acquires BTC and locks it under the UVD mechanism.

3. UVD is issued to the user, with yield dynamics defined by the UVD monetary design.

The UVD layer is intended to be neutral and globally accessible. It becomes the reserve asset that
citizens hold for cross border value storage and the bridge asset that jurisdictions use for settlement.

4. Sovereign CBDCs as UDRP Modules

4.1 One currency per jurisdiction

Each jurisdiction issues ils own CBDC as a UDRP compliant module.

This preserves sovereignty and prevents a single global currency [rom substituting domestic money.
Citizens remain obligated to use their local CBDC for domestic payments and taxes as determined by
their jurisdiction.

4.2 Sovereign parameters

A sovereign CBDC module is defined by a parameter set. The purpose is not to force identical policies,
but to define a standard interface through which policies are enforced.

Core parameter families include:

* Privacy policy. Default privacy level, disclosure thresholds, domestic audit logic.

* Fees. Transfer fees, conversion fees, corridor fees.

« Capital controls. Outbound limits, corridor restrictions, residency rules.

* Credit permissions. Whether lending markets can use the CBDC, collateral constraints.

* Tax logic. Instant, periodic, progressive or zero rate rules tied to passport identily.
4.3 The sovereignty invariant

UDRP enforces a single invariant: every sovereign module must be explicit. Parameters must be
machine readable, public and versioned. Sovereignty is preserved not by secrecy but by clarity.

5. Net Settlement Engine

5.1 Corridor based settlement

Cross border settlement occurs across corridors, where a corridor represents a pair of jurisdictions or a
multilateral group.

For each corridor, UDRP defines:

* Eligible assets for settlement
* Netling windows and exposure limits
« Tariff and sanction rules

* Collateral requirements and haircuts

5.2 Netting

Netting reduces unnecessary value movement. Instead of settling every transaction gross, the system
can compule net obligations over a window, then settle the net.

This reduces liquidity strain, lowers fees and improves slability under stress.

5.3 Tariffs and sanctions at the protocol level

UDRP allows corridor policies to include tariffs and sanctions.

This does not create new sanctions power. It encodes the existing reality thal countries apply tariffs
and sanctions, but makes those rules explicit, deterministic and enforceable at the settlement layer.

The result is clarity: if a corridor is restricted, it is restricted by published policy, not by hidden
intermediaries.

6. Identity Binding and Citizen Experience

6.1 Passport anchored identity

Citizens are identified through passport verification and bound to a sovereign identity root. This
binding determines which tax logic and compliance obligations apply.

This structure enables the core promise: domestic obligations can be enforced without making every
transaction globally public.
6.2 Consumer interface overview

The consumer product presents a unified experience:

* Hold and earn on UVD
« Hold local CBDC for domestic life
* Convert between participating CBDCs

* Spend through a card layer that routes from UVD or CBDCs
6.3 Card layer

Users can apply for a card tied to their UDRP wallet. Payments are routed automatically:

1. Determine the payment currency required by the merchant
- Select funding source [rom user balances based on rules and fees
. Execule conversion if needed

. Apply sovereign tax logic

UD ded

- Settle and record under protocol transparency rules

This makes UDRP usable for normal life while still remaining cryplographically anchored.

7. Taxation Primitives

7.1 Instant and configurable taxation
UDRP supports passport indexed taxation where the jurisdiction may define:
* Rate. A fixed rate, progressive schedule or zero.

« Timing. Insiant al transaction time, periodic aggregation, or deferred.

* Base. On deposits, on spending, or on net inflows.

This shifts compliance from paperwork into predictable automation. The bookkeeping becomes native
to the system rather than an afterthought.

7.2, Refund and dispute pathway

Citizens can [ile disputes for refunds or corrections. The dispute is processed under the domestic
authority that issued the tax rule. If approved, refund execution is automatic.

This maintains accountability and avoids turning tax into irreversible automation.
7.3 Passport competition

When tax policy becomes explicit and user experience is high qualily, passports become competitive
products. Jurisdictions that offer better value can attract talent and capital without coercion.

UDRP does not force this outcome. It allows it. The consequence is a new incentive regime.

8. Privacy and Accountability

8.1 Zero knowledge by default

UDRP adopts privacy by default through zero knowledge transaction techniques. The goal is that
citizens do not live under a global panopticon.

8.2 Targeted investigation

Privacy does not mean impunity. UDRP is designed around targeted accountability:

* Investigations focus on specific subjects, not entire populations.
* Disclosure is bounded to relevant time windows and transaction scopes.

* Domestic legal thresholds trigger disclosure, not political whim.

8.3 Symmetry

No actor gets structural opacily. Citizens, institutions and governments operate under the same
cryplographic rules. If sovereign entities move reserves or settle obligations, those actions are
constrained by the same transparency framework.

9. Reserve Transparency

9.1 Real time verifiability

UDRP requires real time veriliability of reserve and solvency state. The system is designed so that
anyone can audil systemic integrity without needing privileged access.

A minimal transparency set includes:

* Proof of reserves for the neutral reserve layer
¢ Proof of liabilities for issued units

* Proof of encumbrances and pledged collateral
* Solvency proofs under rule defined haircuts

* Corridor exposure and netting state

Transparency is systemic, not selective.
10. Governance and Dispute Framework

10.1 Sovereign council

Governance is conducted by a council of participating jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction has a seat.
There are no veto rights.

Protocol upgrades require high consensus thresholds, reflecting constitutional amendment standards
rather than ordinary voting. This ensures thal changes are rare, deliberate and widely accepted.

10.2 Fix forward philosophy
UDRP does not embed emergency halts. Failures are resolved through coordinated upgrades and

continued operation. The system is designed to prefer resilience through procedure rather than reliance
on kill functions.

10.3 Sovereign dispute resolution

UDRP includes a structured complaint framework for disputes between jurisdictions.

A jurisdiction can file a complaint, submit evidence and request remedies. Remedies are enforced
through corridor level constraints such as haircuts, delays, caps or restrictions. The aim is proportional
containment rather than dramatic global shutdowns.

10.4 Citizen mandate extension
A separate democratic extension can allow citizens to propose and vole on domestic questions thal may

inform sovereign positions. This extension is optional and orthogonal to the consumer app. It provides
legitimacy signals while preserving the reality that governance remains a sovereign responsibility.

11. Implications

11.1 From discretionary setilement to rule based settlement

UDRP shifts cross border settlement from discretionary intermediaries to transparent rules. This
reduces hidden [riction, reduces political uncertainty and makes outcomes legible.

11.2 From coercion to attraction

When capital can move easily and compliance is automated, jurisdictions compete by offering real
value to citizens. Benefits must rise, [riclion must fall, and trust must be earned.

11.3 A multipolar equilibrium

UDRP assumes a world with many powers. It does not ask the world to accept one issuer as permanent
center. It encodes neutrality and lets participation be voluntary.
12. Implementation Roadmap

—
*

Specification. Publish the UDRP interface, sovereign module template and corridor policy format.

2. Pilot corridors. Launch limited corridors with cooperative jurisdictions and conservative parame-
lers.

3. Consumer release. Deploy the passport bound wallet, UVD acquisition flow and card routing
layer.

4. Expansion. Onboard additional jurisdictions, expand corridor coverage, refine parameters.

13. Conclusion

United Digital Reserve Protocol is a proposal to upgrade the world monetary interface without
demanding a single empire, a single issuer or a single ideology.

It preserves whal nations insist on preserving: sovereignty, domestic control, political responsibility.
It improves what the world needs improved: settlement neutrality, transparency, predictability and
human scale usability.

UDRP is built on a simple premise. If the unit that connects nations is discretionary, the system
becomes extractive. If the unit that connects nations is rule based and verifiable, cooperation becomes
cheaper than conflict.

This is not a claim that technology will perfect humanity. It is a claim that incentives shape oulcomes,
and that better rails can reduce the profit of coercion.

UDRP is a settlement fabric for a world that has outgrown hidden intermediaries. It is a framework
where privacy is default, accountability is targeted, and no actor sits above the rules.

The end state is not a protocol. The end state is a fairer society, where dignily scales, where access is
not reserved for the already powerful, and where the infrastructure of money serves people instead of
consuming them.

Humanity first.
