Abstract. Universe Dollar (UVD) is a fixed supply, Bitcoin-collateralised currency issued on a
zero-knowledge rollup that anchors to the Bitcoin base layer. UWD is designed to be stable in the
short term, harder in the long term, neutral between nations and trust-minimised between people.
Short-term stability is achieved by indexing UVD to the Universe Reserve Basket (URB), a fixed
basket of 40% gold (XAU), 30% Swiss france (CHF) and 30% Singapore dollar (SGD). Each week,
the protocol reindexes the satoshi backing of 1 UVD so that its purchasing power tracks URB within
an explicit, bounded band. Long-term strengthening arises from three structural choices: (1) fixed
UVD supply set at genesis so that no new units can ever be minted, (2) pure BTC collateral held in
verifiable vaults anchored to Bitcoin and (3) a surplus BTC vault that accumulates excess collateral
from protocol operations and favourable reindexing. As Bitcoin monetises and appreciates relative
to URB, the effective BTC backing per UVD can gradually ratchet upward, subject to strict solvency
constraints. Over multi-year horizons, UVD transitions from URB-like stability to a systemically
harder currency than URB itself, while remaining usable for everyday pricing. UWD is minted only
when users lock BTC into the collateral vault. UWD is redeemed only when users return UWD and
withdraw BTC at a transparent, rules-based rate. A separate credit layer allows UVD to be lent
and BTC to be posted as collateral for UVD borrowing at conservative loan-to-value ratios. Yield
flows to UVD lenders and to the protocol’s surplus without rehypothecating the base BTC backing.
The protocol is released as open source, without admin keys, upgrade switches or kill functions.
Once deployed, it runs as long as Bitcoin runs and at least one implementation continues to produce
rollup proofs. Not even its creators can arbitrarily change the rules, mint more tokens or shut it
down. Beyond technical design, UVD is motivated by a civilizational aim: to end the recurring
pattern where each empire in turn controls the unit of account, and instead root monetary gravity ina
neutral base asset (Bitcoin) and transparent rules. This aligns with old Abrahamic concerns about
just weights and measures, translated into the language of modern cryptography.

1. Introduction

1.1 The problem: monetary gravity captured by each empire in turn

For as long as complex trade has existed, there has been a dominant unit of account and a dominant
issuer behind it.

Historical examples include silver and gold standards in ancient kingdoms, Roman and Byzantine
coinage, Venetian and Florentine bills of exchange, the Spanish silver real, the Dutch guilder, the
British pound and, in the most recent cycle, the US dollar.
Each of these reserve currencies sat at the centre of its era’s trade network and brought real benefits:
smoother long-distance commerce, common pricing and accounting, and a reference point for contracts
and savings. Every empire, for a time, stabilised its world.

But the pattern repeats. First, the centre gains the privilege to issue the unit of account al near-zero
marginal cost. Over generations, war, crisis, politics and human nature (greed, short-termism, weak
successors) lead to over-issuance and debasement. Eventually, trust erodes, capital migrates and trade
gradually reorients around a new centre and a new unit.

Rome debased its denarii. City-states overextended credit. European powers inflated away promises
through war and reconstruction. None of this is uniquely modern or uniquely American; it is a
structural property of any system where a single political centre controls the base money for everyone
else.

Historically, there was no way around it. To coordinate a civilization, one needed a focal point: an
empire, a capital, a mint. Debasement was the recurring price of having a standard at all.

Today, two facts are different. First, there exists a neutral, non-state base asset, Bitcoin, with a
transparent, fixed issuance schedule. Second, we have programmable settlement and cryptography
that allow monetary rules to be defined and enforced in code rather than in councils.

The problem is not that one particular currency is uniquely bad. The problem is the recurring pattern:
whenever one centre owns the scale, sooner or later the scale tilts.

Universe Dollar is a proposal to break this cycle without denying that earlier reserve currencies served
their purpose. They were necessary stages in coordination. The next stage is to keep the coordination
while removing the monopoly over the mint.

UVD attempts this by rooting backing in Bitcoin rather than any state balance sheet and indexing to
a basket spanning gold and conservative currencies from different regions, instead of anointing any
single empire as the reference.

The aim is not to punish a particular currency, but to preserve the benefits of a common unit of account
while making the underlying rules neutral, transparent and resilient to the weaknesses of any single
generation.

1.2 Goal: BTC at the root, fair stability at the surface

Universe Dollar aims to construct a currency that anchors to Bitcoin at the collateral and security
layer, behaves like a stable currency in the short term, inherits Bitcoin’s monetisation in the long term,
explicitly refuses to crown any single slate as issuer of the global unit of account and cannot be altered
or shut down by its own creators.

If Bitcoin is the digital bedrock, UVD is meant to be the habitable layer above it: a relatively stable

climate for trade and savings, sitting on the tectonic plate of BTC.

1.3 Ethical frame: just weights in a programmable age
Across Judaism, Christianity and Islam, three themes recur: condemnation of false scales, skepticism
toward exploitative money and limits on human authority.

Texts criticise dishonest weights and measures. In modern terms, silently changing the unit of account
is structurally similar to moving the scale under a trader’s feet. Practices where one party extracts
value purely because it controls the medium of exchange are treated with suspicion or prohibition.
Earthly power is expected to sit under higher constraints, not above them.

In a global digital economy, the base currency and its issuance rules function as the shared scale. If
one actor can dilute that unit at will, everyone else is trading on tilted ground.

UVD is designed so that supply cannot be increased by decree, backing is visible and auditable, and
the relation between UVD, BTC and the reference basket is fixed in code, not in committees.

The protocol does not claim religious status. It simply attempts to embody a straightforward idea: the
scale used in trade should not secretly move to favour those closest to the mint.

2. Design goals and constraints
2.1 Design goals

1. Stable unit of account. UVD should exhibit relatively low volatility against a conservative
reference basket in day-to-day terms. It should be suitable for denominating prices, wages and
contracts.

2. Bitcoin-rooted collateral. All core backing is BTC. Collateral is visible as UTXOs or equivalent
commitments on Bitcoin.

3. Fixed supply. UVD total supply is set at genesis and never increases. There is no emergency mint,
bailout ability or monetary expansion lever.

4. Deterministic rule set. The currency’s behaviour is determined by explicit formulas and protocol
state. The weekly reindex is algorithmic and bounded; no committee can override it.

on

. Permissionless and censorship resistant. Anyone able to use Bitcoin and the rollup can hold and
transfer UVD. The protocol embeds no blacklist or freeze functionality.

6. Long-term strengthening. Over multi-year arcs, as BTC appreciates relative to the basket and
surplus grows, the effective BTC backing per UVD should tend to increase. UWD becomes “harder”
without ceasing to be “stable”.

7. Immutability in practice. No admin keys and no upgrade hooks for the monetary core. Upgrades,

if any, require new deployments and voluntary social migration, as in Bitcoin forks.

2.2 Constraints
Constraints include: no dependence on bank accounts or off-chain fiat assets for the core collateral; no
authority able to confiscate or freeze balances at the protocol level; no function capable of silently

introducing new UVD units; oracles limited in influence per unit time and unable to override solvency
rules; and no central roadmap that assumes the authors can force changes later.

3. Universe Reserve Basket (URB)

3.1 Definition

UYVD does not stabilise against USD, EUR or any single state currency. Instead, it tracks the Universe
Reserve Basket (URB), a supra-national index combining gold (XAU), Swiss franc (CHF) and
Singapore dollar (SGD).
Let the weights be
wxau =0.40,  wenr = 0.30, wsop = 0.30,

with
WxaU + WCF + Wsqp = I.

Intuitively, 1 URB represents a synthetic purchasing power unit composed of 40% gold, 30% CHF and
30% SGD.

3.2 Why CHF and SGD?

CHF and SGD are chosen for structural reasons. CHF is the currency of a small, export-driven state
with a long-standing reputation as a Western safe haven and conservative monetary policy. SGD is the
currency of a small, trade-heavy city-state, managed as a band against a basket of foreign currencies
and functioning as an Asian safe haven disciplined by external competitiveness.

In short: Switzerland of the West, Switzerland of the East.

Adding gold, a supra-sovereign, non-political metal used as a store of value across empires and faiths
for thousands of years, yields a basket that spans metal, a Western safe haven and an Eastern safe haven,
avoids dependence on any single major reserve issuer and leans on regimes structurally incentivised
toward currency stability.

3.3 BTC priced in URB units

Let Percicur(t) be the price of 1 BTC in CHF at week f, Patcyscn(f) be the price of 1 BTC in SGD
at week ¢ and Parcrxay (ft) be the price of | BTC in units of gold at week f.

Then the price of BTC in URB units is
Parcrurs(t) = wxau - Perenau(t) + wour : Petccur(t) + Wscp * Patcscp(f).
This is the number of URB units one BTC is worth at time ¢. A decentralised oracle mechanism

supplies or aggregates these values and provides Pgrcjuere(t) to the UVD protocol.

4. Monetary model

4.1 Fixed UVD supply
At genesis, the UVD supply is defined as
Ninaxs
the total UVD tokens created once and for all. By construction, N = Nmax, and never increases.

Initially, a protocol Treasury address holds all UVD. UVD enters circulation only when users deposit
BTC and receive UVD from Treasury at the current backing rate. Let M, be the circulating UVD at
week f. Treasury holdings are Ninax — Mp.
4.2 BTC vaults

The protocol tracks two logical BTC vaults: a Backing Vault and a Surplus Vault. The Backing
Vault holds BTC explicitly allocated to back circulating UVD at the current satoshi rate. The Surplus
Vault holds BTC above the target overcollateralisation level of the Backing Vault and accumulates
liquidation penalties and protocol fees.

Let &, be BTC in Backing Vault at time ¢ and §, be BTC in Surplus Vault at time ¢. Total BTC under

protocol control is B, + S;.

4.3 Satoshis per UVD

At week f, define s, as the number of satoshis corresponding to 1 UVD according to the protocol.
Since 1 BTC equals 10° satoshis,

Sy
1UVD = — BTC.
108

Given the BTC price in URB units Petcare (tf), the neutral satoshi rate making | UVD approximately
1 URB is

neutral - 108

“ Pgrcurs(t)

neutral

If the protocol set s, = sj , then 1 UVD would approximately equal 1 URB at that point, up to
spreads and fees.

4.4 Collateralisation ratio

The BTC required to back all circulating UVD at rate s; is

: Np
R :dBTC, = M; -—.

The Backing Vault collateralisation ratio is

7 B; _ B,- 108
~ RequiredBTC,  -M, - 5, |

The protocol enforces C, = Cinin for some configured C,,;, > 1.

4.5 Minting and redemption

At week ¢ with satoshi rate s;, minting works as follows. A user deposits x BTC into the Backing
Vault. The protocol mints

Sy

x
UVD from Treasury to the user. Then &, increases by x and M; increases by the minted amount.

For redemption, a user sends y UVD back to the protocol. The protocol returns
Sp
*” 108

BTC from the Backing Vault to the user. Then M; decreases by y and the Treasury receives y UWD.
These formulas are hard-coded. There is no override function.
4.6 Weekly reindexing of s,
Reindexing aligns UVD with URB and preserves solvency once per week. A specific Bitcoin block
height defines the boundary between weeks.

Parameters include: growth share g € [0,1], max weekly log-change bound k,,,, > 0, minimum
collateral ratio Cyyi, > 1 and target collateral ratio Cirser > Crnin-

At week f the procedure is:
1. Oracle provides Percurp(t).

2. Compute neutral satoshi rate: s} = Pocuma"

jneutral
3. Compute log difference: A = In (5 ).
4. Clamp the adjustment: Actampea = clip(A, —Kmax, max )-
5. Apply growth share: 5,4) = s, - exp ((1 — g) - Agampea)-

6. Compute provisional collateralisation: Ch" = B10

7. Te chrevisional > Cin, Sel sp4) = 5,4). Otherwise, set s,4) = MiCon*

tel

In normal or favourable conditions, UWD tracks URB while slowly accumulating BTC convexity if
g > 0. In adverse conditions, solvency dominates: the protocol refuses to tighten s, in a way that
breaks Cyyin. The reindexing is mechanical, not discretionary.

4.7 Surplus vault dynamics

After reindexing, the Backing Vault collateralisation ratio is

B, - 108

Cat = -
My - Spa

If Chat > Cage: the protocol moves BTC from Backing Vault to Surplus Vault until C4) = Charger.
The Surplus Vault also accumulates BTC from liquidation penalties in the credit layer and any
BTC-denominated protocol fees defined at launch.

Surplus BTC can be moved back to Backing Vault if C; approaches Cyin and may support rule-based
mechanisms (defined at launch) that raise the minimum effective backing per UVD as surplus grows.
The Surplus Vault is part of the protocol’s balance sheet, not a treasury for a team or DAO, there is no
discretionary withdrawal function.

5. Architecture: zero-knowledge rollup on Bitcoin
5.1 Overview
UVD runs on a zero-knowledge rollup that anchors to Bitcoin. The rollup provides a deterministic

execution environment for UVD contracts, periodic state commitments on Bitcoin, validity proofs for
state transitions and an escape hatch to exit to Bitcoin in case of censorship or failure.
5.2 State commitments and proofs

In each rollup batch, users submit transactions on the rollup. A sequencer orders them and computes
the new state root. A prover generates a zero-knowledge proof that the transition from old root to
new root is valid under the VM and UVD contract rules. The new root and proof commitment are
embedded in a Bitcoin transaction.

Once the commitment is mined and has sufficient confirmations, that rollup state is considered finalised.
Security reduces to the correctness of the zk proving system, the integrity of the state commitment
mechanism and the persistence of Bitcoin consensus.

§.3 Exit mechanism

If sequencers fail or censor users, any user can use a previously finalised state root on Bitcoin, construct
a proof of their assets relative to that root and follow a predefined exit procedure to reclaim BTC or

UVD to a target address.

The exact rollup design (data availability, proof system, sequencing) can vary by implementation. For
UVD, the critical part is that the monetary rules are fully enforced inside the VM and that users retain
a way to exit to Bitcoin if the rollup layer misbehaves.

6. Credit and yield layer
The credit layer operates on top of UVD and is separate from the monetary safety of UVD itself.

6.1 Lending and borrowing

Independent lending protocols on the rollup can accept UVD deposits from lenders, accept BTC deposits
as collateral and allow borrowers to draw UVD loans against BTC. Borrow characteristics include
loan-to-value caps based on BTC price vs URB and liquidation thresholds where undercollateralised
positions can be liquidated by third parties.

Upon liquidation, liquidators repay some or all of the UVD debt, receive BTC collateral at a protocol-
defined discount and a portion of the seized BTC (the liquidation penalty) flows into the Surplus
Vault.

6.2 Yield
UYVD holders can hold UVD and remain exposed only to long-term strengthening or lend UVD in the
credit layer to earn periodic interest in UWD. Protocol-level BTC fees and liquidation proceeds further

strengthen the system’s surplus over time. The credit layer can fail independently. A bug in a lending
protocol does not change UVD supply, its BTC backing or the monetary rules.

7. Immutability, governance and forks

7.1 No admin keys

UVD contracts are deployed without privileged owners. There is no pause function for the currency,
no arbitrary freeze or confiscation function and no function that can modify Ninax, basket weights or
core collateral parameters. Once deployed, UWD"s monetary logic is as immutable as the underlying
platforms (Bitcoin and the rollup).

7.2 No protocol governance over money

There is no on-chain governance token, no DAO and no voting mechanism that can mint UVD beyond
Nmax, modify the Universe Reserve Basket composition or weights, override the weekly reindex rules
or spend the Surplus Vault arbitrarily. Governance, if present at all, is restricted to off-chain client
and UX choices and to optional higher-layer protocols built on UVD (DEXs, lenders and similar). To
change monetary rules, a new protocol must be deployed and migration is voluntary.

7.3 Forks

If a subset of users believes a different design is superior, the path is to publish new open source code,
deploy new contracts and persuade people to move BTC and UVD into the new system. As with
Bitcoin, the original Universe Dollar system remains available for those who prefer its rules. Monetary
sovereignty is al the user and market level, not in a governor's hands.

5. Risks

8.1 Oracle risk

URB and BTC prices are supplied by oracles. Risks include manipulated price feeds, outages or
delays and bad aggregation logic. Mitigations include multiple independent data sources, median or
consensus aggregation, time-weighted averages, conservative bounds on weekly adjustments (max)
and encoded fail-safes to skip reindexing when inputs are obviously inconsistent. Oracle risk cannot
be eliminated; it can only be constrained.

$.2 BTC price risk

Fast drawdowns in BTC vs URB stress collateralisation: the Backing Vault may approach C,,;,, and the
protocol may be forced to accept temporary deviations from URB to maintain solvency. The reindex
rule is collateral-aware; it will not tighten s; in a way that violates Cin and it prioritizes survival of
backing over perfect tracking.

Conservative initial settings for Cinin, Ctargec and g, plus healthy surplus, reduce risk but do not remove

it. UVD is still rooted in BTC; any BTC-based system inherits BTC’s fundamental risk profile.

8.3 Implementation and rollup risk

Bugs in smart contracts, rollup execution or consensus or zk proving systems can cause loss of funds
or inconsistent state. Mitigations include independent audits, formal verification where feasible, staged
rollout and bug bounties. There is no central authority with the power to roll back or arbitrarily reverse
errors. This is a design choice: the system trades paternal safety nets for predictable rules.

9. Positioning and impact

Universe Dollar sits between and apart from existing designs.
Unlike fiat-custodial stablecoins, UVD does not rely on dollars, treasuries or bank accounts as core
backing. Unlike empire-pegged designs, UWD does not treat any single state’s currency as the
definition of value; it stabilises against a multi-polar basket of metal, CHF and SGD. Unlike purely
algorithmic systems without hard collateral, UVD is backed by explicit BTC, visible on Bitcoin, with
overcollateralisation constrainis. Unlike CBDCs, UWD does not embed state surveillance, KYC at
protocol level or programmable censorship.

Instead, UVD offers Bitcoin as base collateral, a conservative supra-national stability reference, explicit
equations instead of policy meetings and no admin or issuer with special privileges.

If Bitcoin continues its trajectory toward global collateral status, then UVD can increase structural
demand for BTC as deposited collateral, provide a stable surface for everyday commerce in a BTC-
centric world, dilute the structural privilege of any one nation over the global unit of account and
instantiate an old principle with new tools: let weights and measures be honest, and let the issuer be
bound by the same rules as everyone else.

From that angle, UVD does not compete with Bitcoin. It extends Bitcoin into the domain of stable
units of account in a way that supports rather than dilutes Bitcoin’s role.

10. Conclusion

Universe Dollar is a proposal fora new monetary instrument with these core properties: fixed maximum
supply, Bitcoin-only core collateral, basket-indexed stability against a 40% gold, 30% CHF, 30% SGD
basket, algorithmic weekly reindex with explicit solvency constraints, separation of an immutable
monetary core from optional credit and DeFi layers and no admin keys or protocol-level governance
over money.

It is intended to be published once, open to scrutiny and criticism and then left to the world. No
emperor, committee or foundation sits above it. The only authority is the code and the social consensus
of those who choose to use it.

If adopted at scale, UVD could weaken the historical cycle of empire-bound reserve currencies,
distribute monetary power away from capitals and toward neutral rules, offer a fairer, more transparent
unit of account to billions of people and act as a bridge between the old world of political money and a
new world anchored on Bitcoin.

If not adopted, it still serves as one concrete step in the broader search: a worked example of how
technology, economic incentives and deep human intuitions about justice in exchange might be aligned.

The arc of monetary history has always moved between order and abuse, stability and debasement.
For the first time, we possess tools that allow us to encode the weights and measures themselves as
transparent, globally verifiable rules. Universe Dollar is one attempt to write such rules on top of
Bitcoin and then get out of their way.

The propagation of this system is driven by self-interest and cannot be halted by decree. The nation
that first integrates this standard secures a strategic advantage in the resulting fair playing field. The
equilibrium is inevitable. For woman, life and liberty.
