#### Foreword

Language, usually meant to communicate, often leads to
misunderstandings. Even in the same country speaking the same language,
different disciplines, trades, and professions often use different words to
mean more or less the same thing often rendering clear communication the
victim. This issue becomes even more pronounced in technology, where
rapid innovation collides with deep specialisation. Within a single domain –
take security, for example – terminology between, say, risk management
and incident response can vary dramatically. Between civilian activity and
the military, the differences in terms can be even more stark. What’s
referred to as a _data breach_ in the civilian sector is called _spillage_ by the
U.S. Department of Defense. While one group will talk about
_vulnerabilities_ , others will discuss _attack surface_. What IT professionals
might say is _data normalisation_ ; an epidemiologist will call _harmonisation_.
This plethora of terms often creates confusion, slows collaboration, and
makes interdisciplinary efforts more complex than they need to be.

This extraordinary glossary was created to meet that challenge head-on.
With over 5,000 clearly defined tech terms and over 700 acronyms decoded,
it offers a unified language for professionals working across IT
management and operations, cybersecurity, risk management, artificial
intelligence, and related fields. More than just definitions, it provides rich
explanations and real-world context – clarifying not just what a term means,
but _how_ and _where_ it’s used. The goal is not only to reduce ambiguity but
also to foster better understanding between technologists, managers,
policymakers, and users.

What makes this work truly exceptional, and what sets it apart from
typical glossaries, is its completeness. Thanks to the years of meticulous
research and dedication by Dr. Gary Hinson, this volume captures virtually
every significant term in the modern digital ecosystem. But it goes further
still – unlike many reference tools, this glossary often includes full


descriptions, nuanced usage notes, and, where relevant, quick links to
external resources for deeper exploration.

This monumental tome will prove invaluable for anyone navigating
today’s tech landscape. For managers encountering unfamiliar jargon, for
editors striving for clarity and consistency, and for professionals and
students alike who need a trustworthy source of meaning, this glossary will
become the go-to standard when clear, concise terminology is important.
Whether in textbooks or RFPs, work orders or product or engineering
specifications, or legal documents, the right words are paramount. Quite
literally, this monumental work gets everyone on the same page.

Kudos to Dr. Hinson for this major contribution to just about anyone
dealing with the digital universe – which these days, is pretty much all of
us.

Language shapes how we think. In security, it shapes how we act, how we
collaborate, and how we fail.

Cybersecurity, as a field, has suffered for years from a fragmented
vocabulary. We borrow terms from engineering, risk management, military
doctrine, academia, and marketing. We invent new ones at a breakneck
pace, often without checking if they already exist elsewhere. Worse, we use
the same words to mean different things depending on our background, our
role, or our latest framework of choice.

And people get very protective over those words. Some of the biggest
arguments Iʼve seen are over whether or not cybersecurity should have a
space or not. Really. Iʼve had hate mail and harassment over it.

```
The result is confusion, chaos, and a lack of holistic thinking.
```
This matters. Cybersecurity is not a standalone discipline. It is a domain
of security, sitting alongside physical, personnel, and technical domains. It
intersects with safety, governance, operations, and culture. If we’re going to


respond to the complex, dynamic threats we face, we have to be able to
work together.

```
That requires a shared language.
```
This hyperglossary is a starting point. Not a definitive guide, and not an
attempt to impose a single top-down doctrine. Instead, itʼs an effort to bring
some coherence to the words we use every day. To make it possible to
understand one another, spot patterns and align our work. It wonʼt be
exhaustive or final. Language evolves, and so must this.

I’ve lost count of the meetings I’ve sat in where people thought they
disagreed, but were speaking different security dialects. Where decisions
got delayed because two teams were using different definitions for “threat”
or “control.” These moments add friction. At scale, they cause real harm.

More fundamentally, we need this clarity to make progress. It’s hard to
build shared models, improve resilience, or even teach effectively if we
can’t agree on what basic terms mean. Whether you’re writing policy,
engineering a system, running an incident, or trying to explain a risk to a
boardroom, having a consistent, plain-language vocabulary makes life
easier.

This isn’t about dumbing things down. It’s about raising the standard of
thinking. Clear language doesn’t just improve communication. It forces us
to be precise. It makes hidden assumptions visible. It helps identify gaps in
understanding and practice. And it makes space for genuine collaboration
across disciplines.

We’re at a point where the complexity of our systems, the capabilities of
our threats, and the interconnectedness of everything demand better
cooperation. That can’t happen if we’re all talking past each other.

Take this glossary as a tool. Use it, challenge it, add to it. Let it be
something we build together, rather than something we argue over. Because
the sooner we can speak the same language, the sooner we can get on with
solving the problems that matter.

#### Preface

This hyperglossary is the result of a personal quest to make sense of the rich
language of cybersecurity. This book’s size is a testament to the breadth and
complexity of the subject, coupled with an extraordinary rate of change. I
started this writing project back for my own benefit in the 1990s, at about
the time that a group coordinated by the UK Department of Trade and
Industry adopted a corporate security manual, becoming BS 7799 “Code of
Practice for Information Security Management” in 1995.

Information security was a novelty back then, one that intrigued me with
its focus on protecting and exploiting information. Since then, we’ve seen
the rise of IT security and lately **cybersecurity** as computing and the
Internet have become integral parts of modern life. Nevertheless, I
appreciate that original focus on protecting and exploiting the valuable
information content: to me, the computer systems and technologies are
merely tools for data processing (now _there’s_ an historic term!).

```
Cybersecurity : in common use, this primarily refers to
technological/IT security controls protecting computer systems,
networks, and the associated data against attacks from the Internet.
There’s more to it, though.
```
The field can appear fragmented and scattered, with experts in various
areas naturally developing their own jargon and specialised meanings. To
address the challenge, I developed the **hyperglossary** format in 2001,
making a reference resource even more valuable. I find the combination of
clear plain-English definitions with embedded links to further information a
powerful and intuitive way to capture and utilise the details. What’s more,
it’s _fun_ to release my inner geek, following my nose from term-to-term,
rediscovering and reconnecting with concepts I’d almost forgotten much as
I enjoyed browsing Roget’s Thesaurus and encyclopaedias when I was a
teen.


```
Hyperglossary : contraction of hyper linked glossary , an intuitive
reference combining the best features of a glossary, dictionary, wiki,
thesaurus, and encyclopaedia with specialist inputs, plain English
definitions, and extensive cross-referencing.
```
In recent years, I’ve incorporated terms relating to the risk and security
aspects of **I** nternet **o** f **T** hings and **A** rtificial **I** ntelligence, with quantum
computing just around the corner. While the pace of change in technology
and cybersecurity keeps us professionals on our toes, it makes things tricky
for business people and others struggling to keep up. Being left behind
presents significant information risks in its own right; for example,
unpatched IT systems are more vulnerable to ransomware, and mis- or dis-
information is threatening democracy and personal freedoms, both real and
present dangers as we see from the news headlines.

By publishing this book, I hope to foster greater consistency in our
language, not only for those immersed in the field but also for technology
and other professionals, business leaders, regulatory authorities, standards
bodies, and others. Given that English is a foreign language for some of
you, I have tried hard to create reasonably simple and accessible definitions,
although the technical complexities and conceptual aspects sometimes
frustrate that aim. I tried, honestly I tried.

Beyond simply a curated collection of terms and definitions, this book
supports a vibrant online community through which cybersecurity
professionals, from students to seasoned experts, share their knowledge and
collectively enhance our understanding of the field. Ultimately, the
hyperglossary _plus_ the global community of readers makes an unbeatable
combination. Read on for opportunities to play your part in moving things
forward.

**PURPOSE**

The primary purpose of this hyperglossary is to provide a comprehensive,
user-friendly reference for anyone seeking to understand and use the
terminology of cybersecurity and related domains.


Specifically, it aims to:

```
Provide reasonably clear and concise definitions of about 5,000 key
terms-of-art plus expansions of about 700 abbreviations, acronyms,
and initialisms. Pragmatic explanations complement the formal
definitions. Clearer communication improves understanding, enabling
us to engage more productively in daily work, debate, research, policy-
making, and decision-making.
Acknowledge the origins of the concepts and terms we use today,
while appreciating the subtleties of different meanings, emphases, and
interpretations as the field matures.
Standardise our vocabulary where appropriate, encouraging
consistency and reducing misinterpretation across laws, regulations,
standards, policies, procedures, guidelines, advertisements, job
descriptions, management and audit reports, emails, presentations,
articles, conversations, and more. Language issues present information
risks in this area, worth avoiding or mitigating I feel. Greater linguistic
alignment should reduce unnecessary fragmentation and divergence
within the field, presenting a more unified front.
Bridge the communication gaps between technical experts and non-
technical individuals such as business leaders and industry regulators –
a common problem arising from limited familiarity and fluency in
each other’s languages, perspectives, and worlds.
Facilitate teaching, training, knowledge sharing, learning, and personal
development within the cybersecurity profession, reducing barriers to
entry and progression.
Enable and support transnational discussion, collaboration, innovation,
and technical development. Cybersecurity is most certainly a global
concern.
Lead the way in aligning terminology, especially concerning core
terms such as ‘threat,’ ‘vulnerability,’ ‘impact,’ and ‘risk.’ If we wish to
be taken seriously as professional experts, we really ought to agree on
the fundamentals and be consistent in how we put things across.
```
**SCOPE**


This hyperglossary encompasses a broad spectrum of cybersecurity-related
areas, including the following:

```
Risk, particularly the proactive management of information risk as a
business imperative.
Information security, protecting all forms of information (not just
digital data).
Risk and security aspects of I nformation, O perational,
C ommunications, V irtual, and S mart T echnologies ( IT , OT , CT , VT ,
and ST ) – and perhaps others.
Privacy and data protection.
Governance, accountability, rôles, and responsibilities.
Compliance and conformity – similar but distinct concerns.
Ethics and morality, navigating conflicts in ways that demonstrate
integrity and foster trust.
Business continuity, including resilience, D isaster R ecovery, and
contingency planning.
Various forms of assurance such as testing, reviewing, assessing, and
auditing, including supply chain assurance, a substantial issue with
cloud computing and globalisation.
The intersection of technological areas such as A rtificial I ntelligence
and I nternet o f T hings, plus other concerns such as environmental
sustainability and climate change, with cybersecurity.
```
While striving for comprehensive coverage, the field continues to
expand rapidly. Therefore, ever since its inception decades ago, the
hyperglossary has been and remains a dynamic product, evolving and
maturing with ongoing research and input from the global community as the
language itself changes. The book you are reading is merely a snapshot in
time.

Language can be misused or misunderstood and, despite writing this
hyperglossary, I am not immune. While I have made every effort to research
and define terms carefully, they often have ‘flexible’ meanings in practice
and my interpretations may not always align with or capture the original
authors’ intentions. Context is crucial.


Many definitions include quoted text from authoritative sources such as
international standards, but the quotes may not always be complete or
perfectly up-to-date. _Please_ refer to the original sources using the provided
‘More info’ links if it matters to you, especially if you plan to develop and
share variant definitions.

Finally, to be absolutely clear, I am _not_ a lawyer. This hyperglossary
does not constitute legal advice. In some jurisdictions and circumstances,
certain terms may have specific legal interpretations that differ significantly
from those presented here. Do not rely on this glossary for anything critical
or vital: it is intended solely for educational purposes. Always seek advice
from competent, trustworthy, qualified, and experienced professional
advisors and carefully evaluate their guidance.

**AUTHOR PERSPECTIVE**

With a career spanning several decades in the information risk and security
domain, I have come to appreciate the value of global alignment and
coordination within the field, particularly concerning the language we
share.

My journey began after transitioning from a microbiology/genetics post-
doc in the early 1980s to an initial role as a DEC system/network
administrator at a UK pharmaceuticals R&D division. For two decades,
primarily in the UK and Europe, I gained extensive, multi-faceted
experience in information risk management, technology audit, and
information security management within major power generation, defence
and financial services companies, providing me with a broad understanding
of the challenges and nuances across diverse sectors.

Throughout my career, I have not only witnessed but also contributed, in
a small way, to the evolution and maturity of this critical field. Long-term
involvement with the committee behind the ISO/IEC 27000 standards has
instilled in me a strong preference for pragmatic, real-world solutions in
cybersecurity.

Since completing an MBA in 2000 and emigrating to NZ, my focus
shifted more towards the governance, management, and strategic aspects,
consulting for **S** mall and **M** edium-sized **B** usinesses and running my own


micro-business. The challenges of applying security principles in resource-
constrained environments have become increasingly evident. Coupled with
ever-changing information risks, cybersecurity requires frequent
realignment with both overarching business objectives and technology
capabilities.

**METHODS AND SOURCES**

The definitions provided in the hyperglossary represent a synthesis of my
professional experience since the 80s, with authoritative sources such as:

```
Industry standards and publications ( e.g. ISO27k and the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework).
Assorted conceptual models and approaches ( e.g. COBIT and DVMS).
A bulging home office library with getting on for 200 cybersecurity
books to hand and a dozen more in the ‘read me’ pile for this
bookworm.
Academic research and scholarly articles, plus pieces by professionals
in the industry journals.
Reputable vendor documentation plus marketing materials and market
analyst reports.
Insightful and sometimes provocative contributions from fellow
experts through various professional social media platforms ( e.g.
LinkedIn, ISACA Engage, the ISO27k Forum, various blogs plus the
SANS, RISKS and CRYPTO-GRAM newsletters).
Relevant laws and regulations ( e.g. GDPR and SOC2).
Practical experience gained through decades of real-world application.
```
Despite my high ideals and grand expectations, I consider myself a
realist and pragmatist. As you will soon see, I favour commonsense
explanations reflecting commonplace usage within the field, while also
acknowledging the context of more formal definitions where relevant. My
aim is to provide definitions that are both accurate and readily
understandable for a diverse audience. Please accept my apologies in
advance for any misinterpretations: I am entirely human.


**STRUCTURE AND USE**

By convention, the glossary is organised alphabetically from A to Z, with a
few numeric entries (such as 2FA) appearing at the beginning. A typical
entry consists of the following:

```
Term:
The singular cybersecurity-related word, phrase, abbreviation,
acronym, or initialism being defined, along with common variants
and abbreviations (picked out in bold ).
For the sake of brevity, different word forms of essentially the
same term are normally combined under a single entry rather than
being listed separately.
```
```
Definition:
A reasonably clear and concise plain-English explanation of the
term, with links to the definitions of words and phrases elsewhere
within the hyperglossary (these are functional hyperlinks in the
eBook version). Alternative definitions are provided for terms
with distinct meanings, depending on the context in which they
are used.
Pragmatic guidance, examples, and notes covering various
nuances.
In italics , cited content quoted from definitive references (such as
standards) with minor editorial changes in some cases. Rather
than citing every term from every reference, I have selected the
most appropriate, well-phrased, or definitive ones, sometimes
incorporating different interpretations to emphasise other
perspectives.
‘See also’ links to related or similar terms.
‘Cf .’ links to distinct, complementary, contrasting, or often-
confused terms.
‘More info’ links to more information on the web.
```
Check the hyperglossary whenever you encounter unfamiliar
cybersecurity terminology. The hyperglossary format is designed for easy
browsing with ~39,000 hyperlinks, 99% of which are internal cross-
references while the remaining 1% are external/Internet URLs. At times,


you will find yourself exploring related concepts at length, flowing
intuitively between terms and definitions in the eBook. You may prefer the
printed book for ready reference, quiet reflection/self-study, and note-
taking.

The uncited definitions and explanations in this hyperglossary ( _i.e_. my
inputs) are generally valid and applicable within the context of information
risk, information security, and related areas. Having _tried_ to define terms
generically and straightforwardly, based on my knowledge and experience
as well as any cited references, I would be flattered if you find my
definitions useful enough to share or circulate further. However, if you do,
**_please_** **cite this cybersecurity hyperglossary** (with a hyperlink to
hyperglossary.com if appropriate), just as I have openly acknowledged my
sources.

```
It is evident from the reference sources that some definitions have been
doing the rounds for years, with successive authors adding their spin
and occasionally taking off at tangents. With this book, I hope to guide
us all gently back in line.
```

**_YOUR_** **PART IN THIS UNDERTAKING**

To foster a dynamic and collaborative approach to cybersecurity
terminology, I have established an online hub for the global community of
reader. Our discussion forum (a Google group) is specifically intended to
debate the terms and definitions, suggest additions or clarifications, point
out errors that ought to be corrected, and offer alternative interpretations.
We are keen to share insights into the terminology and its practical
application. Connect with your peers and contribute to the collective
understanding of cybersecurity language.

```
Please join us at Hyperglossary.com We are a diverse global group of
information risk and security professionals, students, academics,
technologists and language experts, standardisers, and others.
Participation is free: this is your opportunity to participate and
contribute your wisdom to the next edition of the hyperglossary.
```
Future updates to both the print and eBook versions will be informed by
the active participation of this community. Working together, I believe we
can clarify the jargon, bridge communication gaps, reduce ambiguity
(risk!), and foster a more consistent lexicon.

**CONCLUDING REMARKS**

I invite you to explore this Cybersecurity hyperglossary, engage with the
online community, and contribute to its ongoing development. Working
together, we can achieve greater clarity and understanding in this vital field.
Browse around, think, learn, and join in the debate.

#### Author Biography

**Dr. Gary Hinson, MBA** is an information security specialist with a
particular interest in the human and business aspects of both protecting and
exploiting information.
Following an honours degree in genetics at the University of York in
1983, then a PhD and postdoctoral research in molecular biology/microbial
genetics at the University of Leicester, I transitioned into my first proper job
in 1987. Thanks to some IT experience in connection with the development
of DNA fingerprinting, I became a DEC VAX systems and network
administrator ('sysmgr') for the research and development arm of Beecham
Pharmaceuticals. The commercial value of research information was very
evident with heavy investment to develop and protect intellectual property,
primarily by legal means (drug patents). At the time, however, the
vulnerabilities associated with ‘knowledge workers’ and the early networks
were barely understood and not fully appreciated by management.
Management concerns regarding protection of medical, personal and
business data were not obvious, at least not to me. As a privileged user deep
in the bowels of IT, I had ready access to the databases, applications, drug
designs plus medical safety and efficacy studies, even executive emails,
with essentially no auditing or oversight. Looking back, we were quite
naïve and trusting.

By 1990, I had developed a professional interest in the information risk
and security field when it was more commonly known as computer or IT
security (pre-dating ‘cyber’!). It seemed odd to me that systems and
network security was such a low strategic priority with no obvious intent to
improve. The research staff and managers had been physically threatened
by animal liberation/anti-vivisection activists, indicating (to me) an
increased threat elevating the information risks. Management, however,
were mostly thinking in terms of perimeter fences and security guards and
there were problems there too!

When Beecham was taken over by SmithKline – a much larger US-based
pharmaceutical company – we were instructed by senior management
simply to join and merge the two sprawling DECnet networks without


regard to the information risks that I believed were substantial. Network
node _addressing_ was a concern but information security was barely an
afterthought.

Time to move on.
For more than a decade I learned the ropes in corporate security and
audit positions, mostly in the UK and Europe. My work for an electricity
company, initially in IT security, was an opportunity to implement BS 7799
protecting both **I** nformation **T** echnology and **O** perational **T** echnology (real-
time process control systems, then known as SCADA/ICS) in a critical
infrastructure context. I was shoulder-tapped for a move into Internal Audit
and an excellent grounding in assurance, governance, strategy and senior
management, with an ‘executive’ (part-time) MBA from the University of
Bath in 2000. Leading the UK/European technology audit functions for
BAE SYSTEMS and Siemens exposed me to defence, aeroospace and high-
tech industries facing their own unique risk, security, governance,
compliance and cultural challenges.

Since 2000, I have been consulting, writing and selling _gigabytes_ of
information risk and security awareness and training content, policies etc.,
supporting clients implementing the ISO/IEC 27000 standards and
nurturing from scratch the vibrant 5,500-strong “ISO27k Forum”. I
emigrated to New Zealand in 2005.

As a member of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27, I enjoy contributing to the
information security management standards and interacting with hundreds
of professional peers. It's good to give something back to the community
and stay in touch with innovative approaches.

Now living on a rural farm block near Napier in New Zealand, I have
ample opportunity to cogitate on infosec and AI while repairing fences,
installing a backup generator, tending to our animals or trout fishing. I love
the natural beauty of the NZ countryside, spoilt only by the roar of heavy
machinery and chainsaws as the surrounding pine forest is being harvested.
Oh and the occasional earthquake or flood - harsh lessons in resilience and
the perils of underinvestment in infrastructure being all too evident down
here on the Far Side!

A ccess C ontrol, access matrix.
```
**Access right** Individual people, systems, programs,

```
organisations, etc. may be granted or denied
access to controlled assets such as data,
transactions/functions, or physical locations

(ISACA glossary).
```
**Access to personal
information**

```
Access to personal information. “The ability
to view personal information held by an
organization. This ability may be
complemented by an ability to update or
correct the information. Access defines the
intersection of identity and data, that is, who
can do what to which data. Access is one of
the fair information practice principles.
Individuals need to be able to find out what
personal information an entity has on file
about them and how the information is
being used. Individuals need to be able to
correct erroneous information in such
records” ( T rust S ervices C riteria).
```
```
Accident While information security incidents may
result from deliberate acts by hackers,
malware, fraudsters, spies, etc., the greater
proportion by number are in fact the result
of inadvertent or unintentional acts, natural

accidents (health and safety failures) and
illnesses that befall workers may qualify as
information security incidents since people
are information assets.

Accountability Being accountable. In contrast to
responsibility and authority, this sticky
property cannot be unilaterally delegated or
passed by the accountable person or
organisation to another; in other words, the
buck stops here. “Property that ensures that
the actions of an entity may be traced
```

```
uniquely to that entity” (ISO/IEC 2382 ).
“State of being accountable. Notes:
Accountability relates to an allocated
responsibility. The responsibility can be
based on regulation or agreement or through
assignment as part of delegation. For
systems, accountability is a property that
ensures that actions of an entity can be
traced uniquely to the entity. In a
governance context, accountability is the
obligation of an individual or organization
to account for its activities, for completion
of a deliverable or task, accept the
responsibility for those activities,
deliverables or tasks, and to disclose the
results in a transparent manner” (ISO/IEC
TS 5723). “State of being accountable.
Notes: Accountability relates to an allocated
responsibility. The responsibility can be
based on regulation or agreement or through
assignment as part of delegation.
Accountability involves a person or entity
being accountable for something to another
person or entity, through particular means
and according to particular criteria”
(ISO/IEC 22989 ). “The ability to map a
given activity or event back to the
responsible party” (ISACA glossary).
```
**Accountability of
governance**

```
“The ability of governance to ensure that
enterprise objectives are achieved by
evaluating stakeholder needs, conditions
and options; setting direction through
prioritization and decision making; and
monitoring performance, compliance and
progress against plans. In most enterprises,
governance is the responsibility of the board
```

```
of directors under the leadership of the
chairperson” (ISACA glossary).
```
```
Accountable Someone (a person or organisation) who is
held/called to account by an authority for a
failure (such as a privacy breach or some
other incident) is formally required to
explain their part in the failure. They may
be sanctioned or penalised in some way
(disciplinary action, dismissal, prosecution,
fine, restriction or withdrawal of privileges,
additional oversight, etc. ), if the authority
determines that they did not adequately
fulfil their obligations. “Required or
expected to justify actions or decisions;
being answerable and responsible for those
actions & decisions” (NZISM). “Answerable
for actions, decisions and performance”
(ISO/IEC 22989).

process or scope” (ISACA glossary).
```
```
Accounting Principles and practices of systematically,
formally, and thoroughly recording and
cross-checking various details such that
relevant parties can be held to account for
their activities. Most I nformation
T echnology systems, for instance, can
```

```
automatically record information about user
logons, use of privileges and overrides,
alerts, alarms and other potentially
significant events in their logs or accounting
files, with utilities to search and report on
them, even if these days the details are no
longer needed to recharge users for their use
of the computers (common practice prior to
the 1990s).
```
```
Accreditation Process of verifying that an organisation or
individual is competent to check/audit and
certify others, to a level of assurance
required by a trusted authority acting on
behalf of stakeholders. “A procedure by
which an authoritative body gives formal
recognition, approval and acceptance of the
associated residual security risk with the
operation of a system and issues a formal
approval to operate the system” (NZISM).
Cf. certification.

**Accuracy, accurate** Truthful and valid, faithfully representing

```
factual objective reality. An integrity
property. “Measure of closeness of results
of observations, computations, or estimates
to the true values or the values accepted as
being true” (ISO 17572-1). “Quality of that
which is free of error [and/or] qualitative
assessment of freedom from error, a high
assessment corresponding to a small error
[and/or] quantative measure of the
magnitude of error, preferably expressed as
```

```
a function of the relative error, a high value
of this measure corresponding to a small
error” (ISO/IEC 2382 ). “The fraction of
predictions that a classification model
predicted correctly. In multiclass
classification, accuracy is defined as correct
predictions divided by total number of
examples. In binary classification, accuracy
is defined as true positives plus true
negatives divided by total number of
examples” (ISACA glossary). “Ability to get
the true result. For quantitative tests, the
accuracy expresses the closeness of
agreement between the true value and the

Digital Evidence offered succinct,
pragmatic guidance for UK police gathering
digital forensic evidence, last updated by
the A ssociation of C hief P olice O fficers in
```
2011. Built on four basic principles: “(1) No
action taken by law enforcement agencies,
persons employed within those agencies or
their agents should change data which may
subsequently be relied upon in court; (2) In
circumstances where a person finds it
necessary to access original data, that
person must be competent to do so and be
able to give evidence explaining the
relevance and the implications of their
actions; (3) An audit trail or other record of
all processes applied to digital evidence
should be created and preserved. An
independent third party should be able to
examine those processes and achieve the
same result; (4) The person in charge of the
investigation has overall responsibility for
ensuring that the law and these principles
are adhered to.” Superseded by the **F** orensic

Highly sophisticated, sustained, and
ultimately damaging cyberattack, or a
campaign involving a series of attacks, by a
very resourceful, determined, and capable
adversary, typically cyber-spooks. Generally
involves a combination of methods and
tools, such as custom malware, social
engineering, hacking (including hacked
hardware, software, or firmware, including
things ), and/or physical intrusion. Aside
from the extreme technical challenges of
characterising and understanding APTs,
tracing and attributing their sources and
even consistently naming the variants and
the associated originators is tricky
(something a crowdsourced APT
spreadsheet addresses). “An adversary that
possesses sophisticated levels of expertise
and significant resources which allow it to
create opportunities to achieve its objectives
by using multiple attack vectors ( e.g. , cyber,
physical, and deception). These objectives
typically include establishing and extending
footholds within the information technology
infrastructure of the targeted organizations
for purposes of exfiltrating information,
undermining or impeding critical aspects of
a mission, program, or organization; or
positioning itself to carry out these
objectives in the future. The advanced
persistent threat: (i) pursues its objectives
repeatedly over an extended period of time;
(ii) adapts to defenders’ efforts to resist it;
and (iii) is determined to maintain the level
of interaction needed to execute its

**Analysis, analytics** Process of systematically exploring,
examining, investigating, and evaluating
information relating to risks, incidents,
forensic evidence, _etc_. in some depth.
“Evaluation of potential digital evidence in
order to assess its relevance to the
investigation. Note: Potential digital
evidence, which is determined to be
relevant, becomes digital evidence”
_(ISO/IEC 27042 -2)_. “The examination of
acquired data for its significance and
probative value to the case” _(NIST SP 800-

assumed premises. 3. The methodical
investigation of a problem and the


```
separation of that problem into smaller
related units for further detailed study
(Source: ANSI)” (ISACA glossary). “Any
form of test, comparison or analytical
method performed on an item/exhibit or
relevant material recovered from an
item/exhibit” (FSRCoP).
```
```
Analysis criteria Analysis criteria. “The criteria used to
analyze, quantify and select ways to address
risk, reward, and compliance” (OCEG GRC
Glossary).
```
```
Analytical model Mathematical formula for generating
metrics (such as a trend in a relevant
security parameter) from measurements
(normally a time series of values of the
parameter), giving meaning to the numbers
(“See, I told you things are getting better!”).
“Algorithm or calculation combining one or
more base measures and/or derived
measures with associated decision criteria”
(ISO/IEC 27000).
```
**Analytical technique** Systematic method or approach for analysis,

```
e.g. a classic ‘scientific’ technique is to
study current knowledge and generate a
credible theoretical hypothesis, then test it
against reality using experimental data and
so advance the state of knowledge. “The
examination of ratios, trends and changes in
balances and other values between periods

accompany a particular document, topic, or
activity, e.g. explaining the content in more
detail, commenting on and critiquing it,

```
Annual audit,
statutory audit
```
```
Financial audit conducted by external
auditors to confirm that the information in
the organisation’s annual report and
accounts is accurate and truthful. This
involves checking the integrity of any
financial or other systems on which the
accounts are based, and testing the
organisation’s compliance with applicable
```

```
laws and regulations, e.g. concerning
accounting practices and tax treatments.
```
**Anomaly, anomalous** Something markedly different, unusual,

```
abnormal, unexpected, or exceptional,
hence intriguing and perhaps of concern.
While large data anomalies (such as
numerous data values completely missing
for a significant period) may be easily
spotted by eye (provided someone is
looking!), small anomalies in large data sets
or D ata B ases can be identified much more
easily and reliably by systematic statistical
analysis, e.g. applying Benford’s law. Such
anomalies are inherently interesting, hinting
at the possibility of unexpected
relationships, biases, or events, perhaps
even information security incidents such as
bugs, flaws, frauds, malware, or hacks in
progress. Anomalous data communications
( e.g. an unusual surge or dip in network
traffic volume, or unusual senders and
recipients) and activities ( e.g. unusual out-
of-hours working) may indicate issues
worthy of investigation ( e.g. ‘technical
issues,’ misconfiguration, fraud, information
theft/spying, malware). “Unusual or
statistically rare” (ISACA glossary).
```
```
Anomaly detection The process of identifying anomalous
conditions, outliers or spurious items, etc. in
a data set or sequence. Naturally implies the
ability to distinguish anomalous from
normal if extreme values, potentially
indicating a genuine discontinuity or flaw in
the model, a subjective or arbitrary
determination based on an accurate
```

```
understanding of the data variability and
(often) statistical analysis of objective
evidence. “Detection on the basis of
whether the system activity matches that
defined as abnormal” (ISACA glossary).
```
```
Anonymity Someone’s right to go about their life and
business without unnecessarily revealing
their identity, e.g. whistleblowers or for
privacy reasons. Typically achieved through
discretion, sometimes through a trusted
third party or using techniques such as
anonymisation, tokenisation, or redaction.
With careful design, the systematic process
of identifying and authenticating messages,
instructions, data, etc. can be logically and
practically separated from identifying and
authenticating the originating people,
organisations, systems, etc.
May conflict with law enforcement and
other sociological or ethical expectations,
objectives, requirements, or obligations
such as personal accountability.
“Characteristic of information that does not
permit a personally identifiable information
principal to be identified directly or
indirectly” (ISO/IEC 29100 ). “The quality
or state of not being named or identified”
(ISACA glossary).
```
**Anonymisation** Permanent and complete removal of the

```
personal information necessary to identify
specific individuals in a D ata B ase,
document, etc., normally for privacy
reasons. “Process by which personally
identifiable information (PII) is irreversibly
altered in such a way that a PII principal can
```

```
no longer be identified directly or indirectly,
either by the PII controller alone or in
collaboration with any other party”
(ISO/IEC 29100 ). “Irreversible severance of
a data set from the identity of the data
contributor to prevent any future
reidentification, even by the organization
collecting the data under any condition”
(ISACA glossary). Cf. pseudonymisation.

**Anti-pass-back** Physical security access control

```
arrangement such as a man trap designed to
prevent someone presenting their access
card to open a one-person-at-a-time
controlled entrance for themselves, then
handing their card back to someone else
(typically an unauthorised visitor)
permitting them also to access the
```

```
controlled area. Electronic access control
systems may keep track of individuals,
preventing them from re-accessing an area
unless they have previously exited it,
requiring them to present their access cards
at both entry and exit points. “A security
mechanism preventing an access card or
similar device from being used to enter an

```
For an auditor, scientist, judge or similar
professional rôle, the appearance of being
independent is almost as important as the
actuality. It affects the nature and quality of
interactions with stakeholders, including
aspects such as access to sensitive
information, tolerance, influence, and
mutual respect (trust). “The behavior that is
appropriate of an IS auditor to meet the
situations occurring during audit work
(interviews, meetings, reporting, etc .). Note:
An IS auditor should be aware that
appearance of independence depends on the
perceptions of others and can be influenced

independent computer language, such as
Java, JavaScript, or Visual Basic. Notes: An
applet is usually embedded in an HyperText
Markup Language (HTML) page
downloaded from web servers. Applets can
only perform a restricted set of operations,
thus preventing, or at least minimizing, the
possible security compromise of the host
computers. However, applets expose the
user ' s machine to risk if not properly
controlled by the browser, which should not
allow an applet to access a machine ' s
information without prior authorization of
the user” (ISACA glossary).

AI-related terms, concepts, and practices are
emerging from a rapidly evolving cluster of
complex and disruptive technologies with
significant information risk, information
security, privacy, compliance, business, and
societal implications. While the information
risks and ethical concerns associated with
AI are challenging and potentially
disturbing, AI systems show promise in the
cybersecurity field, e.g. automated
network/system intrusion, phishing,
malware and fraud detection, prevention
and response, and the intelligent design of
business processes and systems.

Assurance Provision of a certain level of trust,
confidence, confirmation, or proof of
something, normally as a result of
competently reviewing, checking, testing, or
auditing it against relevant specifications,
expectations, or objectives, e.g. a ‘security-
assured’ program has presumably been
tested to confirm that it satisfies information
security requirements. “The act of
objectively and competently evaluating
subject matter to provide conclusions and
confidence that statements and beliefs about
the subject matter are justified and true”
(OCEG GRC Glossary). “Statement
intended to increase the level of
stakeholders’ confidence about an
organization’s governance, risk
management, and control processes over an
issue, condition, subject matter, or activity
under review when compared to established
criteria” (IIA GIAS). “An IT audit and
assurance professional is engaged to issue a
written communication expressing a
conclusion about the subject matters for
which the accountable party is responsible.
Assurance refers to a number of related
activities designed to provide the reader or
user of the report with a level of assurance
or comfort regarding the subject matter.
Note: Assurance engagements could include
support for audited financial statements,
reviews of controls, compliance with
```

required standards and practices, and
compliance with agreements, licenses,
legislation and regulation” (ISACA
glossary).
```
```
Assurance actions &
controls
```
```
“Actions & controls that primarily serve
assurance activities” (OCEG GRC
Glossary).
```
```
Assurance control Control designed to mitigate unacceptable
assurance risks. While assurance is itself a
form of detective control ( e.g. examinations
identifying and disclosing issues to
management), various controls can
strengthen assurance processes, e.g.
recruitment, training, and oversight to
ensure that technology auditors are
sufficiently competent, diligent, trustworthy,
experienced, etc. for their audit
engagements.
```
**Assurance
engagement, assurance
initiative**

```
Assurance engagement. “An objective
examination of evidence for the purpose of
providing an assessment on risk
management, control or governance
processes for the enterprise. Note: Examples
may include financial, performance,
compliance and system security
engagements” (ISACA glossary).
```
```
Assurance provider “Someone who conducts assurance
activities” (OCEG GRC Glossary).
```
```
Assurance risk Uncertainty relating to the assurance
required and provided, e.g. whether the
particular sampling approach proposed for
an audit will or will not discover issues,
```

```
what kinds of issues it might or might not
reveal, and hence whether the approach is
appropriate or needs to be reconsidered in a
particular situation.
```
```
Assurance service Service providing or relating to some form
of assurance, e.g. testing, reviewing,
inspecting, assessing, auditing. “Services
through which internal auditors perform
objective assessments to provide assurance.
Examples of assurance services include
compliance, financial,
operational/performance, and technology
engagements. Internal auditors may provide
limited or reasonable assurance, depending
on the nature, timing, and extent of
procedures performed” (IIA GIAS).
```
**Asymmetric
cryptography,
asymmetric
encryption/decryption,
public key
cryptography**

```
Type of cryptosystem that uses pairs of
mathematically related but quite different
public and private keys to either encrypt or
decrypt. Although the pairs of keys are
relatively simple and quick to generate on a
computer, it is infeasible to guess or
calculate either key from the other without
additional information due to the complex
mathematics and long key lengths involved.
“Cryptography in which a public key and a
corresponding private key are used for
encryption and decryption. Note: If a public
key is used for encryption, the
corresponding private key must be used for
decryption, and vice versa” (ISO/IEC 2382 ).

computer security. Examples: Malicious
logic, wiretapping” (ISO/IEC 2382 ).
“Attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable,
steal or gain unauthorized access to or make
unauthorized use of an asset” (ISO/IEC
27000 ). “Successful or unsuccessful
unauthorized attempt to destroy, alter,
disable, gain access to an asset or any
attempt to expose, steal, or make
unauthorized use of an asset” (ISO/IEC
27002 ). “An actual occurrence of an
adverse event” (ISACA glossary).
```
```
Attacker Adversary who deliberately mounts an
attack. “Person deliberately exploiting
vulnerabilities in technical and non-
technical security controls in order to steal
or compromise information systems and
networks, or to compromise availability to
legitimate users of information system and
network resources” (ISO/IEC 27033-1).
```
**Attack mechanism** The method and means by which an attack

```
is perpetrated. “A method used to deliver
the exploit. Unless the attacker is personally
performing the attack, an attack mechanism
may involve a payload, or container, that
delivers the exploit to the target” (ISACA
glossary).
```
```
Attack surface Notional 3-dimensional representation of
the organisation’s information assets, risks,
etc. where one axis in some way represents
vulnerabilities and/or their exposure by
various parts of the organisation, forming a
complex and dynamic ‘surface’ that might
```

```
be actively attacked or exploited by hackers,
malware, etc. to the corresponding extent.
Implies that improving the protection of
information assets and/or reducing the
exposure or extent of vulnerabilities will
somehow improve the organisation’s
information security and reduce the area ...
without necessarily stating how that might
be achieved. A security metric. “The IT
equipment and software used in a system.
The greater the attack surface the greater the
chances are of an attacker finding an
exploitable vulnerability” (NZISM). “The
amount of ICT equipment and software
used in a system. The greater the attack
surface the greater the chances of an
adversary finding an exploitable security
vulnerability” (AusISM). See also security
landscape, risk universe, risk profile,

```
**Attack toolkit** See crimeware.

```
Attack vector Path, process, or mechanism by which a
vulnerable network, system, device,
application, organisation, building, site,
model, etc. might be actively compromised
and exploited by an adversary. “Path or
means by which an attacker can gain access
to a computer or network server in order to
deliver a malicious outcome [such as] IoT
devices [and] smart phones” (ISO/IEC

**Attention mechanism** Facility for an **A** rtificial **I** ntelligence system

```
to focus on (pay extra attention to) heavily
weighted parts of the content during the
training process. “In artificial intelligence

learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) that
weights the importance of different inputs,
thus enhancing the model’s ability to
process and interpret complex data patterns,
leading to more accurate and relevant
outcomes” (ISACA glossary).
```
```
Attest, attestation Formally documented assertion by a duly
authorised and accountable person that the
organisation complies with (fulfils the
requirements of) particular laws/regulations
or professional practices such as relevant
governance, accounting, and audit
standards. Although highly stylised and
carefully worded to exclude other liabilities,
the signatories are personally accountable
for the veracity of such statements; hence,
attestation is usually taken very seriously,
making it a surprisingly powerful
administrative control, akin to taking an
oath. “An engagement in which an IT
auditor is engaged to either examine
management’s assertion regarding a
```

```
particular subject matter or the subject
matter directly” (ISACA glossary).
```
```
Attribute a. [Noun] Measurable or observable
characteristic, quality, or parameter.
“Property or characteristic of an object

personal information that their identity can
be ‘linked’ (inferred or determined) from
other information, thereby compromising
their privacy. See ISO/IEC 27551.
```
```
Attribute sample Q uality C ontrol/audit sampling method that
compares the rate of occurrence of item
characteristics ( e.g. visible defects in goods
on a production line, inaccurate or dubious
financial figures in a ledger, suspicious
entries in a log or evidence of
```

```
noncompliance) to determine whether a
response is justified ( e.g. reject the entire
batch or investigate further). Can also be
used for Q uality A ssurance and process
improvement, e.g. to identify adverse trends
worthy of management attention, hopefully
forestalling the occurrence of quality
failures or other incidents. “A method to
select a portion of a population based on the
presence or absence of a certain
characteristic” (ISACA glossary). See also
stratified sample, random sample,
systematic stratified sample, time series

Attribution a. Acknowledgement referencing or
citing the attributed source, originator,
and/or owner of I ntellectual P roperty
being reproduced elsewhere in order to
thank them and (hopefully) reduce the
risk of being accused of plagiarism or
copyright abuse. Although legally
speaking attribution may be irrelevant
to copyright infringement, it is
generally considered ethical, polite,
helpful, and valuable. Be nice!
b. Cybersecurity incidents are often
blamed on (attributed to) certain
perpetrators according to someone’s
evaluation of evidence in the malware
or hacking tools used, or other clues
such as the demands and claims made.
```

```
However, perpetrators of illegal acts
are (for obvious reasons) keen to
remain undercover and may
deliberately mislead analysts (false-
flags). Furthermore, attacks often
involve a blend of code, tools, and
techniques from disparate sources,
obtained through the hacking
underground scene. “Process of
attempting to assign a device to an
individual and may be progressed
through a number of different methods,
each method having different risks.
Cell site analysis may be one method
by which patterns of usage may be
assessed against what would be
expected if a given device was used by
a specific person, as opposed to if it
was not used by that person”
(FSRCoP).
```
**Audience** People who are the _intended_ recipients of
one or more communicated messages, as
distinct from those who actually receive
them ( _e.g._ by interception or surveillance).
“The person or group that is intended to
receive a message” _(OCEG GRC Glossary)_.

```
Audit Structured, formal, and disciplined
assurance process of systematic
examination, review, assessment, testing,
consideration, evaluation, and reporting by
one or more competent and trusted people
who – crucially – are independent of the
subject area or matters being audited. In
many organisations, ‘audit’ also refers to the
business department or function (usually
```

Internal Audit, Quality Audit, _etc._ ) and/or
third party organisation (External Audit)
responsible for auditing. Derived from the
Latin _audio_ (to listen). “Systematic,
independent and documented process for
obtaining audit evidence and evaluating it
objectively to determine the extent to which
the audit criteria are fulfilled. Notes: An
audit can be an internal audit (first party) or
an external audit (second party or third
party), and it can be a combined audit
(combining two or more disciplines). ‘Audit
evidence’ and ‘audit criteria’ are defined in
ISO 19011” _(ISO/IEC 27000 )_. [Additional
note] “An internal audit is conducted by the
organization itself, or by an external party
on its behalf” _(ISO/IEC 42001 )_. “A formal
inspection and verification to check whether

Auditability Measure of the capability of being audited.
This assurance objective for important
systems, processes, business relationships,
etc. implies the need to generate and retain
high-integrity records of relevant events and
activities ( e.g. security logs) that can be
independently reviewed if and when
required, along with transparency and
trustworthiness. A significant challenge for
A rtificial I ntelligence systems. “The level to
which transactions can be traced and
audited through a system” (ISACA

**Audit independence,
auditor independence**

```
Capability, opportunity, and resolute
determination of an auditor to gather
evidence and analyse information
dispassionately, deciding, acting, and
reporting independently, free of undue
influence, interference, constraint, or
pressure from auditees. Implies or involves
detached impartiality and objectivity
without bias and prejudice, acting with
absolute integrity, fairness, neutrality,
balance, even-handedness, etc. An essential
factor and unique driver of value in
auditing, particularly a competent, diligent,
and trustworthy auditor’s state of mind and
attitudes, regardless of their employment
status or reporting line. “1. Self-governance.
```

2. The freedom from conditions that
threaten objectivity or the appearance of
objectivity. Such threats to objectivity must
be managed at the individual auditor,
engagement, functional and organizational
levels. Independence includes Independence
of mind and Independence in appearance”
_(ITAF)_. “The state of being free from
structural or functional conditions that
threaten the ability of the assurance provider
to perform assurance activities with

```
Audit plan Given finite resources ( e.g. auditors,
auditees, time, money, management
support), audit engagements are prioritised,
scoped, and scheduled to optimise the value
generated by satisfying audit objectives, e.g.
providing assurance regarding the
organisation’s management of significant
risks or compliance. “1. A plan containing
the nature, timing and extent of audit
procedures to be performed by engagement
team members in order to obtain sufficient
appropriate audit evidence to form an
opinion. Notes: Includes the areas to be
audited, the type of work planned, the high-
level objectives and scope of the work, and
topics such as budget, resource allocation,
schedule dates, type of report and its
intended audience and other general aspects
of the work. 2. A high-level description of
the audit work to be performed in a certain
period of time” (ISACA glossary).

activities and processes, as well as the time
period covered; A virtual location is where
an organization performs work or provides a
service using an on-line environment
allowing individuals irrespective of physical

transactions or stages in a business or
computer process, which may be used to
reconstruct the exact sequence of events,
e.g. an I nformation T echnology system
security log is typically configured to record
important information such as successful
and failed system logons, and security
alarms and alerts with timestamps. “A
logical path linking a sequence of events, in
the form of data, used to trace the
transactions that have affected the contents
of a record” (ISACA glossary). “Data
collected for the potential use in a security
audit” (ISO/IEC 2382). Cf. audit log.

record, qualifications, immigration status,
criminal record, credit status, etc. to identify
possible security and trustworthiness issues.
A service often provided by specialist

Backup Snapshot copy of data, programs,
configurations, etc. from a computer system
at a given point in time. In theory, backups
enable recovery to a known state after an
incident (such as a ransomware infection or
data centre fire) but in practice things don’t
always go to plan. Integrity and availability
are critical concerns for backups, plus
confidentiality if the information content is
sensitive; hence, backups should be risk-
assessed and appropriately secured,
normally by means of documented policies
and procedures, redundancy (multiple
backup copies, stored diversely), firesafes,
offline and off-site storage, encryption,
oversight/monitoring, etc. Most importantly
of all, restoration and recovery must be
tested, safely, before an incident happens for
real because if it fails then, it is too late: an
incident may have become a disaster. That’s
Murphy’s law. “The files, equipment, data
and procedures available for use in the
event of a failure or loss, if the originals are
destroyed or out of service” (ISACA

2. To cause a computer system to reach a
known beginning state. A boot program, in
firmware, typically performs the boot
function, which includes loading basic
instructions that tell the computer how to
load programs into memory and how to
begin executing those programs. A
distinction can be made between a warm
boot and a cold boot. A cold boot starts the
system from a powered-down state. A warm
boot restarts the computer while it is
powered up. Important differences between
the two procedures are: a power-up self-test,

**Buffer overflow** Software bug or design flaw that allows – or

```
fails to prevent – a buffer space in memory
being over-filled with excessive amounts of
data, such that it overwrites adjacent
memory locations. While this normally
results in the program simply crashing,
hackers are adept at crafting malicious data
in such a way that the overspill is directly
executed or points to another memory
location where exploit code has also been
inserted. Buffers are used internally to hold
interim values for calculations and text
operations, plus data input through the
keyboard or arriving through the network:
these may also be vulnerable to overflows if
unchecked. “An anomaly that occurs when
a program or process tries to store more data
in a buffer (temporary data storage area)
than it was intended to hold. Notes: Because
buffers contain a finite amount of data,
excess data can overflow into adjacent
buffers, corrupting or overwriting their valid
data. Although it may occur accidentally
through programming error, buffer overflow
is also an increasingly common type of
security attack on data integrity. In buffer
overflow attacks, the extra data may contain
codes designed to trigger specific actions,
```

```
which in effect, send new instructions to the
attacked computer that can damage user
files, change data or disclose confidential
information” (ISACA glossary). “Occurs
when a program or process tries to store
more data in a buffer (temporary data
storage area) than it was intended to hold.
Since buffers are created to contain a finite
amount of data, the extra information –
which has to go somewhere – can overflow
into adjacent buffers, corrupting or
overwriting the valid data held in them”

**Calibrate, calibration** Process to check and align a measurement function,
instrument, or process with a reference standard
(usually indirectly via secondary standards,
themselves calibrated against a definitive primary
standard stored under specified conditions with
strong physical security and environmental control,
and strictly limited access) ensuring sufficient
accuracy and repeatability of measured values for the
required purposes, reducing the need for tolerance.
An important information integrity control. “The set
of operations that establish, under specified

Conceptual approach promoting systematic

capabilities from informal, ad hoc , unreliable
beginnings to more formal, consistent, and
productive ‘levels,’ primarily by increasing
management and process controls. “1. A model that
contains the essential elements of effective processes
for one or more disciplines. It also describes an
evolutionary improvement path from ad hoc,
immature processes to disciplined, mature processes
with improved quality and effectiveness. 2. A model,
from the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), used
by many enterprises to identify best practices useful
in helping them assess and increase the maturity of
their software development processes. Notes: CMM
ranks software development enterprises according to
a hierarchy of five process maturity levels. Each
level ranks the development environment according
to its capability of producing quality software. A set
of standards is associated with each of the five
levels. The standards for level one describe the most
immature or chaotic processes, and the standards for
level five describe the most mature or quality
processes. This maturity model indicates the degree
of reliability or dependency a business can place on a
process to achieve its desired goals or objectives. It
is also a collection of instructions that an enterprise
can follow to gain better control over its software
development process” (ISACA glossary).

Chain letter Item or piece of correspondence ( e.g. letter, postcard,
email) urging the recipient to pass it on to others.
The content of chain letters varies and, although
some are legitimate, most are fraudulently using
social engineering techniques to part fools from their
valuables ( e.g. pyramid schemes). Apart from
consuming network bandwidth, data storage
capacity, wasting users’ time, and fooling victims,
chain letters sometimes gain false respectability as a
result of being passed on, and effectively endorsed,
by trusted but foolish intermediaries.

**Chain of custody,
chain of evidence**

```
Maintenance of a complete, accurate, and
trustworthy record of the physical custody,
protection, and treatment of forensic evidence at
every point between its original collection and
eventual presentation in court, such that there is no
reasonable doubt as to its origin, authenticity, and
integrity. “Demonstrable possession, movement,
handling and location of material from one point in
time until another. Note: Material includes
information and other associated assets in the context
of ISO/IEC 27002” (ISO/IEC 27002 ). “The process
of evidence handling (from collection to
presentation) that is necessary to maintain the
validity and integrity of evidence. Notes: Includes
documentation of who had access to the evidence
and when and the ability to identify that the evidence
```

```
is the exact item that was recovered or tested. Lack
of control over evidence can lead to it being
discredited. Chain of custody depends on verifying
that evidence could not have been tampered with.
This is accomplished by sealing off the evidence so it
cannot be changed and providing a documentary
record of custody to prove that the evidence was, at
all times, under strict control and not subject to
tampering” (ISACA glossary). “A process that tracks
the movement of evidence through its collection,
safeguarding, and analysis lifecycle by documenting
each person who handled the evidence, the date/time
it was collected or transferred, and the purpose for
any transfers” (NIST SP 800-101).
```
```
Challenge a. [Verb] To pose a question intended to raise or
dispel doubt or concern, or to elicit a strong
reaction, e.g. a lawyer cross-examining a
witness in court, or a sentry calling “Halt! Who
goes there?,” anticipating a specific response
from a friendly.
b. [Noun] Something difficult to overcome or
complete successfully.
```
**Challenge-response** Protocol or process in which the respondent must
provide the correct, anticipated response or
credential when challenged, otherwise the challenger
knows something is amiss. Mediaeval gatekeepers
demanded “Who goes there?” in anticipation of a
visitor revealing the secret pass word to authenticate
themselves and so be allowed to pass through a
gateway. Nowadays used to establish network
communications by confirming that a counterparty
holds the correct private key without actually
disclosing the key over the network, typically by
having them encrypt and return a nonce supplied by
the challenger who can then decrypt the response
with the respondent’s public key to verify that the
respondent does in fact hold the corresponding
private key (a zero knowledge approach).


```
Challenge-response
token
```
```
Challenge-response token. “A method of user
authentication carried out through use of the
Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
(CHAP). Notes: When a user tries to log into the
server using CHAP, the server sends the user a
‘challenge,’ which is a random value. The user enters
a password, which is used as an encryption key to
encrypt the ‘challenge’ and return it to the server.
The server is aware of the password. It, therefore,
encrypts the ‘challenge’ value and compares it with
the value received from the user. If the values match,
the user is authenticated. The challenge/response
activity continues throughout the session, protecting
it from password-sniffing attacks. In addition, CHAP
is not vulnerable to ‘man-in-the-middle’ attacks
because the challenge value is a random value that
changes on each access attempt” (ISACA glossary).

```
```
Checks and balances Checking and reconciliation of accounts or data files
compiled separately but supposed to match item-for-
item. In double-entry bookkeeping, for instance,
every credit in one ledger should correspond to an
```

```
equal and opposite debit in another; hence, the total
value of a debit account should balance (precisely
equal) the total value of the matching credit account.
Any discrepancy should be investigated.
```
**Checksum, check value** Basic error-detection technique that involves
calculating a characteristic value from some digital
data which is transmitted or stored with the data, and
can be checked to verify integrity of the data
transmission or storage. “A value generated by an
algorithm and associated with an input value and/or
whole input file. The checksum value can be used to
assess its corresponding input data or file later and
verify that the input has not been maliciously altered.
If a subsequent checksum value no longer matches
the initial value, the input may have been altered or
corrupted” _(ISACA glossary)_. “A value that is
computed by a function that is dependent on the
contents of a data object and is stored or transmitted
together with the object, for the purpose of detecting
changes in the data” ( _SANS glossary_ ). “Verifies or
checks the integrity of data. A good checksum
algorithm: is easily to compute; will usually output a
significantly different value, even for small changes
made to the input; and can detect many types of data
corruptions ... often used to verify the integrity of
operating system, programme, library or other
programmatic elements, images and firmware
updates ... check digits and parity bits are special
uses of checksums” _(NZISM)_. See also hash, parity.

```
Clark–Wilson model Formal model or architecture developed by David D.
Clark and David R. Wilson in 1987 elaborates on the
Biba model to protect the integrity of all forms of
information, not just computer data.
```
**Class, classify,
classification, category**

```
Pragmatic grouping-together and labelling of similar
or related information assets that are believed to
share similar risks and hence control requirements.
While classification is a quick process that reduces
the need individually to risk-assess and identify
security controls needed to protect every single asset
in each class, the appropriate generic controls still
need to be applied. Furthermore, generic controls
may not be ideal for a specific situation; hence,
higher classes may require more intense risk analysis
and bespoke controls. Classification typically
involves confidentiality or privacy criteria but more
complex schemes may also take account of integrity
and availability requirements. Unfortunately, there is
no universal agreement on classification labels and
their meanings; hence, in addition to the conformity
```

```
issues within any organisation there are additional
risks of misinterpretation leading to inadequate or
inappropriate security when classified materials are
shared between organisations or business units with
different understandings. “The identification of two
or more categories in which an item belongs”
(ISACA glossary). “The categorisation of systems
and data according to the expected impact if it was to
be compromised” (AusISM).
```
**Classical data analysis** “A data analysis technique where data collection is
followed by the imposition of a model, and the
analysis, estimation, and testing that follow focus on
the parameters of that model” _(NIST SP 800-55v1)_.
_Cf_. **E** xploratory **D** ata **A** nalysis.

```
Classification scheme Formal description of an organisation’s classification
processes; applicability, authority, rôles,
responsibilities, and accountability; criteria/rules to
be applied; levels, tags, or labels; and the associated
controls. May cover upgrading/downgrading and
relabelling arrangements, assurance controls,
enforcement, and more.
```
```
Classified data “Data that would cause damage, serious damage or
exceptionally grave damage to the national interest,
an organisation or an individual if compromised ( i.e.
data assessed as PROTECTED, SECRET or TOP
SECRET)” (AusISM).
```
**Classified information** Information with a designated class or level. In the
government/military context, the designations
usually concern confidentiality requirements such as
SECRET. “Government information that requires
protection from unauthorised disclosure” _(_ NZISM _)_.

```
Classified system “Systems that process, store or communicate
classified information” (NZISM).
```

```
Clear, wipe Basic low-assurance form of sanitisation or plain
deletion of data. Typically leaves residues that may
be recovered trivially or with concerted effort and
maybe forensic tools and techniques. “Cause one or
more storage locations to be set in a prescribed state,
usually that corresponding to zero or that
corresponding to the space character” (ISO/IEC
2382 ). “Sanitize using logical techniques on data in
all user-addressable storage locations for protection
against simple non-invasive data recovery techniques
using the same interface available to the user”
(ISO/IEC 27040).
```
```
Clearing “Overwriting classified data on a data medium that
has a particular security classification and security
category, so that this data medium may be reused for
writing at the same security classification and
security category” (ISO/IEC 2382). Cf. clear/wipe.
```

**Clickbait, click-bait,
click bait**

```
Something attractive or intriguing (such as fake
news, kittens, and scantily clad people) that lures
unsuspecting computer users to click a link, open an
attachment, install or run a program or whatever,
leading typically to their devices being infected with
malware and/or their being defrauded or otherwise
compromised. A form of social engineering. The
thriving underground market in clickbait pays a
premium for clickbait pages with tens or hundreds of
thousands of affluent and/or naïve visitors.
```
```
Click fraud Fraud techniques targeting click-through affiliate
marketing schemes that pay a bounty for visitors’
clicks. In one form, malware surreptitiously swaps
genuine affiliate codes embedded in U niform
R esource L ocators and cookies for codes linked to
the fraudsters’ own accounts. In another, malware
racks up large pay-per-click charges and/or
```

```
artificially inflates website reputational ratings (and
hence commercial value) by ‘clicking’ online
advertisements.
```
```
Clickjacking Hacking technique that surreptitiously an
unexpectedly diverts visitors’ browsers to a different
website, typically then launching malware attacks
against visitors’ devices. See also click fraud.
```
```
Click-regret That sinking feeling that follows an unwise click on
a dubious link, app, attachment, or security warning

```
```
Client Customer, recipient, or beneficiary of a service.
“Functional unit that receives shared services from a
server” (ISO/IEC 2382).
```
**Client-server** Technical architecture or design typically involving
dedicated and powerful **I** nformation **T** echnology
systems (servers) providing shared information
services via networks to individual
distributed/remote systems (clients), _e.g._ a web
server providing website content to browser
applications running on various user devices.
“Pertaining to a method of distributed processing in
which a client obtains services from a server”
_(ISO/IEC 2382 )_. “A term used to broadly describe
the relationship between the receiver and provider of
a service. Generally, the client-server describes a
networked system where front-end applications, like
the client, make service requests to another
networked system. Client-server relationships are
defined primarily by software. In a local area
network (LAN), the workstation is the client, and the
file server is the server. However, client-server
systems are inherently more complex than file-server
systems. Two disparate programs must work in
tandem, and there are many more decisions to make
about separating data and processing between the
client workstations and the database server. The


```
database server encapsulates database files and
indexes, restricts access, enforces security and
provides applications with a consistent interface to
data via a data dictionary” (ISACA glossary).
```
```
Climate General or local conditions of weather, ecology,
economy, business, market, etc. “The collective
perception about self, surroundings, and others –
including perceptions about culture, some aspect of
culture, or some topical area” (OCEG GRC
Glossary).
```
**Climate change** Long-term global temperature increases leading to
potentially existential risks for organisms (including
humans!) that cannot survive sustained mean
temperatures a few degrees warmer or the associated
environmental impacts such as rising sea levels,
melting ice caps, droughts, food shortages, and more
extreme weather incidents.

```
Clipper chip Failed US government initiative in the mid-1990s to
introduce a cryptographic subsystem on a proprietary
computer chip using Skipjack with cryptographic
keys recoverable by the authorities, allowing them to
decrypt data at will. Aside from flaws in the
cryptographic design, introducing additional security
vulnerabilities, and the obvious trust, privacy, and
oversight issues relating to key escrow and
surveillance, black hats would simply avoid Clipper,
thus negating its alleged purpose. The project’s
incredible naïveté hints at ulterior motives: the real
goal might have been to raise awareness of the social
issues arising from the use of strong encryption,
particularly by criminals and terrorists. Side-effects
included stimulating the dissemination and use of
other strong encryption systems, and a backlash
against invasions of privacy by the authorities.
```
```
Clipping Removing the extremes of a signal or data set, i.e.
values that are likely to cause processing issues or
```

```
dubious outliers that would otherwise skew the
analysis. “A technique for handling outliers.
Specifically, clipping includes reducing feature
values that are greater than a set maximum value
down to that maximum value. It also involves
increasing feature values that are less than a specific
minimum value up to that minimum value” (ISACA
glossary).
```
```
Clone, cloning Controlled security devices such as authentication
tokens and passes, keys, virtual systems, D ata B ases,

duplicated/copied illicitly unless there are adequate
preventive a n d/or de t ective controls. They may also
be cloned for legitimate reasons such as backups,

Private audio-visual surveillance system typically
used by security guards to monitor premises, safes,
vaults, card access-controlled doors/gates, security
checkpoints, etc. Record evidence of legitimate
access plus any intruders, thieves, and saboteurs; by
local councils, public bodies, prisons, and the police
to oversee public places for disorder, crimes, and
safety issues; and by industrial plant operators to
monitor production operations and machinery.
Modern CCTV systems use networked high-
definition digital IP cameras. Some use A rtificial

rapidly and released with minimal management
effort or service provider interaction” (ISACA

```
a. Use of words, symbols, strings, phrases, sounds,
or images to represent and communicate
messages via an encoding process. A crude form
of substitution, potentially made more secure
through the use of multiple code books, O ne-
T ime P ads, steganography, etc. “Collection of
rules that maps the elements of a first set onto
the elements of a second set. Notes: The
elements of either set may be characters or
character strings. The first set is called coded set
and the second set is called code set. Each
element of the code set may be related to more
than one element of the coded set but the
reverse is not true” (ISO/IEC 2382 ). See also

Code audit Audit of source code to gain assurance regarding
aspects such as code quality, security,
appropriateness, maintainability, and I ntellectual
P roperty R ights ( e.g. conformity with policies and
other requirements; well documented with no
backdoors or dubious functions). “An independent
review of source code by a person, team or tool to
verify compliance with software design
documentation and programming standards.
Correctness and efficiency may also be evaluated.
This contrasts with code inspections, code reviews
and code walkthroughs” (ISACA glossary).
```

```
Code book, codebook If a list of code words is too long to remember and
communicate reliably to those who need to code or
decode messages, it may be necessary to prepare and
distribute one or more lists from which to lookup
codes and their plaintext equivalents. The security
issues are similar to those associated with the
generation and distribution of encryption keys, e.g.
ensuring that code books do not fall into enemy
hands and cannot simply be reconstructed by the
enemy through educated guesswork, known plaintext
attacks, or other forms of cryptanalysis.
```
```
Code injection Hacking techniques to insert malicious content into
programs during their execution, exploiting various
O perating S ystem and application flaws and bugs,
specifically injection flaws. Used by some malware.
See also AtomBombing, Cross-Site Scripting,
HTML injection.
```
**Codename, codeword** Private monicker or tag for an initiative, tactic,
project, planned attack, _etc._ enabling insiders to talk
discreetly about the subject, hopefully without
tipping off outsiders. An example of security by
obscurity. “A short (usually a single word)
description of a project, operation or activity,
typically assigned used for reasons of reliability,
clarity, brevity, or secrecy. Each code word is
assembled in accordance with the specific rules of
the code and assigned a unique meaning” _(NZISM)_.

```
Code of conduct Set of corporate rules for acceptable/unacceptable
worker behaviours, typically expressed as a policy,
guideline, agreement, rulebook, etc. “Sets out the
principles, values, standards, or rules of behavior that
guide the organization ’ s decisions, procedures, and
systems. The Code of Conduct is, in effect, a set of
the most important core policies” (OCEG GRC
Glossary). See also code, code of ethics, code of
practice.
```

```
Code of ethics Comprehensive set of rules, ideals, objectives,
principles, practices, and/or values deemed ethical by
the organisation, culture, or society. Given that a
written code cannot realistically cover all possible
ethical issues, a substantial part inevitably remains
unstated: however, workers are expected to interpret
and apply the guidance sensibly when facing novel
situations and dilemmas, acting in the best interests
of the organisation, culture, or society. “A document
designed to influence employees ’ individual and
organizational behavior by defining organizational
values and the rules to be applied in certain
situations. Note: A code of ethics is adopted to assist
those in the enterprise called upon to make decisions
in understanding the difference between ‘right’ and
‘wrong’ and to apply this understanding to their
decisions” (ISACA glossary). See also code of
conduct, code of practice.

London in 1943 during the second World War.
Although it was programmed mechanically using
patch cables and switches, its sole purpose was to
break encrypted teleprinter messages by brute force
attack on the keys used on the German Lorenz
cryptography machines; hence, arguably it was not a
general-purpose computer ( Cf. ENIAC) but was the
first cyberweapon.

prove it if required. Implies the need for those
requirements and expectations to be clearly
identified and accepted, e.g. in the terms and
conditions of a formal policy, agreement, or
understanding between the parties. Alternative
strategies or tactics (such as seeking to deny, avoid,
or evade conformity checks; fabricating evidence or
concealing/destroying evidence of nonconformity;
coercing conformity checkers; restricting, frustrating,
and delaying their checks; or callously accepting the
possibility of penalties and other adverse
consequences) are considered unethical, making
them risky, particularly for those deemed
accountable. Cf. compliance control.

Contingency Unanticipated and often inherently unpredictable
situation, incident or disaster ( e.g. a bomb, plane
crash, flood, or fire), logical/technical disaster ( e.g.
malware outbreak, equipment breakdown, software
flaw/bug, hack or similar attack on a major business
system or network), and business disaster ( e.g. a
serious fraud or hostile takeover attempt). The
appropriate responses are contingent (dependent) on
the exact nature, scale and severity of the incident,
the context ( e.g. timepoint) in which it occurs, and
the resources available. “Possible future event,
condition or eventuality” (ISO 22300).

management,
contingency thinking**

```
Forward-thinking, flexible planning approach for
preparing, motivating, and marshalling the
organisation’s people and other resources to cope as
effectively as possible in a contingency situation
such as a major incident or disaster. Involves
preparing and exercising general-purpose plans or
preparations (such as forming a crisis management
team from competent, capable people still available),
stocking up on tools and resources (such as duct
tape, walkie-talkies, and white boards), and building
capabilities (such as resourcefulness, adaptability,
and a willingness to ‘go the extra mile’ and ‘do
whatever it takes’) ahead of time. Incidents that are
expected or predictable should be covered by
conventional risk management activities such as
mitigating controls, resilience, and D isaster

Contract Binding agreement between two or more parties, for
various strengths of ‘binding.’ Formal contracts
prepared by qualified lawyers and signed
(‘executed’) by duly authorised representatives are
normally legally binding on the parties but may be
unenforceable (especially any terms deemed ‘unfair’
by the courts or overridden by laws such as the fair
use provisions of copyright law). Verbal, informal,
presumed, or social contracts may also be legally
binding, although naturally they are harder to prove
and hence enforce. If someone breaks the seal on
shrink-wrapped software, for instance, they may be
deemed to have accepted the licence terms and
conditions visible through the clear plastic film,
implying a contractual commitment. Generally
speaking, contracts may not be unilaterally imposed
by one party on the other ( e.g. email disclaimers);
hence, a signature and/or a ‘consideration’ (normally
a payment) may be necessary to demonstrate
someone’s willingness to commit. “An agreement
between two or more persons or entities, which is
intended to be enforceable at law and includes a
contract made by deed or in writing” (NZISM).

Countermeasure Generally synonymous with control. May refer more
specifically to a reactive or corrective control in
some contexts. “Action, device, procedure,
technique, or other measure that is designed to
minimize vulnerability” (ISO/IEC 2382 ). “Action
taken to lower the likelihood of a security threat
scenario succeeding in its objectives, or to reduce the

techniques that meet or oppose ( i.e ., counters) a
threat, a vulnerability, or an attack by eliminating or
preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause,
or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective
action can be taken” (CNSSI 4009 ). “Reactive
methods used to prevent an exploit from successfully

```
a. NIST’s “Framework for Improving Critical
Infrastructure Cybersecurity” reflects the
timeline of an incident and the need for
appropriate information security controls that
precede, accompany, or follow an incident
through the identify, protect, detect, respond,
and recover phases (called ‘functions’ within
CSF). The US Cybersecurity Enhancement Act
2014 required NIST to develop “a prioritised,
flexible, repeatable, performance based, and
cost-effective approach, including information
security measures and controls that may be
voluntarily adopted by owners and operators of
critical infrastructure to help them identify,
assess, and manage cyber risks.” It is essentially
a simple risk and incident management structure
to help protect the US C ritical N ational
I nfrastructure against cyber risks (called
‘cybersecurity risks’ within CSF), drawing on
several other standards and methods for the
controls. Cf. C ritical S uccess F actor. More info:

**Delegated authority,
delegation, delegator,
delegate, delegatee**

```
Refers to someone (the delegator) passing
some of their authority (responsibility and
power) to someone else (the delegate or
delegatee, generally a subordinate) within
specified parameters, e.g. giving them the
ability to sign-off (authorise) expenses
claims or procurement orders up to a certain
dollar value, make decisions within a certain
area, or represent (stand in for) them at a
meeting. Implies the delegator’s trust in the
delegate and often involves additional
controls such as oversight and mentoring.
While the delegate is personally accountable
for any incidents arising from their actions
and inactions, the delegator generally shares
the risk and remains personally accountable
for their decision to delegate authority.

destruction, destruction of data storage
```

```
media [while] deletion refers to the
elimination of the bit patterns or comparable
practices, not simply marking or moving the
data to be hidden. As a result, excessive
effort for PII reconstruction will be required,
considering all the means likely reasonably
to be used, e.g. available state of the art of
technology, human and technical resources,
costs and time. For selecting the methods for
deletion, a risk-based approach is to be
taken into account, including sensitivity of
PII and potential use of forensic tools.
Required measures can change during time
depending on the state of the art of
technology and other factors. PII can be also
changed by applying an irreversible de-
identification technique. Such data often fall
out of privacy legislation. Further guidance
on a de-identification technique can be
found in ISO/IEC 20889-11” (ISO/IEC

Diverse routing Innate capability of a packet-switched
network architecture whereby individual
data packets may safely take various routes
between source and destination nodes ( e.g.
dynamically re-routing around links with
performance constraints) before being
assembled to deliver the message content
intact, in the correct sequence. The
redundancy increases flexibility, availability,
and resilience. “A method of routing traffic
through split cable facilities or duplicate
cable facilities. Notes: This can be
accomplished with different or duplicate
cable sheaths. If different cable sheaths are
used, the cable may be in the same conduit
and, therefore, subject to the same
interruptions as the cable it is backing up.
The communication service subscriber can
duplicate the facilities by having alternate
routes, although the entrance to and from the
customer premises may be in the same
conduit. The subscriber can obtain diverse
routing and alternate routing, including dual
entrance facilities, from the local carrier.
```

```
However, acquiring this type of access is
time-consuming and costly. Most carriers
provide facilities for alternate and diverse
routing, although the majority of services
are transmitted over terrestrial media, which
are usually located in the ground or
basement. Ground-based facilities are at
great risk due to the aging infrastructures of
cities. In addition, cable-based facilities
usually share space with mechanical and
electrical systems that can pose great risk
due to potential human error and disasters”

Domain name “A domain name locates an organization or

domain name ‘www.sans.org’ locates an
Internet address for ‘sans.org’ at Internet
point 199.0.0.2 and a particular host server
named ‘www.’ The ‘org’ part of the domain
name reflects the purpose of the
organization or entity (in this example,
‘organization’) and is called the top-level
domain name. The ‘sans’ part of the domain
name defines the organization or entity and
together with the top-level is called the
second-level domain name” (SANS

```
Attack that subverts D omain N ame S ystem
servers or records to direct victims covertly
to a malicious domain, phishing or
infectious website, etc. instead of the benign
one they anticipated, e.g. by ‘poisoning’
cached DNS data with false linkages or by
exploiting the ‘zone transfer’ process used to
share data among DNS servers. “Corrupts
the table of an Internet server’s DNS,
replacing an Internet address with the
address of a vagrant or scoundrel address.
Notes: If a web user looks for the page with
that address, the request is redirected by the
scoundrel entry in the table to a different
address. Cache poisoning differs from
another form of DNS poisoning in which the
attacker spoofs valid email accounts and
floods the in-boxes of administrative and
technical contacts. Cache poisoning is
related to URL poisoning or location
poisoning, in which an Internet user’s
behavior is tracked by adding an
identification number to the location line of
the browser that can be recorded as the user
visits successive pages on the site” (ISACA

slowest person to pass through ( e.g. a card
access-controlled office door propped open
for some reason may sound an annoying
local ‘peeper’ and/or a silent/remote alarm
in the security guard house). Electronic
door-open alarms may be manually
overridden or silenced for authorised
purposes such as office moves or refits, but
such overrides should preferably trigger
indicators (such as a flashing warning light),
automated reminders, or
cancellation/timeouts to prevent them being
forgotten and left in effect beyond the

```
Failover, fail-over Manual or automated process for transferring the
provision of resilient information services between
redundant equipment, campuses, and/or
communication paths following a failure, increasing
service availability and hopefully avoiding unplanned
interruptions, thereby averting more serious incidents.
“The capability to switch over automatically (typically
without human intervention or warning) to a redundant
or standby information system upon the failure or
abnormal termination of the previously active system”
(CNSSI 4009 ). “The transfer of service from an
incapacitated primary component to its backup
component” (ISACA glossary).
```
**Failsafe, fail-safe, fail-
secure, fail-closed**

```
Engineering principle/approach used heavily in safety-
critical (vital) and other high-security system and
process architectures whereby a control failure or some
adverse situation leaves the system/process in an
inherently safe or secure – albeit perhaps only partially
functional – state or condition. “Pertaining to
avoidance of compromise in the event of a failure”
(ISO/IEC 2382 ). “A system or component that
automatically places itself in a safe operational mode
in the event of a failure” (IEEE). See also secure-by-
default, secure-by-design, P ower- O n S elf- T est.
```
```
Fail-soft, failsoft, fail-
gracefully, fail-gently
```
```
Resilience arrangement that identifies impending
performance/capacity constraints or other operational
issues and responds dynamically by, for instance, de-
prioritising relatively unimportant activities, shedding
non-critical loads, or requesting additional resources in
the hope of avoiding incidents. “Pertaining to a
functional unit continuing to function in a degraded
mode despite faults or manual out-of-limits operations.
Note: Fault tolerance is a means for achieving failsoft
operations” (ISO/IEC 2382 ). “Selective termination of
affected nonessential processing when hardware or
software failure is determined to be imminent” (CNSSI
4009 ). See also fault tolerance.

**Fail-unsafe, fail-
unsecure, fail-insecure,
fail-open**

```
Undesirable state for systems and processes that have
not been explicitly designed to be safe and secure ( i.e.
failsafe) under all conditions, and hence are ‘fragile’,
e.g. an access control that fails spontaneously or is
actively disabled or bypassed in an attack, may permit
inappropriate access that it was supposed to have
prevented or at least detected. In the absence of
compensating controls, security by obscurity can fail
spectacularly if details of a supposedly obscure
vulnerability are widely disclosed.
```
```
Failure Unplanned, unintended, unwelcome, and generally
problematic situation, occurrence, event, or incident.
“The inability of a system or component to perform its
functions within specified performance requirements”
(IEEE).

Failure analysis Analysis of evidence relating to a failure in order to
diagnose and determine the cause/s or factors that
caused it ... or that failed to prevent it (a different class
of failure). “Determining the exact nature and location
of a program error to fix the error, to identify and fix
other similar errors and to initiate corrective action to
prevent future occurrences of this type of error.

thinking,’ faithful people believe in something without
requiring hard evidence of its validity and veracity,
sometimes to the point of ignoring or flatly and
irrationally denying credible evidence to the contrary.

Fingerprint Literally, the print mark left behind on a surface by a
finger, a biometric. Often used figuratively to indicate
characteristics that uniquely identify a person ( e.g.
using DNA profiling), system, or data. Despite
theoretical claims as to their uniqueness, gathering and
analysing any kind of fingerprint create practical
constraints on the achievable accuracy; hence, there is
a small but finite possibility that fingerprints from
different individuals, systems, or data may not be
distinguished in practice. Furthermore, being
biometrics, confidentiality is a challenge for the owner,
especially as they cannot be changed if compromised,

evidence to be presented in court. More than merely a
duplication of an item of forensic evidence, a forensic
copy is produced using a specified, forensically sound
method that gives an extremely high level of assurance
that the copy is an authentic and complete duplicate of
the original, e.g. a bitwise image of a computer disk,
created using proven and trustworthy forensic tools,
with a cryptographic hash value identical to the
original. “A bit-for-bit reproduction of the information
contained on an electronic device or associated media,
whose validity and integrity has been verified using an

change, and ideally improve as a collaborative
public/community effort. ‘Free’ refers to liberty, not
necessarily price: some FOSS suppliers, for instance,
provide additional chargeable services such as
professional support and patching. “Software the

made available under a free and open-source licence
which provides for all rights to make it freely
accessible, usable, modifiable and redistributable” (EU

measure that estimates how often the same event might
occur” (OCEG GRC Glossary).
```
```
Frequency analysis Basic cryptanalytic technique using the distribution of
individual characters, character sequences, or words in
typical plaintext to guess at possible substitutions in
ciphertext or code, e.g. e and i are the most frequent
letters in most English texts, while an , in , on , to , and of
are very common two-, three-, or four-character
sequences (allowing for the usual leading and trailing
spaces).
```
**Frequency-hopping** Transmissions on a radio that automatically follows a
rapidly changing cryptographically determined
sequence of spot frequencies, making it harder or
impossible for unauthorised listeners using basic radio
receivers to reconstruct the complete transmission as
opposed to authorised listeners using receivers
programmed to follow the same frequency sequence.
“Repeated switching of frequencies during radio
transmission according to a specified algorithm, to

glossary). Cf. nonfunctional requirement.
```
```
Functional safety “The detection of a potentially dangerous condition

Synonymous with black-box testing and input/output
driven testing. Contrasts with testing, structural”
_(ISACA glossary)._ See also load test.

```
Fuzzing, fuzz testing Software security assurance method (a form of black
box testing) typically using large volumes of generated
data to verify processing and application controls
around boundary conditions, perhaps identifying
vulnerabilities or other inappropriate system
behaviours such as undefined internal states or
conditions. “A method used to discover errors or
potential security vulnerabilities in software”
(AusISM). “Similar to fault injection in that invalid
data is input into the application via the environment,
or input by one process into another process. Fuzz
testing is implemented by tools called fuzzers, which
are programs or script that submit some combination
of inputs to the test target to reveal how it responds”
(NIST SP 800-95). “The use of special regression
testing tools to generate out-of-spec input for an
application in order to find security vulnerabilities”

**Gardening leave** Workers in the course of leaving an
organisation’s employment or
engagement/assignment may be explicitly
excluded by management from the premises and
its networks/systems, _etc_. This enforced paid
leave mitigates unacceptable insider risks,
particularly if they were in privileged/trusted
positions with extensive access to information
and other valuable corporate assets and/or if
their competence, loyalty, or trustworthiness is
in doubt ( _e.g._ dismissals). ‘Sending them home
to do the gardening’ may be deemed less
risky/costly than allowing them to work
normally during their notice periods.

atomic clocks, allowing a receiver to calculate
its three-dimensional position (latitude,
longitude, and altitude) to within a few meters
by simultaneous reference to several satellite
signals. A GNSS receiver unit in a vehicle, for
instance, can track the vehicle’s position and
report it remotely if coupled with a radio
transmitter such as a cellphone, creating
surveillance capabilities and raising privacy
implications. Vulnerable to interference caused
by physical obstructions, electrical noise, solar
flares, etc., or to deliberate spoofing or
jamming. A useful way of tracking valuable
portable information assets such as backup tape
carriers, missiles, executives, politicians,

directing, and controlling corporate decision-
making and activities, while leaving enough
room for creativity, innovation, and self-
determination/autonomy (implying a degree of
tolerance and trust in the management structures
and managers). Includes enterprise-wide
corporate governance and subsidiary aspects
such as project governance and information
security governance. A broad, high-level
integrity control that flexes with the business,
adapting dynamically to keep things heading the
right way. “Human-based system comprising
directing, overseeing and accountability”
(ISO/IEC 38500). “The method by which an

Hack, hacking At MIT in the late 1950’s, a ‘hack’ was an
ingenious, quick, inelegant, and superficial
modification to a system that accomplished
the desired goal without fundamentally
changing its architecture. Later came to
mean a benign and obsessive fascination
with technology. Now refers to accessing,
exploring, and often exploiting vulnerable
computer systems, networks, and things
without the owners’ authorisation,
knowledge, and/or permission; hence,
unethical and often both malicious and
illegal, although cracking is more specific.
“Intentionally accessing a computer system
without the authorization of the user or the
owner” (ISO/IEC 27032).

```
Characteristic output value produced by
passing a string or file (the ‘message’)
through a so-called ‘one-way encryption’ or
‘trapdoor’ cryptographic hashing function
such as SHA-2. Although the original
content may not be reliably recreated from
the hash value, its validity and integrity can
be verified by recalculating and comparing
the hash against one calculated previously,
stored, and communicated securely. Used to
validate passwords, digital certificates,
digital evidence, plus electronic files,
messages, functions, and transactions, and
for pseudorandom bit generation.
“Encryption that produces ciphertext from
which the original data cannot be
reproduced. Note: Irreversible encryption is
useful in authentication. For example, a
password might be irreversibly encrypted
and the resulting ciphertext stored. A
password presented later would be
irreversibly encrypted identically and the
two strings of ciphertext compared. If they
are identical, the presented password is
correct” (ISO/IEC 2382 ). “[Hashing] 1. A
technique involving using a hash function
(algorithm) to create hash valued or
checksums that validate message integrity.
```
2. In data processing and machine learning,
a mechanism for bucketing categorical data,
particularly when the number of categories
is large, but the number of categories
actually appearing in the dataset is
comparatively small. [and] [Hash] A


cryptographic function takes an input of an
arbitrary length and produces an output
(also known as a message digest) that is a
standard-sized binary string. The output is
unique to the input in such a way that even a
minor change to the input results in a
completely different output. Modern
cryptographic hash functions are also
resistant to collisions (situations in which
different inputs produce identical output); a
collision, while possible, is statistically
improbable. Cryptographic hash functions
are developed so that input cannot be
determined readily from the output. [and]
[Hash function] 1. An algorithm that maps
or translates one set of bits into another
(generally smaller) so that a message yields
the same result every time the algorithm is
executed using the same message as input.

2. Fixed values derived mathematically
from a text message” _(ISACA glossary)._
“The result of a one-way, cryptographic
function that converts a data string of any
length into a unique fixed-length bit string.
Typically applied to passwords and
messages to protect against loss and/or add
resistance to attacks. Hashing algorithms or
functions are often are designed as a one-
way cryptographic transformation so that
it’s impossible to reverse the hash process
and reconstitute the original string. The
values returned by a hash function are
variously described as hash values, hash
codes, digests, or simply hashes. One
common use of a hash is a data structure
called a hash table, widely used in computer
software for indexing and rapid retrieval of


```
database elements. Note that a hash is not
the same as data encryption although it does
utilise cryptographic functions” (NZISM).
“An algorithm (the hash function) which
takes as input a string of any length (the
message) and generates a fixed length string
(the message digest or fingerprint) as
output. The algorithm is designed to make it
computationally infeasible to find any input
which maps to a given digest, or to find two
different messages that map to the same
digest” (AusISM). “The process of using a
mathematical algorithm against data to
produce a numeric value that is
representative of that data” (NIST SP 800-
101 ). “An algorithm that computes a value
based on a data object thereby mapping the
data object to a smaller data object.
(Cryptographic) hash functions are used to
generate a one way ‘check sum’ for a larger
text, which is not trivially reversed. The
result of this hash function can be used to
validate if a larger file has been altered,
without having to compare the larger files to
each other. Frequently used hash functions
are MD5 and SHA1” (SANS glossary).

code (MAC) using a cryptographic hash
function and a cryptographic key” (NZISM).
```

**Hash collision** It is possible, although unlikely, for two

```
different input strings or files to produce the
same hash due to the finite number of
possible hash values that hashing algorithms
generate (the hash-space). Relatively weak
hashing algorithms such as MD5 with small
hash-spaces are more likely to suffer
collisions and are deprecated in favour of
stronger algorithms with much larger hash-
spaces such as the SHA-2 or SHA-3
families. “Occurrence of the same hash

```
**Hysteresis [loop]** Feature of controls designed to keep a
measured parameter (such as pressure)
within a defined tolerance range rather than
attempting to maintain a setpoint precisely.
The parameter cycles between upper and
lower limits, giving the control (such as
running a pump or opening a relief valve)
more time to act. Plotting the controlled
parameter against time gives two sigmoid
curves that separate between the increasing
and decreasing phases, forming a loop with
some lag or slack in the control action.
Helps prevent the control oscillating too
rapidly about the start/stop setpoint,
stressing, and perhaps prematurely wearing
out mechanical switches, relays, motors,
_etc_. at the cost of reduced precision.

**Identity fraud, identity
theft**

```
Type of fraud in which the fraudster masquerades
as, impersonates, or falsely assumes the victim’s
identity, typically as a prelude to stealing or
misappropriating financial or other assets such as
confidential information. Often involves theft ( e.g.
using infostealer malware), falsification
(counterfeiting or faking), or guessing of
credentials used to authenticate the holder’s
claimed identity, exploiting I dentification &
A uthentication vulnerabilities, and
misrepresentation.
```
```
Identity theft See identity fraud. Strictly speaking, the theft of
personal information is just the first step and
sometimes it is not even stolen but willingly
provided or disclosed by data subjects for some
reason ( e.g. on a typical LinkedIn profile or
C urriculum V itae).

Idle standby “A fail-over process in which the primary node
owns the resource group and the backup node runs
idle, only supervising the primary node. Notes: In
case of a primary node outage, the backup node
takes over. The nodes are prioritized, which means
that the surviving node with the highest priority
will acquire the resource group. A higher priority
node joining the cluster will thus cause a short
service interruption” (ISACA glossary).

motivating them have to be balanced against the
possibility of eroding the very qualities that led to
their being employed, and overloading them at the
start. In practice, the process extends well beyond
the typical H uman R esources-led training session
as newcomers interact with their new managers,
peers, and other colleagues, gradually becoming
assimilated into the team and corporate culture and
hopefully security-aware.

organization itself for management review and
other internal purposes, and which can form the
basis for an organization’s self-declaration of
conformity. Note: In many cases, particularly in
smaller organizations, independence can be
demonstrated by the freedom from responsibility
for the activity being audited” (ISO 22300). “An
independent, objective assurance and advisory
service designed to add value and improve an
organization’s operations. It helps an organization
accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic,

wide system of governance and management
activities intended to ensure that the organisation
achieves its objectives in a controlled manner,
overcoming risks by design and intent (deliberately
and systematically reducing uncertainties) rather
than by sheer good fortune. “The policies,
procedures, practices and organizational structures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that
business objectives will be achieved and undesired
events will be prevented or detected and corrected”

one is invulnerable to something itself constitutes a
vulnerability to unanticipated modes of attack or
compromise, as well as control failures and
mistaken risk analysis. Absolute security is literally
unattainable, an oxymoron.

Kerberos Cryptographic I dentification &
A uthentication protocol or architecture
developed by MIT. “A means of verifying
the identities of principals on an open
network. It accomplishes this without
relying on the authentication,
trustworthiness, or physical security of hosts
while assuming all packets can be read,
modified and inserted at will. It uses a trust
broker model and symmetric cryptography
to provide authentication and authorization
of users and systems on the network” (NIST
SP 800-95). “A system developed at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology that
depends on passwords and symmetric
cryptography (DES) to implement ticket-
based, peer entity authentication service and
access control service distributed in a client-
server network environment” (SANS
glossary).
```
**Kerckhoffs’ principle** In ~1883, Auguste Kerchchoffs wrote “The

```
design of a system should not require
secrecy and compromise of the system
should not inconvenience the
correspondents ” ; in other words it should be
irrelevant whether a cryptographic
algorithm or cryptosystem (as distinct from
the key) is disclosed or published. Inspired
Claude Shannon’s maxim “The enemy
knows the system.” Note: competent
professional scrutiny of a cryptosystem
(which implies its disclosure) is an
important assurance control since “Anyone
```

```
can invent a security system that he himself
cannot break” (Schneier’s law, an example
of the Dunning–Kruger effect).

Kernel Tasty core protected by the hard outer shell
of a nut. O perating S ystem kernels handle
critical functions, including many low-level
privileged security functions such as
mediating access to memory pages, storage,
and peripheral devices, plus security
logging and alerting. If the kernel protection
is compromised ( e.g. by malware or
hackers), system security is largely if not
totally negated. “The essential center of a
computer operating system, the core that
provides basic services for all other parts of
the operating system. A synonym is nucleus.
A kernel can be contrasted with a shell, the
outermost part of an operating system that
interacts with user commands. Kernel and
shell are terms used more frequently in
Unix and some other operating systems than
in IBM mainframe systems” (SANS

**Latency, dwell time** Delay, _e.g._ the pregnant pause between a

```
message (a data packet) being sent from one
system onto a network connection and its
delivery to the destination system – a
combination of the time taken for physical
transit between the ends at something
approaching the speed of light, and the
processing involved in message
transmission and reception. In some
contexts ( e.g. disk drives and C entral
P rocessing U nits), latency may include the
time taken to acknowledge, process, and
respond to messages, commands,
transactions, etc. In networking, latency
generally excludes the time taken to
establish or tear down a semi-persistent
link, only measuring message transit times.
Latency constrains the achievable
speed/performance and responsiveness and
relates to the capacity/throughput of the
mechanisms used ( e.g. parallel vs. serial
data, fibre-optic vs. satellite links). “The
time it takes a system or network to
respond. Notes: More specifically, system

specifying various security controls the
insured organisations are required to have in
place.

Network address Similar to an email or postal address, identifies the
source/origin and/or destination/target nodes,
computer systems, or networks for
datacommunications messages. Used for network
routing, management, logging, tracing/tracking,
broadcasting, etc. Specified in most network
protocols. For obvious reasons, should be
unambiguous for efficient delivery and unique
within a given network to avoid conflict and
confusion. For security reasons, may require
authentication to mitigate the risk of spoofing.

T ranslation (NAT)
```
```
Basic firewall, router, or server function to spoof
public I nternet P rotocol addresses externally on
packets originating within a private internal
network, without breaking various network
protocols. Keeping internal IP addresses
confidential makes it slightly harder for Internet
hackers to discover and map the internal network
architecture, and allows additional security, e.g.
raising the alarm if packets with internal IP
addresses appear on the public side of the NAT
server, indicating a possible breach/incident or a
firewall configuration failure. “A methodology for
modifying network address information in IP
datagram packet headers while they are in transit
across a traffic routing device for the purpose of
remapping one IP address space into another”
(ISACA glossary). “[NAT] is used to share one or a
small number of publicly routable IP addresses
among a larger number of hosts. The hosts are
assigned private IP addresses, which are then
‘translated’ into one of the publicly routed IP
addresses. Typically home or small business
networks use NAT to share a single DLS or Cable
modem IP address. However, in some cases NAT
is used for servers as an additional layer of
protection. [and] The translation of an Internet

I ntrusion D etection S ystem involving monitoring
all the network traffic traversing the cables or

network traffic destined for or generated by a
particular servers or nodes (see H ost-based
I ntrusion D etection S ystem). “A network-based
IDS system monitors the traffic on its network
segment as a data source. This is generally
accomplished by placing the network interface
card in promiscuous mode to capture all network
traffic that crosses its network segment. Network
traffic on other segments, and traffic on other
means of communication (like phone lines) can’t
be monitored. Network-based IDS involves
looking at the packets on the network as they pass
by some sensor. The sensor can only see the
packets that happen to be carried on the network
segment it’s attached to. Packets are considered to
be of interest if they match a signature. Network-
based intrusion detection passively monitors
network activity for indications of attacks.
Network monitoring offers several advantages
over traditional host-based intrusion detection

**N** eural **N** etwork **(NN),
neural net, artificial

```
Machine learning model originally inspired by the
structure of the brain with layers of interconnected
nodes (mathematical functions representing
neurons). The outputs of one layer are input to the
next. Connections between nodes are weighted as
the network learns from training data. Weights are
trained by backpropagation, an algorithm that
calculates the error of the network’s output and
adjusts the weights accordingly. “Network of
primitive processing elements connected by
weighted links with adjustable weights, in which
each element produces a value by applying a
nonlinear function to its input values, and
transmits it to other elements or presents it as an
output. Notes: Neural networks are modeled on
the functioning of neurons in the nervous system.
The nonlinear function is usually a threshold
function” (ISO/IEC 2382 ). “Network of one or
more layers of neurons connected by weighted
links with adjustable weights, which takes input
data and produces an output. Notes: Neural
networks are a prominent example of the
connectionist approach; Although the design of
neural networks was initially inspired by the
functioning of biological neurons, most works on
neural networks do not follow that inspiration
anymore” (ISO/IEC 22989). “Networks, inspired
by the structure of the human brain, that learn by
processing data through three layers (input,
hidden, and output). They can be trained to match
any input to various outputs, including binary
ones, making them versatile tools in deep learning

A greement (NDA)
```
```
Understanding, perhaps contractual and legally
binding, between two or more parties to share
confidential information ( I ntellectual P roperty that
may be proprietary, personal, or official) between
themselves but not to disclose it to third parties
except by mutual authorisation, or unless legally
obliged to do so. May not expressly prohibit the
recipient from exploiting the information
themselves, although most Westerners would
consider that unethical and inappropriate. “A legal
contract between at least two parties that outlines
confidential materials the parties wish to share
with one another for certain purposes but wish to
restrict from generalized use; a contract through
```

```
which the parties agree not to disclose information
covered by the agreement. Notes: Also called a
confidential disclosure agreement (CDA),
confidentiality agreement or secrecy agreement,
an NDA creates a confidential relationship
between the parties to protect any type of trade
secret. As such, an NDA can protect non-public
business information. In the case of certain
governmental entities, the confidentiality of
information other than trade secrets may be
subject to applicable statutory requirements, and in
some cases must be revealed to an outside party
requesting the information. Generally, the
governmental entity will include a provision in the
contract to allow the seller to review a request for
information that the seller identifies as
confidential and the seller may appeal such a
decision requiring disclosure. NDAs are
commonly signed when two companies or
individuals are considering doing business
together and need to understand the processes used
in one another’s businesses solely for the purpose
of evaluating the potential business relationship.
NDAs can be ‘mutual,’ meaning that both parties
are restricted in their use of the materials provided,
or they can only restrict a single party. It is also
possible for an employee to sign an NDA or NDA-
like agreement with a company at the time of
hiring; in fact, some employment agreements will
include a clause restricting ‘confidential
information’ in general” (ISACA glossary).

Parity Literally, equivalence. In
datacommunications and data storage, a
crude, low-cost data integrity control
involves simply appending an extra bit to
each byte or word such that the numeric
sums of all the bits are even (even parity) or
odd (odd parity). Later, if the calculated
sum does not remain even or odd,
respectively, it appears that at least one bit
must have changed. “A general hardware
control that helps to detect data errors when
data are read from memory or
communicated from one computer to
another. Notes: A 1-bit digit (either 0 or 1) is
added to a data item to indicate whether the
sum of that data item’s bit is odd or even.
When the parity bit disagrees with the sum
of the other bits, the computer reports an
error. The probability of a parity check
detecting an error is 50 percent” (ISACA
glossary). See also C yclic R edundancy

Passkey Digital credential for FIDO M ulti F actor
A uthentication using asymmetric
cryptography in which a user’s private keys
are generally stored in a secure subsystem
or vault on the user’s personal device, such
as a smartphone. The user first authenticates
to the device using a USB hardware token,
biometric, PIN code, or password to unlock
the stored private keys, then uses the
relevant key to authenticate (logon) to a
website or app that has been designed to
accept passkeys, having first authenticated
the website or app using its public key to
```

```
reduce the possibility of being phished. For
convenience across devices (albeit at some
risk), passkeys may also be synchronised
and stored in the cloud, while FIDO
Security Keys allow recovery of lost
passkeys.
```
```
Passphrase Confidential phrase, sentence, saying, lyric,
poem, etc. that is either used directly as a
long and hence strong password, or is used
as a prompt to recall one ( e.g. forming a

Password Confidential string of characters (ideally not
a recognisable word or phrase) which can
authenticate a person or system as a

inappropriately ( e.g. due to ignorance,
carelessness, social engineering, or
coercion). “A protected, generally

single-factor or multi-factor, with the later
often referred to as passwordless multi-

User authentication using multiple factors
(credentials) of different kinds other than
passwords, e.g. biometrics and security
tokens. “Multi-factor authentication using
something users have that is unlocked by
something users know or are. Note, while a
memorised secret may be used as part of
passwordless multi-factor authentication

private key stored on a device) it is not the
primary authentication factor, hence the use
of the passwordless terminology” (AusISM).
```
```
Password-protected Although this dismissive phrase implies the
use of strong cryptographic controls, critical
details such as password complexity rules
and algorithms are rarely specified. In
practice, paradoxically, it usually indicates a
basic and rather weak form of user
authentication, barely better than nothing.

them all, but naturally if the password is
compromised at any point, all the systems
are at risk of being accessed improperly.
Deprecated in favour of more sophisticated
controls such as S ingle S ign O n, password

```
Password vault Trusted program and/or hardware designed
to store passwords, cryptographic keys, PIN
codes, userIDs, and other credentials or
highly confidential pieces of information
securely (meaning encrypted using a key
derived from the one strong password or
passphrase that the user must remember),
and regurgitate them on demand by the
authorised user when logging on to the
relevant systems or websites. Good
password vaults help the user generate
much stronger ( i.e. longer and more
complex) passwords or passphrases than
anyone other than a memory freak can
manage and store reliably in their heads,
limited only by the constraints of the target
systems. Bad password vaults may be rogue
software, Trojans, or spyware, and may
have architectural flaws and bugs creating
security vulnerabilities.

updates, patches seldom offer additional
functionality. Occasionally because of
inadequate quality assurance, they may even
cause additional problems, requiring further
corrections (more patches!) or workarounds

the pointers on a DNS server, the URL can
be redirected to send traffic to the IP of the

transactions can be mimicked and
information like login credentials can be

(meaning there is absolutely no possibility
whatsoever, ever) and one (it is absolutely

defined timescale), vague terms such as
likelihood, possibility, chance, and luck are
used informally in everyday language in
reference to uncertainty, unpredictability,
often implying the speaker’s inability to
influence or determine the outcome (‘fate’).
“Measure of the chance of occurrence
expressed as a number from 0 to 1, where 0
is impossibility and 1 is absolute certainty”

kinds of risk. “A failed IT project that poses
a significant risk to an enterprise,
manifesting as lost market share, failure to
seize new opportunities or other adverse

**Promiscuous mode** Datacommunications devices such as
Ethernet and Wi-Fi cards routinely ignore
passing network packets that are not
addressed to their unique network or device
addresses, and are not broadcast or
multicast packets, discarding them at a low
level. When configured in promiscuous
mode, however, even packets destined for
other devices are passed up the network
stack, _e.g._ to a sniffer where any
unencrypted content may be read. “Allows
the network interface to capture all network
traffic irrespective of the hardware device to
which the packet is addressed” _(ISACA
glossary)._ “When a machine reads all

P roof of S take (PoS) Blockchain approach used by
cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, in
which ‘minters’ or ‘validators’ can only add
new cryptocoins to the blockchain if they
already hold a substantial number of
bitcoins, giving them a material stake and
hence self-interest in maintaining the
integrity of the system. “A type of
consensus algorithm by which a
cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to
achieve distributed consensus. In PoS
consensus, the creator of the next block of
data is chosen via several combinations of
random selection and wealth or age ( i.e ., the
stake) within the blockchain. With PoS,
miners can mine or validate block
transactions based on amount of
cryptocurrency a miner holds. PoS was
created as an alternative to PoW, which
requires large amounts of energy. PoS gives
mining power based on the percentage of
cryptocurrency held by a miner. It is seen as
less risky in terms of network attacks and
security and used only for public
blockchains” (ISACA glossary). Cf. P roof o f

```
**P** roof of **W** ork **(PoW)** Blockchain approach used by

cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, in which
miners have to prove (cryptographically) to

```

```
substantial amount of computational effort
(and energy) to mine (create) new
cryptocoins, while validation takes minimal
effort. “PoW is conducted through miners
(participants who keep the blockchain
running by providing computing resources)
who are competing to solve a cryptographic
problem ( i.e ., hash puzzle). The PoW
algorithm is used to confirm transactions
and produce new blocks which are added to
the chain. With PoW, miners compete
against each other to complete transactions
on the network and get rewarded. The
computational work required to accomplish
this is fairly (and usually increasingly)
difficult for miners to perform, but easy for
the network to verify. As difficulty increases
over time, the amount of computational
power, and hence, energy consumption,
grows. Bitcoin is the first widespread
application use of PoW. PoW is applicable
to public blockchains” (ISACA glossary).

therefore the maximum tolerable data loss
prior to the incident. Has implications for
both the business and the backup strategy,
e.g. the frequency of offsite backups. “Point
in time to which data are to be recovered
after a disruption has occurred” (ISO/IEC
27002 ). “Point to which information used
by an activity is restored to enable the
activity to operate on resumption. Note: Can
also be referred to as ’maximum data loss’”
(ISO 22300). “The earliest point in time that

( _e.g._ with strong links to change
management). “An approach by an
enterprise that will ensure its recovery and

Requirement Something that is desired, wanted, expected,
or demanded. Ideally developed by a formal
requirements analysis process involving
thorough and competent needs analysis,
then explicitly and formally specified and
documented for clarity, review, and
approval/authorisation before being used.
Can be categorised as functional or
nonfunctional. “Essential condition that a
system has to satisfy” (ISO/IEC 2382 ).
“Need or expectation that is stated,
generally implied or obligatory. Notes:
‘Generally implied’ means that it is custom
or common practice for the organisation and
interested parties that the need or
expectation under consideration is implied.
A specified requirement is one that is stated,
for example in documented information”
(ISO/IEC 27000 ). “1. A condition or
capability needed by a user to solve a
problem or achieve an objective. 2. A
condition or capability that must be met or

```
Risk In general, uncertainty relating to a
particular context, scenario, situation,
circumstance, asset, threat, vulnerability,
impact, outcome, consequence, etc.
Expressed mathematically,
```

precisely/absolutely, and objectively as a
probability value or range less than 1
(meaning absolute certainty), or
subjectively in imprecise, vague, and
relative terms such as doubt, ambiguity,
potential, possibility, or likelihood. Can be
reduced to some extent by risk analysis and
mitigation through controls as part of risk
management, but in practice there is
inevitably some residual risk, leading to
concerns, fears, indecision, reluctance to
commit, _etc_. In relation to information, the
predicted or projected frequency and
magnitude of future loss if a threat were to
exploit an exposed vulnerability, causing
adverse business, personal, social,
environmental or other impacts. Expressed
either in relative terms, implying degrees or
levels of risk, or as absolute values over a
defined period, preferably with specified
tolerances or margins for error given the
uncertainties. Information security controls
seldom eliminate information risks; hence,
other risk treatments (such as accepting
residual risks) are also appropriate.
“Possibility that a particular threat will
exploit a particular vulnerability of a data
processing system” _(ISO/IEC 2382 )._ “Effect
of uncertainty. Notes: An effect is a
deviation from the expected — positive or
negative. Uncertainty is the state, even
partial, of deficiency of information related
to, understanding or knowledge of, an
event, its consequence, or likelihood. Risk
is often characterized by reference to
potential events ... and consequences ... or
a combination of these. Risk is often


```
expressed in terms of a combination of the
consequences of an event (including
changes in circumstances) and the
associated likelihood ... of occurrence”
(ISO/IEC 42001 ). “A measure of the
negative, unfavorable effect of uncertainty
on objectives” (OCEG GRC Glossary).
“Combination of the probability of
occurrence of harm and the severity of that
harm” (ISO/IEC Guide 51 ). “The
combination of the likelihood of an event

measure of the extent to which an entity is
threatened by a potential circumstance or

```
**Risk acceptance** Management or personal decision to live

```
with rather than mitigate, share, or avoid a
risk. A form of risk treatment. Ideally such a
decision should be made explicitly
(consciously and deliberately) by a well-
informed, competent, and responsible
person who truly appreciates the
implications but, in practice, risks are often
accepted implicitly (without thinking)
and/or without being recognised and fully

understood, which itself constitutes a further
risk. “Managerial decision to accept a
certain degree of risk, usually for technical
or cost reasons” (ISO/IEC 2382 ). “Informed
decision to take a particular risk. Notes:
Risk acceptance can occur without risk
treatment or during the process of risk
treatment; Accepted risks are subject to
monitoring and review” (ISO/IEC 27005 ).
“A decision to accept a risk, made according
to the risk appetite and risk tolerance set by

**Risk aggregation** Association or linking of risks relevant to
the subject of analysis. Although risks may
be acceptable when considered individually
( _e.g_. blackouts and data centre fires, each
mitigated by controls), the cumulative
effects with dependencies and common or
compounding factors ( _e.g_. power failure
disabling data centre sprinklers, and fires
disabling power systems) may be
unacceptable. “Combination of a number of
risks into one risk to develop a more

estimation” _(ISO/IEC 27005 )._ “1. A process
by which the frequency and magnitude of
IT risk scenarios are estimated. 2. The initial
steps of risk management: analyzing the
value of assets to the business, identifying
threats to those assets and evaluating how

```
Risk appetite Expresses senior management’s willingness
or desire for the organisation to take
(accept) a specified quantity, volume, or
level of risk, provided that (in their opinion)
the likelihood of achieving business
objectives and hence anticipated business
benefits make it advantageous to do so.
Implies a mature, forward-thinking
business-focused strategic outlook. Often
expressed quite subtly, e.g. “We must
consolidate to protect our core business” or
conversely “We are pursuing innovative
opportunities to expand the business.”
“Amount and type of risk that an
organization is willing to pursue or retain”
(ISO/IEC 27005 ). “The amount of risk, on a
broad level, that an entity is willing to
accept in pursuit of its mission” (ISACA
glossary). “The level and type of risk the
organization is WILLING to address given
the level and type of reward it pursues”
(OCEG GRC Glossary). “The types and
amount of risk that an organization is
willing to accept in the pursuit of its
strategies and objectives” (IIA GIAS). “ The
types and amount of risk, on a board level,
an organization is willing to accept in
pursuit of value” (COSO). Cf. risk
tolerance.
```
**Risk articulation** Important part of the rôle of information
risk and security management professionals
involves describing and explaining relevant
risks and related items in terms that not only
make sense to the audiences, but inspire or
motivate them to make appropriate


```
decisions and act accordingly – going
beyond mere awareness.
```
**Risk assessment** Structured, formal process for

```
systematically examining and assessing
information security threats, vulnerabilities,
and impacts relating to a given system,
process, activity, or situation, prior to
determining whether additional controls or
other forms of risk treatment might be
necessary. “Overall process of risk
identification, risk analysis and risk
evaluation” (ISO/IEC 27005 ). “A process
used to identify and evaluate risk and its
potential effects. Notes: Risk assessments
are used to identify those items or areas that
present the highest risk, vulnerability or
exposure to the enterprise for inclusion in
the IS annual audit plan. Risk assessments
are also used to manage the project delivery
and project benefit risk” (ISACA glossary).
“The process of identifying, prioritizing,
and estimating risks. This includes
determining the extent to which adverse
circumstances or events could impact an
enterprise. Uses the results of threat and
vulnerability assessments to identify risk to
organisational operations and evaluates
those risks in terms of likelihood of
occurrence and impacts if they occur. The
product of a risk assessment is a list of
estimated potential impacts and unmitigated
vulnerabilities. Risk assessment is part of
risk management and is conducted
throughout the Risk Management
Framework (RMF)” (CNSSI 4009 ). “The
process of identifying risks to
```

```
organizational operations (including
mission, functions, image, reputation),
organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation, resulting
from the operation of a system” (NIST SP
800-171). “A scientific and technologically
based process consisting of three steps, risk
identification, risk analysis and risk
evaluation” (ENISA RM glossary). “A
structured and auditable process of
identifying potentially significant events,
assessing their likelihood and impacts, and
then combining these to provide an overall
assessment of risk, as a basis for further

```
risks associated with e-mail may be
considered ‘Risk Averse’” (SANS glossary).
```
```
Risk avoidance Form of risk treatment. Rather than
mitigating unacceptable risks using controls
or sharing them with third parties, it is
sometimes more appropriate not to enter
into risky situations in the first place ( e.g.
not deploying a risky new I nformation
T echnology system or not entering into a
risky relationship with a dubious partner) or
to pull out ( e.g. prematurely halting a risky
business venture). “Informed decision not to
be involved in, or to withdraw from, an
activity in order not to be exposed to a
particular risk. Note: Risk avoidance can be
based on the result of risk evaluation and/or
legal and regulatory obligations” (ISO

Risk treatment Method to deal with ( i.e. mitigate, share,
avoid, or accept) one or more identified
risks. “Process to modify risk. Notes: Risk
treatment can involve: avoiding the risk by
deciding not to start or continue with the
activity that gives rise to the risk; taking or
increasing risk in order to pursue an
opportunity; removing the risk source;
changing the likelihood; changing the
consequences; sharing the risk with another
party or parties (including contracts and risk
financing); and retaining the risk by
informed decision; Information security risk
treatment does not include ‘taking or
increasing risk in order to pursue an
opportunity’ but the organization can have
this option for general risk management.
Risk treatments that deal with negative
consequences are sometimes referred to as
‘risk mitigation,’ ‘risk elimination,’ ‘risk
prevention’ and ‘risk reduction.’ Risk
treatment can create new risks or modify
existing risks” (ISO/IEC 27005 ). “Measures

or cause weaker ones to fail or falter.
Conceptually and practically different to the
capability to failover, failsafe or recover,
robust systems, _etc._ are less likely to fail
and need to be restored to service: they
simply carry on working reliably, albeit
perhaps with reduced performance and/or
functionality (fallback). “Ability of a system
to maintain its level of performance under
any circumstances” _(ISO/IEC 22989 )._
“Ability of a system to resist virtual or
physical, internal or external attacks. Note:
Particularly, the ability to resist attempted
imitation, copy, intrusion or bypassing”
_(ISO 22300)._ “The degree to which a
software system or component can function
correctly in the presence of invalid inputs or


```
stressful environmental conditions” (ISACA

operate correctly and reliably across a wide
range of operational conditions, and to fail
gracefully outside of that operational range”
(CNSSI 4009).

ROCU Abbrev: R egional O rganised C rime U nit.
```
```
Rogue Someone or something at the boundaries of
social acceptability in some way, pushing or
exceeding the limits, often unauthorised and
potentially or actually malicious ( e.g. rogue
devices or things that somehow manage to
connect to a network). Potentially ‘lovable,’
to a limited extent. More likely a vagrant,
scoundrel, and outcast.
```
```
Rogue address Disinformation about the location of a
resource, such as an I nternet P rotocol
address pointing to a malicious domain,
web page, or file, surreptitiously substituted
for the legitimate address in a D omain
N ame S ystem poisoning attack.
```
**Rogue software** Free or cheap software that is advertised
and appears to be legitimate, often security-
related ( _e.g._ antivirus programs, anti-
spyware software, and password vaults), but
is itself a Trojan, spyware, or other
malware. See also **P** otentially **U** nwanted
**P** rogram.

```
Rogue system Unauthorised computer system or thing
connected illicitly to the network, perhaps a
P ersonally O wned D evice not approved for

```
installed by a spy to monitor or intercept
network traffic, perhaps to launch hacking
attacks on authorised network systems.
```
**Rogue wireless access
point**

```
Unauthorised Wi-Fi access point connected
to a network, typically installed at work by
well-meaning but naïve workers who fail to
appreciate the additional information risks
created by the wireless coverage, perhaps
not even realising that wired routers and
other devices may also have wireless
capabilities. “An unauthorised Wireless
Access Point operating outside of the

```
```
Rôle, role Main function or purpose of a worker or
person interacting with a system or
performing a process. Rôles and job
descriptions generally change less often
than the people who perform them, and
hence require less maintenance than the
individuals’ names when used in
procedures.
```
```

```
```
Access control scheme whereby users are
granted certain system, application, and/or
data access rights according to the particular
rôles they are required to perform for the
organisation and the access policy for the
information assets. Typically implemented
through some combination of group and
individual access rights, e.g. using ACLs.
“Access control based on user roles ( i.e ., a
collection of access authorizations a user
```

```
receives based on an explicit or implicit
assumption of a given role). Role
permissions may be inherited through a role
hierarchy and typically reflect the
permissions needed to perform defined
functions within an organisation. A given
role may apply to a single individual or to
several individuals” (CNSSI 4009 ). “Model
employs pre-defined roles that carry a
specific set of privileges associated with
them and to which subjects are assigned”
(NZISM). “Assigns users to roles based on

something, such as the folder structure
on a disk, the chain of digital
certificates in a P ublic K ey
I nfrastructure, of trust, or of problem
causes.
Cf. route.
```
```
Root cause Fundamental issues, reasons, or failures that
could have and perhaps did lead to, or failed
to prevent, or might yet cause, an incident.
Failing to identify and deal with the root
```

```
causes (plural!) is a common reason for
recurring incidents, but even if they are
identified, some root causes can be difficult
to remedy, so tend to persist. “The
underlying source of a defect or problem”
(ISACA glossary). “Core issue or underlying
reason for the difference between the
criteria and the condition of an activity
under review” (IIA GIAS).
```
**Root cause analysis** Systematic and thorough determination and

```
examination of root causes. “A process of
diagnosis to establish the origins of events
that can be used for learning from
consequences, typically from errors and
problems” (ISACA glossary). “A principle-

I nformation T echnology system,
normally by hacking it or installing a
rootkit.
b. Vulgar term for sexual intercourse.
Cf. routing.
```
**Rootkit** Hacker toolset typically containing malware

```
such as Trojans used to take and retain full
control of a compromised computer system.
Often includes hacked variants of normal
O perating S ystem or utility programs with
backdoors and other covert functions to
conceal the compromise and persist. May be
surreptitiously installed at any stage of the
S oftware or S ystem D evelopment
L ife C ycle, including during manufacture
(perhaps inserted by the authorities or
spooks for national security reasons).
Usually hidden deep in the system kernel,
device drivers, firmware, or microcode, and
may actively evade detection ( e.g. by
manipulating the system calls and functions
used for folder/file listings), hence very
hard to identify and eradicate. “A software
suite designed to aid an intruder in gaining
unauthorized administrative access to a
computer system” (ISACA glossary). “A
collection of tools (programs) that a hacker

ROT13 Trivial, extremely weak substitution
function that simply ‘rotates’ each character
in the plaintext 13 positions through the
letters of the normal English alphabet
arranged in a circle. Since there are 26
letters in the alphabet, ROT13 has the
equally trivial advantage of being reversible
simply by repeating the same process.
Barely adequate for naughty kids to conceal
rude words from their elders.
```
```
Round a. Cycle. Most cryptographic algorithms
repeat steps such as transposition and
substitution several times in a specific
sequence: each run through the
sequence is called a round.
b. Approximation process to reduce the
precision of a number, typically for
convenience. According to the
mathematical function chosen for the
purpose, numbers may be rounded up
(increased to the next higher round or
whole number), rounded down
(reduced to the next lower round or
whole number), or rounded off (moved
up or down to the nearest round or
whole number, possibly with a rule to
handle a middle value consistently).
```
```
Route See communication path.
```
**Router, routing** Network device that forwards traffic

```
towards its destination via appropriate paths
through a network. Using protocols such as
```

```
B order G ateway P rotocol, a router builds,
shares, and maintains its internal routing
tables with pertinent details of paths ( e.g.
the number of hops through intermediate
routers, and transit time/delay) and their
status (up and stable, unstable or down).
“Functional unit that establishes a path
through one or more computer networks.
Note: In computer networks conforming to
the OSI model, a router operates at the
network layer” (ISO/IEC 2382 ). “Network
device that is used to establish and control
the flow of data between different networks
by selecting paths or routes based upon
routing protocol mechanisms and
algorithms. Notes: The networks can
themselves be based on different protocols.
The routing information is kept in a routing

routers can use different or similar
networking protocols. Routers usually are
capable of filtering packets based on
parameters such as source addresses,
destination addresses, protocols and
network applications (ports)” (ISACA

**Rowhammer** Exploit that flips bits in memory directly
using electrical properties of high-density
memory chips: if particular areas (rows) of
RAM are repeatedly accessed (hammered)


```
by malware, physically adjacent memory
bits may be flipped due to leakage currents
in the silicon, even if those bits are in

```
Fraud in which the fraudster steals small amounts of
money through lots of separate transactions (like thin
slices of salami), each individual theft being so
insignificant as to escape the victim’s notice or concern
while accumulating a tidy sum for the fraudster. If a
discrepancy even comes to their attention, a victim will
typically assume the deficit or debit is simply a
consequence of legitimate rounding or measuring errors,
whereas it may be deliberate, unethical, illegitimate, and
perhaps illegal. “A method of computer fraud involving a

**Scalability, scaling,
elasticity**

```
Highly automated capability to alter the capacity and
performance of a system dynamically in response to, or in
expectation of, changes in demand, loading, or priorities,
typically by changing the number of allocated/assigned
resources ( e.g. cloud servers, virtual clusters, C entral
P rocessing U nits, or network paths) to maintain a
reasonably consistent performance.
```
```
Scale Reference points for the absolute or relative measurement
of parameters such as quantity, size, volume, risk,
severity, and disaster. “Ordered set of values, continuous
or discrete, or a set of categories to which the attribute is
mapped. Note: the type of scale depends on the nature of
the relationship between values on the scale. Four types of
scale are commonly defined: nominal – the measurement
values are categorical; ordinal – the measurement values
```

```
are rankings; interval – the measurement values have
equal distances corresponding to equal quantities of the
attribute; ratio – the measurement values have equal
distances corresponding to equal quantities of the
attribute, where the value of zero corresponds to none of
the attribute. These are just examples of the types of
scale” (ISO/IEC/IEEE 15939).
```
```
Scam Relatively basic/simple form of fraud committed by a
scammer that normally (but not always) causes minor
impacts on each individual victim but may lead on to
more substantial incidents. Can be significant in aggregate
since most scams are ‘a numbers game.’ See also
scareware.
```
**Scammer** Low-life fraudster who commits a scam. Whereas career
criminals and fraudsters are sometimes portrayed as
cheeky chappies and lovable rogues, scammers are the
lowest-of-the-low, marginalised and despised by
everybody _including_ their peers (since they take
‘untrustworthy’ to new depths) and even, on occasions,
themselves. Entirely selfish and mean-spirited, they have
absolutely no compunction about preying on the
vulnerable, young, elderly, sick, charitable, naïve, and
intellectually challenged, let alone fine upstanding
members of society. They would _literally_ sell their own
grandmothers if only they could find a buyer dumb
enough to fall for their spiel and trust that they would ever
deliver on a deal. When caught (for they are not, as a
breed, the most significant bits in a byte), they invariably
plead poverty and desperation as if that somehow explains
and excuses their bare-faced total disregard for the
accepted social norms and reasonable expectation of any
civilised society. Incarceration and lethal injections are
too humane for them. “Off with their goolies” we say!

Secret code Basic type of covert communications code explicitly
intended to be understood easily by the intended
recipient/s ( e.g. can often be decoded manually without
the need for computer technology) but unintelligible (not
so readily decoded) if intercepted by third parties. May be
physically concealed ( e.g. written in ‘secret ink,’ tattooed
under the hairline of a messenger), use simple substitution
( e.g. ROT13, code book), or rely on obscurity ( e.g. slang,
Navajo code-talkers, passwords). Generally weak and
vulnerable to cryptanalysis, e.g. “Attack at dawn!” might
be represented or signalled by the seemingly innocuous
mention of, say, “native daffodils” at some point in an
otherwise legitimate news broadcast, web page, press
release, blog posting, tweet, or private advertisement in
the personal columns of a national newspaper. Cf. encode,

S ingle S ign O n (SSO) Software that manages a suite of diverse passwords
unique to multiple systems. Unlike crude password
synchronisation schemes, the compromise of a password
for a single target system being managed through a well-

greater bandwidths so power companies can extend the
reach of their power control into consumer premises,
particularly industrial plants, for metering and demand
management ( e.g. shedding non-critical loads such as
household and office air conditioners if peak demands or
limited supplies threaten to overload the grid). “Electric

formatted protocol based on extensible markup language
(XML) enabling applications to communicate with each

a significant security risk to web application operations
because use of SOAP piggybacks onto a web-based
document object model and is transmitted via HyperText
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (port 80) to penetrate server
firewalls, which are usually configured to accept port 80
and port 21 File Transfer Protocol (FTP) requests. Web-
based document models define how objects on a web page
are associated with each other and how they can be
manipulated while being sent from a server to a client
browser. SOAP typically relies on XML for presentation
formatting and also adds appropriate HTTP-based headers
to send it. SOAP forms the foundation layer of the web
services stack, providing a basic messaging framework on
which more abstract layers can build. There are several
different types of messaging patterns in SOAP, but by far
the most common is the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
pattern in which one network node (the client) sends a
request message to another node (the server), and the

```
Social media applications and functions (such as those
allowing visitors to comment on news items, blogs, etc. or
review products) often invite users to identify and
authenticate themselves using their Facebook, Twitter,
Google, or LinkedIn accounts (their ‘social identities’ or
‘socials’), provided the users are willing for those social
media sites to disclose selected personal information to
the social media apps and functions. This S ingle S ign O n
approach avoids users having to register separately in
each case but raises privacy concerns.

Social insecurity Neologism refers to information security and privacy
risks, controls, and incidents directly involving human
factors and affecting people, including insecurity, social
engineering, scams, frauds, social media, social
networking, social proofing, blended attacks, phishing,
spear phishing, pretexting, coercion, spoofing, and
masquerading.
```
```
Social media Interactive websites and applications (such as Facebook,
Tumblr, LinkedIn, Twitter, Blogger, Myspace, YouTube,
blogs, and discussion forums) that facilitate social
networking and personal interaction, both benign and
malicious.
```
```
Social network Community of people, organisations, etc. with common
interests, connected by personal interactions and mutual
contacts through social media, messaging, email, etc. We
tend to drop our guards in relaxed social situations,
typically trusting people and often revealing information
and accepting things at face value, increasing our
```

```
vulnerability to social engineering. Conversely, when
needed, friends and acquaintances can provide valuable
guidance and support.
```
**Social proofing, group
affirmation, group-
think**

```
People in tight-knit social groups tend to believe in, trust,
and respect similar things. Therefore, if a friend (or
someone who has stolen a friend’s ID) recommends a link
or an application, naïve users are inclined to load it
without necessarily considering the risks of malware,
fraud, etc. Misunderstandings, misinterpretations,
misinformation, and disinformation can ‘infect’ (spread
through) a social network, particularly if members are not
adept at critical thinking.

Social protection “Preventing, managing and overcoming situations that
adversely affect people’s well-being. Note: It consists of
policies and programmes designed to reduce poverty and

Software reliability Indicator of the extent to which software can be relied
upon (trusted) to perform according to its formal
specifications, normally as demonstrated by several types
of testing and analysis. Reliability, availability, resilience,
capacity, performance, assurance, and other requirements
relate to the impacts of software/system failure, and have
significant implications for the software engineering,
architecture, and build quality. Even if the specifications
are accurate and comprehensive, reliability actually
achieved in practice, however, varies with complex
dynamic operational factors such as: the maturity and
stability of the processing platform and any required
system or network services; software configuration,
loading, usage, management, and maintenance ( e.g.
changes); competition for scarce resources; the possibility
of multiple failure modes and recovery approaches; and
the nature of threats experienced. “1. The probability that
software will not cause the failure of a system for a
specified time under specified conditions. The probability
is a function of the inputs to and use of the system in the
software. The inputs to the system determine whether
existing faults, if any, are encountered. 2. The ability of a

customer involving the exchange of information pertinent
to the products supplied. “Agreement or agreements
between acquirers and suppliers to conduct business,
deliver products or services, and realize business benefit”
(ISO/IEC 27036-1).
```
**Supply chain, supply
network, supply mesh,

```
Production and delivery of commercial products normally
involves several suppliers sequentially adding value to the
raw materials, often but not necessarily in a linear
sequence. Due to the many-to-many commercial
relationships, ‘network,’ ‘web,’ or ‘mesh’ is more
descriptive of the complexities than ‘chain.’ “Set of

successive supplier relationships established upon
placement of a purchase order, agreement, or other formal
sourcing agreement. Note 1: A supply chain can include
vendors, manufacturing facilities, logistics providers,
distribution centres, distributors, wholesalers, and other
organizations involved in the manufacturing, processing,
design and development, and handling and delivery of the
products, or service providers involved in the operation,
management, and delivery of the services. Note 2: The
supply chain view is relative to the position of the
acquirer” (ISO/IEC 27036-1). “Two-way relationship of
organizations, people, processes, logistics, information,

Surrogation Whereas metrics are usually intended to help improve
things for the benefit of all stakeholders, individuals
sometimes find ways to game the system by intentionally
manipulating or misrepresenting the metric itself to give
the appearance of improvement, rather than truly
improving the object of measurement – particularly if they
stand to benefit individually, e.g. through enhanced
reputations, bonuses, or promotions. Surrogation may also
be unintentional, where misunderstandings, biases, or
poor metrics definitions and measurement processes lead
to inappropriate decisions and changes. ‘Managing strictly
by the numbers’ can be a risky approach if the numbers
are not sufficiently representative of and correlated with
performance.

procedures for that particular transaction. Two examples
of items that may be included in a suspense file are receipt
of a payment from a source that is not readily identified or
data that do not yet have an identified match during
migration to a new application” (ISACA glossary).
```
**Suspicion, suspicious** Something that strikes an alert and security-aware person
as unusual and causes concern as a potential information
security matter, such as a stranger in a controlled area,
information assets unexpectedly going missing, or the
belief that confidential information may have been
disclosed inappropriately. While some suspicious events
may turn out to be entirely innocuous or benign, some
may be near-misses, events, or incidents worth reporting
to management or the Help Desk.

```
Sustainability Since few information risks are short-term, it is generally
necessary for the corresponding information security
controls to persist, operating effectively for considerable
periods (years or decades). Sustainable controls are self-
perpetuating, justifying their continued operation because
of the risk mitigation value they generate, provided the
stakeholders appreciate that as a result of appropriate
metrics and information about threats and incidents.

documentation, contracts with customers, and government
regulations. System requirements may result from the
entity’s commitments relating to security, availability,
processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy. For
example, a commitment to programmatically enforce

any instant by a car’s brake controller. Tag
processing can be quite sophisticated, e.g.
the extent to which the brakes operate
may depend on a combination of factors

the systems or devices concerned. Since no
control is absolutely effective, however,
‘tamper resistance’ is more accurate than
‘tamper proofing.’ See also tamper evident.

```
Actionable intelligence about actual, emerging,

information and technologies, and hence its
business. There are strategic ( e.g. novel types
of attacks and attackers), tactical ( e.g. attack
vectors), and operational ( e.g. I ndicators o f
C ompromise used to identify successful
attacks, and guidance on how to address
attacks in progress) aspects to this. Strictly
speaking, ‘vulnerability intelligence’ is a
distinct consideration although in practice it
may be treated as part of threat intel.

globally. OCEG extended the classical model
by two further levels, becoming the L ines o f
A ccountability model. See also first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth line.
```
```
Threshold Boundary condition that, when reached or
passed, triggers decisions and actions, e.g. if an
unfolding situation has become so serious as to
constitute an incident (passing a significance
threshold relating to, say, its anticipated
adverse impact on important business
activities), management may decide to initiate
the relevant incident response process. Some
thresholds are objectively determined
according to the measured values or trends in
```

```
certain parameters ( e.g. “An office temperature
of 37 Celsius”), while others are at least
partially subjective ( e.g. “Too hot to continue
working”). Either type may have defined
tolerance levels for practical reasons ( e.g. “An
office temperature of 37 ± 2 degrees Celsius”).
```
```
Throttling Rate-limiting technical security controls
designed to reduce the risk of repeated attacks
such as brute force guessing of PIN codes and
passwords or A rtificial I ntelligence model
exfiltration. Once triggered by exceeding a
defined threshold, further interactions, guesses,
queries, etc. from the user are ignored even if
they are correct. The user may or may not be
informed about this, and details of the
associated security events are generally sent to
the security logging, alarming, or alerting
subsystems.

quality, reliability, resilience, robustness,
safety, security, transparency and usability.
Trustworthiness is an attribute that can be
applied to services, products, technology, data

forbidden, prohibited, or restricted. Cf. authorised.
```
**Unauthorised access** Access that is unauthorised – either expressly
forbidden, or perhaps unspecified. “Access to
information or system components that (a) has not
been approved by a person designated to do so by
management and (b) compromises segregation of
duties, confidentiality commitments, or otherwise
increases risks to the information or system

Unaware Naïve, ignorant, blasé, and hence vulnerable,
particularly but not only to social engineering. Lack of
awareness is a factor in many incidents including
accidents, gradual, slow-acting threats such as climate
change, and attacks involving stealth, deception, and
subterfuge ( e.g. fraud). Workers who do not know
about or fail to appreciate their obligations and
expectations under various laws, policies, and rules
are obviously less likely to comply. More subtly, it
can be difficult to hold those who can legitimately
claim or feign ignorance to account for failings.

Unethical Behaviour which is not ethical and hence generally
considered inappropriate, distasteful, or undesirable if
not totally unacceptable and possibly even illegal. The
willingness to disregard social norms and constraints
on behaviour sets liars, cheats, spies, hackers,
fraudsters, criminals, and other reprobates apart from
the general population, and is itself a threat to
unaware victims. At the same time, different social
groups have their own unique ethics, codes, and sense
of what is right or wrong, e.g. hacking is deemed
acceptable (cool or revered in fact) within the hacker
community, whereas cracking is generally frowned
upon and despised (regardless of what may happen in
private).

are complex, relating to: (a) the nature of the
vulnerabilities themselves; (b) the extent, duration,

threats ( e.g. hackers and malware); (d) the potential
impacts if compromised; and (e) the presence and
effectiveness of any compensating controls ( e.g.
firewalls and other access controls, antivirus, network
and host security monitoring with alerts, alarms, and

rhetorical questions such as “Is the system usable in
its current _s_ t _a_ te? Where are the pain points? What
needs to be improved, first?” “Tests designed to

b. Subcellular parasite consisting of little
more than a protein coat and a strand of
DNA or RNA. Some viruses carry
barely enough genetic information to
encode multiple copies of themselves
that the host cell faithfully assembles

other vulnerable cells. Others (such as
COVID) encode additional proteins
that cause symptoms of infection such

Inherent/latent, potentially exploitable
weakness within an information asset,
system, process, organisation, etc. Note:
sometimes understood to include weak or
missing information security controls, a
related but distinct concern that only
constitutes a risk if the controls are relevant
and necessary; hence, their omission or
failure would expose inherent weaknesses to
threats potentially causing impacts of
concern. “Weakness or flaw in a data
processing system. Note: If a vulnerability
corresponds to a threat, a risk exists”
(ISO/IEC 2382). “ Weakness of an asset or
control that can be exploited by one or more
threats” (ISO/IEC 27000 ). “Weakness of an

assessment
```
```
Systematic analysis of vulnerabilities within
computer systems, networks, applications,
devices, processes, facilities, organisations,
etc. According to the perceived risk level
and resourcing, can range from a cursory
check for unpatched software using a
vulnerability scanner, to an in-depth security
design review, perhaps even a wide-ranging
analysis of potential weak points and gaps in
the defences for an entire supply chain,
industry, or nation. May involve self-
assessment, penetration testing, and
auditing. Daunting, maybe, but not as scary
as only discovering significant
vulnerabilities through serious incidents.
“Process of identifying and quantifying
vulnerabilities” (ISO 22300). “Can consist
of a documentation-based review of a
system’s design, an in-depth hands-on
assessment or automated scanning with
