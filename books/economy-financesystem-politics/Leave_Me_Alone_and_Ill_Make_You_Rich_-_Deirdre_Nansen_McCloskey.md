What is crucial is our ability to engage in continuous conversation,
testing one another, discovering our hidden presuppositions,  changing
our minds because we have listened to the voices of our fellows. Luna-
tics also change their minds, but their minds change with the tides of
the moon and not because they have listened, really listened, to their
fr  iends’ questions and objections.

## Preface
Th   e theme of our book is simple and true. But controversial.
It  is  that  human  liberty—  and  not  the  machinery  of  coercion
or investment, or even science by itself— is what made for a Great
Enrichment, from 1800 to the present. Th  e Enrichment was really,
really “great”: three thousand percent per person. Liberated people
devising new technologies and institutions did an amazing job from
1800  to  the  present  and  will  keep  doing  it.  Liberty  will  make  the
Enrichment worldwide. And the Enrichment will not corrupt the
human soul. Th   e news, in short, is very, very good.
Th   e  Enrichment  wasn’t  achieved  by  governmental  coercion,
which  is  usually  counterproductive—except  maybe  in  plagues
and  invasions.  Nor  was  it  achieved  by  science  unassisted,  or  the
exploitation of slaves, or the routine accumulation of capital, or a
profound dialectic of history, or a deep specialness of Europeans. It
was achieved by liberty alone, a necessary and prett  y much suffi    cient
cause, which came tentatively to northwestern Europe in the eigh-
teenth century. Give people liberty, and by un coerced cooperation
through commerce they become adults,  enriched in body and soul.
You are doubtful and pessimistic. You worry quite understand-
ably about populism or the environment or the decay of standards.
We  o ff  er, though, an optimistic prediction and give ample evidence
for it. Th   e world will prosper mightily, if people play their cards right
to favor liberty and its theory, liberalism— “liberalism” in the classic
sense, born two centuries ago.

## Preface
We   m a k e   a   l i tt  le  joke  in  the  title  of  the  book  and  throughout,
in  referring  to  “the  Bourgeois  Deal.”  Th   e   word   bourgeois (boor-
ZWAH) means “of the urban middle class, businesslike.” Imagine
our master proposition, articulated by either a bourgeois man in a
London coff  eehouse in 1820 or a bourgeois woman (Deirdre  Nansen
Mc  Closkey)  addressing  a  chapter  of  the  National  Association  of
Women Business Owners in 2020:
Leave me, a bourgeois businessperson, prett  y much alone, subject
to sober ethics learned at my mother’s knee, and a few good and
restrained laws, with an eff  ective social safety net. In a word, give
me and my fellow citizens liberty. Do not envy the rewards I get
for selling innovations. Th   ey are tested by your willingness to buy
them. If you don’t like them, and I fail, I won’t ask the govern-
ment to coerce you into buying. Th   e happy result will be that the
innovations will make everyone enormously bett  er off , by 3,000
percent, especially the formerly poor— your ancestors and mine.
You’ve heard a lot of dismal chatt  er since the Great Recession of
- As it, the most recent of the successively trademarked “Final
Crises of Capitalism,” recedes into memory, we do well to remind
ourselves that median weekly real earning of wage and salary work-
ers is sett  ing all- time highs every time the data are reported and is,
the COVID-19 dip aside, about 10 percent above where it was at the
depths of the Great Recession— and is well above its recent nadir in
the second quarter of 2014.
## 1
You might recoil at the notion that we live in a blessed age. Aft  er
all, hundreds of millions of people around the world remain in dire
poverty.  Th   e  United  States  government  is  separating  immigrant
children from their parents, holding them in cages, on the economi-
cally silly and morally obnoxious notion that by doing so they are
somehow making America great again. We aren’t saying there aren’t
serious problems. We are saying that things have gott  en  bett  er,  are
gett  ing  bett  er, and will continue to get bett  er for the vast majority of
humanity, and in a few generations for everyone on the planet— as
long as we keep our ethical wits about us and opt for true liberalism.

Th   ink it possible that the nonstop torrent of bad news fi  lling your
newspapers and e- readers and social media time lines is not giving
you the complete story. Be wary, for example, of headlines about the
exploits of “Florida Man,” a popular meme spawned by a loose pub-
lic records law in the Sunshine State. It makes it exceptionally easy to
write stories with headlines like “Florida Man Arrested for Burglar-
izing Cars in Jail Parking Lot Moments aft er Being Released” and
“Florida Man Charged with Impersonating Offi    cer  for  Mc  Donald’s
## Discount.”
## 2
Th   ere  are  roughly  10.5  million  actual  Florida  men.  If
only 0.01 percent of them are idiotic criminals, it’s still enough for
about three outrageous “Florida Man” stories every day for a year.
We admit that even in an innovation- embracing, bourgeois- dealing
society,  an  occasional  evil  nitwit  will  show  up  and  an  occasional
paragon of virtue will slip through the cracks into a life of destitution
or just plain bad luck. We are claiming, on the basis of overwhelming
evidence, that the bourgeois deal has made the cracks a lot smaller.
Long may it reign.
So we beseech you, dear reader: don’t let the much larger positive
story get lost amid the vivid and rare counterexamples, or even the
miseries of mishandled plagues. On a long view, even since 2008,
and since 1960 or 1900 or 1800, the economic world has leapt far, far
beyond the zero- sum game of olden days. You need to stop thinking
zero- sum. A liberal world is stunningly positive sum. Th   e   hands-   off
ideology  of  liberalism  has  allowed  an  invisible  hand  to  push  for-
ward any society that permits it to work— not toward capitalism  (a
silly word, as we’ll show) but toward what we call “innovism.” Th   e
evidence  is  overwhelming  that  liberty,  not  coercion  by  a  private
master or a public state, inspires people to continuous bett  erment.
For the poorest.
Th  e political side of innovism, we note, is liberalism. We use the
word,  you  see,  not  in  its  strange  US  sense,  of  “bigger  and  bigger
government.” Such a “liberalism” usually gets the economy wrong
and oft en enough slips into tyranny. Look at the misuse of the FBI
and the IRS and ICE, the Palmer raids and the fugitive slave laws.
Nor do we use the word in its even stranger Latin American sense
of “suppressing the people with military tyranny,” which likewise

xiv

## Preface
usually  gets  the  economy  wrong,  and  is  tyranny  already.  Th   ere’s
something in the water of the Western Hemisphere. We use the hon-
ored L- word in its original and international sense of “no involun-
tary masters”— no masters over slaves, no husbands over wives, no
kings or priests or politicians over citizens. On the contrary, you are
permitt  ed to say “take this job and shove it.” Or “take this marriage
and shove it.” Or “take this politician and shove him.” It turns out
that, like the free working of language or newspapers or fashion or
rock music or cookery or most other human enterprises, permitt  ing
people in the economy to have a go, free of involuntary masters to
whom they can’t say no, usually gets the economy right. Not perfect,
but prett  y darned good. Th   ree thousand percent good.
Not anarchy: we accept that some government is necessary. Well,
Mc Closkey thinks so, at any rate. Carden is more sanguine about the
viability of a sort of anarchy, understood not as nihilism but as no
rulers.
## 3
In opposition to liberalism, people will oft en say, taking an
indignant tone, “Th   ere must be some role for government!” To which
we  reply,  “Yes,  though  ‘some  role,’  such  as  safety  nets  and  plague
response, doesn’t justify grotesquely large and illiberal governments
pushing you around.” Th   at there is at least a plausible argument for
carbon  taxes  does  not  give  the  government  license  to  regulate  in
withering detail the domestic and international trade in sauerkraut.
James Madison said in Federalist 51, “If men were angels, no govern-
ment would be necessary.” Humans are not angels. Th  e trick is to
frame a government for nonangels, whether the rulers or the ruled.
It had bett er be small, because any government tends to corrupt.
Power is the ability to physically coerce people to do things they
can’t  be  persuaded  to  do  voluntarily,  such  as  paying  taxes  or  get-
ting inoculations or serving on the eastern front. Big governments
exercise more power over more people— people harmlessly chatt  ing
or strumming or knitt  ing or dealing in the economy. We believe, and
so should you, that the more involuntary masters the citizens have,
the worse they do, materially and spiritually. With too many masters
with too much power, they are reduced to children. Absolute power
corrupts absolutely.
Madison himself, like Jeff erson and Washington, was not a con-

sistent liberal. Th   ough talking a good deal about liberty, all three had
large numbers of slaves. Our own special heroes of the Revolution-
ary era are rather Adam Smith and Th  omas Paine and Mary Woll-
stonecraft  , who thoroughly rejected the ancient impulse to employ
a visible hand of masterful coercion to push people around. A new
and liberal ideology of hands- off , leave- alone, no- push, combined
with a wise generosity toward the poor and the disabled, gave the
masses permission to fl ourish. Th   ey did, spectacularly.
Th   e result contradicts an ever- fashionable itch to make up more
and more “polices” directed from above. “Let’s expropriate the rich
people,” says the left . “Let’s do more policing of the poor people,”
says the right. We say: Give permission to all the people, and give
eff  ective,  non-  demeaning  help  to  the  poor  and  disabled  among
them, and all will continue to fl ourish in body and mind. Sang the
African American poet Langston Hughes in 1936, “O, let America
be America again— / Th   e land that never has been yet— / And yet
must be— the land where every man is free.” Hallelujah.
## §
Th   at is, the Mc Closkey- Carden team is properly, honorably “liberal,”
in the old and international sense, and does not sit anywhere along
the conventional left - right spectrum. Th  e disagreements along the
spectrum are merely about whom to push around with government-
sanctioned coercion. Pick your favorite pushees, and take your place
along  the  spectrum.  Immigrants.  Workers.  Customers.  Entrepre-
neurs. Members of the United Auto Workers in Dearborn on May 26,
- Democratic protestors in Hong Kong late in 2019. Our friends
sitt  ing self- satisfi  ed on the left   or right or middle of the spectrum of
coercion mistakenly think that they can claim the honorable title of
champions of liberty/freedom. Th   ey   can’t.
Real liberals like us say that personal liberty and political liberty
and economic liberty are all of a piece. Latin liber, says the Cam-
bridge Latin Dictionary, was long understood by the slave- holding
ancients as “possessing the social and legal status of a free man (as
opp. to slave),” and then libertas as “the civil status of a free man,

## Preface
freedom.” Th   e new liberal plan born in the eighteenth century came
to mean the startling notion of a society consisting entirely, if ideally,
of free people. No slaves at all. Equality of status and permission. No
pushing around. Minimally coercive. Sweet- talking. Persuasive. Rhe-
torical. Voluntary. Humane. Tolerant. No racism. No Jim Crow. No
voter suppression. No abusing of immigrants. No imperialism. No
reign of terror over gay people. No unnecessary taxes. No imprudent
collective projects. No domination of women by men. No casting
couch. No beating of children. No messing with other people’s stuff
or persons.
Th   at  is,  liberty  is  liberty.  It’s  meaningless  by  parts.  To  put  it  in
terms of the Abrahamic religions, God wants humans to have free
will. Only then is their choice of bad or good, sin or redemption,
meaningful. To put it in secular terms, you are still a slave if only on
odd days of the month. As a free person you seek the permission,
equal to anyone else’s, to braid hair for a living, to open a factory,
to love whom you wish, to call out a tyrant in the newspaper. But
the left   or right or middle on the spectrum want to deny you one or
another permission. Shame on them.

Th   is book is a popular riff   from Carden’s pen on Mc Closkey’s Bour-
geois Era trilogy (2006, 2010, 2016)— three long, academic, heavily
footnoted,  and  (Mc  Closkey  claims)  decisively  argued  volumes,
1,700 pages in total.

It says that bourgeois life is not evil and that
approval of it led to a Great Enrichment. It says too that the usual
materialist explanations for the Enrichment are wrong. It says, on
the contrary, that changes in the ethics, rhetoric, and ideology of
northwestern Europeans, and now the world, led to liberalism, in-
novism, and enrichment.
Th   e  trilogy  relies  on  a  large  body  of  scientifi  c  and  humanistic
literature, ranging from national income accounts to Shakespeare.
Here Carden substitutes, with Mc Closkey’s more or less heavy edit-
ing, brief examples and quickie arguments— adding a bit of corny
clowning around, in which both authors idiotically delight. In an-

cient Greece a dramatist would put on a trilogy of serious plays but
then add a fourth, short, comical “satyr play.” So here.
Th   e   mott  o  at  the  outset,  by  Amélie  Oksenberg  Rorty,  is  not
clowning around or satirical. It urges us to “engage in continuous
conversation, testing one another, discovering our hidden presup-
positions, changing our minds because we have listened to the voices
of our fellows.” Th  at’s good advice in thinking about auto repair or
marital issues. So too we believe it’s good advice in thinking about
history and economics.
If in the end you’re not persuaded that the world has been very
lucky indeed to have embraced, even if only partially, the liberalism
and the innovism of the Bourgeois Deal, go in peace. Yet we hope,
dear reader, that at least you leave with some doubts ratt  ling in your
brain.



## 1
## Liberalism Liberated
In 2005 a coalition of groups organized a campaign to “Make Poverty
History.” Th   e very idea— making poverty history— startles,  consid-
ering the grind that was once the life of virtually everyone on the
planet, a few nobles and priests excepted. To be quantitative about
it, the beginning of scientifi c wisdom about economic history is to
realize  that  in  the  year  1800  worldwide,  the  miserable  average  of
production and consumption per person was about $3 day. Even in
the newly prosperous United States, Holland, and Britain, it was a
mere $6. Gak. Th   ose are the fi gures in terms of roughly present- day
prices, understand: no tricks with money involved. Try living in your
neighborhood on $3 or $6 a day. And realize by contrast that in the
United  States  it’s  now  about  $130  a  day,  and  $33  as  a  world  aver-
age, doubling in every long generation. Th  e poorest have been the
biggest benefi ciaries. Contrary to what you hear, further, since the
mid- twentieth century, inequality in the world has fallen dramati-
cally.
## 1
Th  e wretched of the earth are coming to a dignifi ed level of
income, and more. Wow.
Our task is to convey the gak and to explain the wow— and to
show that the change from gak to wow came from liberty.
Th   e view in 1651 of the English philosopher Th   omas Hobbes was
that without an all- powerful king there must have been once upon
a time a “war of all against all.” We doubt he was correct about the
king or about the once upon a time, in light of modern scholarship
in history and anthropology. But his famous vision of the poverty

of a society without some sort of discipline, whether a coercive vis-
ible hand or a voluntary invisible hand, can serve to characterize the
world that the campaign to Make Poverty History wants to escape:
In such condition [as he imagined, “the state of nature,” with no
discipline] there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof
is uncertain [think: no incentive if the fruit will anyway be sto-
len]:  and  consequently  no  culture  of  the  earth,  no  navigation
[think: no caravels of Prince Henry the Navigator exploring the
coast of Africa], nor use of commodities that may be imported by
sea [think: no pepper from the East]; no commodious building
[think: no Amsterdam city hall on the Dam]; no instruments of
moving, and removing such things as require much force [think:
no coaches on the king’s highway]; no knowledge of the face of
the earth [think: “Don’t know much about geography”]; no ac-
count of time [no clocks, no history: “Don’t know much about
the Middle Ages”]; no arts; no lett ers, no society; and which is
worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the
life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.
Double gak. Not nice. People on their own, Hobbes supposed,
are  cruel  and  selfi  sh  and  above  all  unable  to  organize  themselves
voluntarily.  To  tame  them,  they  need  a  “leviathan,”  as  he  called
it  in  the  title  of  his  1651  work—  that  is,  a  great  beast  of  a  govern-
ment. Only a top- down king, like his beloved if recently beheaded
master, Charles I of England, or Charles’s son hiding out in France,
the future Charles II, would protect peace and civilization. (His is
rather similar, we note, to the argument on the left   nowadays that a
leviathan government, much more powerful than anything Charles
I could have imagined, is necessary to protect peace and civilization
and the poor.) Th   e choice, he said, was between utt  er misery without
a masterful king or a moderated misery (even) with him.
Many people nowadays, whether on the left  or the right of poli-
tics, still credit Hobbes’s argument for top- down government. Th   ey
believe, writes the liberal economist Donald Boudreaux, “that we
human beings left   undirected by a sovereign power are either inert

blobs, capable of achieving nothing [thus say the Dems and Labour,
and old John Dewey], or unintelligent and brutal barbarians des-
tined only to rob, rape, plunder, and kill each other [thus say the
GOP and the Tories, and old Th  omas Hobbes] until and unless a
sovereign  power  restrains  us  and  directs  economic  energies  onto
more productive avenues.”
## 2
Th   e people who believe such things are
properly called statists, such as in recent politics Elizabeth Warren
on the left   of the conventional spectrum and Donald Trump on the
right. Th   e   left  or right, or middle, wants very much to coerce the
blockheads and the barbarians to get organized. Both the progres-
sives and the conservatives, in other words, view ordinary people as
children, ignorant or unruly, unable to take care of themselves, and
dangerous to others, to be tightly governed. Terrible twos.
We modern liberals don’t. We want to persuade you to join us
in liberalism in the old and honorable sense— or, if you insist on
the word, to join us in a generous version of libertarianism (a 1950s
coinage  we  would  like  to  retire).  You  don’t  really  favor  pushing
people around with a prison- industrial complex, or with regulations
preventing people from braiding hair for a living, or with collateral
damage from drone strikes, or with a separation of toddlers from
their mothers at the southern US border, do you? We bet not. As
one version of the Golden Rule puts it, do unto others as you would
have them do unto you. With an open mind and a generous heart,
dear reader, we believe you will tilt toward a humane true liberalism.
Welcome, then, to a society held together by sweet talk among free
adults, rather than by the leviathan’s coercion applied to slaves and
children.
## §
Yet in olden days the Hobbesian, statist, antiliberal case had some
plausibility—  enough  in  the  minds  of  its  advocates,  for  example,
to justify slavery as gett  ing the enslaved to do something useful, or
to hold Indonesians in Dutch apprenticeship for another century,
or to keep women properly under the control of their king- like hus-
bands. When the Irish were illiterate and the Italians superstitious

and the women confi ned, a masterful state seemed to make sense.
We don’t actually think so, but you can at least see why the masters
could point to evidence for blobbish or brutal children, whom the
masters would so wisely discipline by rod and knout.
But the case looks a lot less plausible in an age in which the Irish
and the Irish Americans have among the highest educational att  ain-
ments in the world, in which women are independent and venturing,
and in which the Italians, despite some strange voting recently, are
far  from  barbaric  and  superstitious.  In  other  words,  what  fi  ts  the
modern world is modern liberalism— as we defi ne it here, and not,
we repeat for the last time, the way it’s been defi  ned for a century in
the United States (namely, as the wide subordination of voluntary
arrangements to governmental coercion). Th   e vision in our modern
liberalism is of educated and venturing adults, able to take prett  y
good care of themselves and their families and to provision their
neighbors in voluntary exchange. We think the liberal vision is bett  er
for humans than either the old left ish vision of disorganized pro-
letarians properly led by the Communist Party or the old rightish
vision of dim- witt  ed peasants properly led by the aristocracy.
In other words, if ever there was a time to let adult and dignifi ed
people have a go, to accept the Bourgeois Deal, it’s now. To be more
precise and to paraphrase an African proverb, the best time to let
adult and dignifi ed people have a go, to accept the Bourgeois Deal,
is actually twenty or two hundred or two thousand or two hundred
thousand years ago. Th  e second best time is now. People are ready
for liberal autonomy. Permitt  ing them to have it has permitt  ed  them
to grow up. Th   e time for nudging and judging by big governments, or
overmastering by lords and husbands and experts, was yesterday, if
ever (we say, “never”). Now is the time for what is sometimes called
an obsolete- sounding “classical liberalism.” It’s not obsolete, and we
want to drop the “classical.” Th   e leviathan state, we suggest, is what’s
obsolete, whether run by former kings or present tyrants, Charles I
or Tayyip Erdoğan.
Our point, and the point of the Bourgeois Deal, is that the world
can— and  aft er 1800 emphatically did— escape the poverty, nasti-
ness, brutishness, and brevity of life as it was in 1651, without a dan-
ger of falling into a war of all against all. We make the case here that

## Liberalism Liberated

Hobbes was correct in his description of the actual and potential
miseries of 1651 but that modern times have belied his belief in the
necessity of overmastering governmental power. And the $130 a day,
or even the $33 a day, steadily rising, and its spiritual results have
belied our friends the moderate statists of the left  and of the right.
Even more so, the facts have belied our enemies the revolutionaries.
Th   e dictatorship of the proletariat or the Th   ousand Year Reich didn’t
work for human bett  erment.  Th   e Bourgeois Deal did.
## §
Until  the  1800s,  understand,  Hobbes’s  argument  seemed  wholly
natural, in societies of chiefs or kings, Genghis Khan or King Solo-
mon. Tyranny fi tt  ed reasonably well an economy of herders, and it
fi   tt  ed very well indeed a society of farmers. Th   e chiefs and kings were
happy to take personal advantage of their monopoly of coercion over
farmers unable to run away. English history up to the so- called Glori-
ous Revolution of 1688– 1689, and world history up to the American
and French Revolutions, gave litt  le room for anything but Big Daddy
or Big Brother in charge, anywhere.
It  had  always  been  so,  since  humans  stopped  being  hunter-
gatherers—  which  for  literally  millions  of  years  was  an  especially
liberated if extremely poor condition of humanity. It placed in your
genes a taste for liberty.

But people are complicated. Th   ey   imagine
at  the  same  time  that  they  dearly  want  a  king,  a  father  of  the  na-
tion. A knee- slapping passage in the Hebrew Bible recounts how the
ancient Israelites, like Argentinians today, and Italians and in truth
most every electorate in some moods, wanted more of that top- down
statism, Bonapartism, the man on the white horse. To be safe and
great. In the story, the Israelites appeal to Samuel to give them a king,
“like all the nations.” Samuel consults with God, who tells him to
warn them about gett  ing what they want. “So Samuel spoke all the
words of the Lord to the people” (1 Samuel 8:11–18):
Th   is will be the procedure of the king. . . . He will take your sons
and  place  them  for  himself  in  his  chariots  .  .  .  and  some  to  do
his plowing and to reap his harvest and to make his weapons of

and bakers. He will take the best of your fi  elds and your vineyards
and your olive groves. . . . He will take a tenth of your seed and of
your vineyards and give to his offi    cers and to his ser vants. . . . Th   en
you will cry out . . . but the Lord will not answer you in that day.
“Nevertheless, the people refused to listen.” Ha, ha.
Yet quite unexpectedly, even in the time of Hobbes, a gathering
fl ood of liberal writings began to challenge the statist assumption.
It  was  such  liberal  ideas,  we  argue,  that  made  the  modern  world,
inspiring ordinary people to be free and to venture as adults, and
not serve as plowmen and perfumers enslaved like all the nations to
kings. From the middle of the seventeenth century the list lengthens
of liberal wielders of the pen, from the Levellers in England during
the 1640s and the de la Court brothers in Holland during the 1660s.
Th   e Englishman John Locke, much infl  uenced by the Dutch during
the 1680s while hiding in Holland from King James II, gave liberal-
ism a form that would become infl uential in the American Revolu-
tion a century later. In 1733 the Frenchman Voltaire, who admired
the beginnings of liberalism and bourgeois dignity in the Britain of
his time— as against the king- worshipping snobbery of rank in his
own country— agreed with Locke in praising a free commerce. He
wrote sarcastically, “I don’t know which is the more useful to the
state, a well- powdered lord who knows precisely when the king gets
up in the morning . . . or a great merchant who enriches his country,
sends orders from his offi    ce to Surat or to Cairo, and contributes to
the well- being of the world.”

About forty years later, the confl icted
slaveholder Th   omas   Jeff erson wrote famously that all men are cre-
ated  equal  and  should  be  permitt  ed  to  pursue  happiness  in  com-
merce. In the same year of 1776, our own special hero of liberalism,
Adam Smith of Scotland (1723– 1790, who shares a birthday, you will
be pleased to know, with Carden’s daughter), penned into being an
ideology of the “obvious and simple system of natural liberty.”
## 5

published, four months before the Continental Congress approved
the fi nal draft  of the Declaration of Independence, his Inquiry  Into
the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. It said what we say:
liberty makes for prosperity and does not corrupt the soul.

## Liberalism Liberated

Th   e liberal idea of course had causes. Smith came from two- and-
a- half centuries of accidental preparation, in a northwestern Europe
formerly very far from liberal. Th   ink of Henry VIII, no liberal, ruling
England  with  a  hard  hand  from  1509  to  1547.  Contra  present-day
white nationalism and lesser lunacies, Europe was not born excep-
tional. It was, as late as 1492, a poor, nasty, brutish, and short- lived
corner  of  the  world.  Th   en,  slowly,  slowly,  the  ideology  of  leaving
people alone, the Bourgeois Deal, came there to be honored. Th   e
long Dutch revolt of 1568– 1648 against the Habsburg kings, for ex-
ample, left  the middle class, “the middling sort,” the “bourgeoisie”
(pronounced boor- zwah- ZEE),  to  step  into  the  void  in  Holland
left  by a batt le- thinned aristocracy. Th  e cities of the Lowlands had
anyway  long  come  to  be  run  by  the  upper  bourgeoisie,  the  great
merchants and guildsmen called regents. It was a tough governing of
the lower classes, who did not have political rights. But it was a litt  le
bit liberal, especially in the economy.
Th   en,  starting  late  in  the  seventeenth  century,  inspired  by  the
amazing  Dutch  economic  success,  the  idea  that  ordinary  people
might  be  left    alone  without  detailed  regulation  by  their  masters
would gradually emerge in England and Scotland and their colonial
off shoots. England fi rst and a litt le later Scotland came to esteem
what they had previously despised— that is, buying low and selling
high, by a merchant who enriches his country and contributes to the
well- being of the world. Leaving people alone economically came
slowly into favor. Th   e great economic historian Eric Jones speaks for
example of the decline of guild restrictions in England: “Th   e   joker
in the pack was the national shift   in elite opinion, which the courts
partly shared. Th  e judges oft en declined to support the restrictive-
ness  that  the  guilds  sought  to  impose.  .  .  .  A  key  case  concerned
Newbury and Ipswich in 1616 . . . to the eff ect that ‘foreigners,’ men
from outside a borough, could not be compelled to enroll”— that is,
to join the guild and be subject to its restrictions.

Th   e British, who
were once violent and illiberal worshippers of kings, slowly became,
in a phrase of the time, “a polite and commercial people.”
Indeed, declared the literary man Samuel Johnson of London in
1775, “Th  ere are few ways in which a man can be more innocently
employed than in gett ing money.” His interlocutor at the time, his

publisher William Strahan, who also lived by commerce, and was a
friend of bourgeois Benjamin Franklin, remarked, “Th  e more one
thinks  of  this,  the  juster  it  will  appear.”
## 7
Looking  at  Britain  from
France, Voltaire, who himself made a fortune in speculation with
his money earned as a playwright, had writt  en in 1733 that a British
nobleman’s  “brother  does  not  think  traffi  c is beneath him. . . . At
the time that the Earl of Orford [that is, the prime minister Robert
Walpole] governed Great Britain, his younger brother was no more
than  a  factor  [that  is,  a  merchant’s  representative]  in  Aleppo.”
## 8
## A
Swiss traveler in 1727 wrote that “in England commerce is not looked
down upon, . . . as it is in France and Germany. [In Britain aft  er  1707]
men  of  good  family  and  even  of  [aristocratic]  rank  may  become
merchants without losing caste.”
## 9
What was previously dishonorable
and contemptible— the pursuit of fi  lthy lucre— was celebrated, or at
the least not vigorously obstructed by guilds and governments. (We
worry, and so should you: Is an illiberal and medieval obstruction-
ism by regulation being reimposed?)
Th   e result of the new liberal idea was that aft er 1800 or so, a tsu-
nami of bett  erment rolled over the West and eventually over much
of the rest. Th   e   bett  erment is properly called the Great Enrichment.
Railways.  Mass  schooling.  Skyscrapers.  Electricity.  Sewage  treat-
ment. Universities. Antibiotics. Containerization. Computers. In the
places that have experienced it fully, the average Jack or Jill, whose
great- great- grandparents were starkly impoverished, lives a life that
is  connected,  wealthy,  far  from  nasty,  peaceful,  and  by  historical
standards amazingly long. Not Hobbesian. Wow.

It’s the End of the World

Relatively  speaking,  at  any  rate.  Lord  knows  there  is  still  plenty
wrong among the nations, and nothing we say is meant to imply that
the job is fi nished or that there is no more to do for the remaining
poor and tyrannized. By some counts, for example, there are still
some forty million bought- and- sold slaves. Out of the seven and a
half billion souls nowadays, the economist Paul Collier properly la-
ments a “Bott  om Billion,” who still live the Hobbesian nightmare—
though it should be noted that the Bott  om Billion are typically ruled
by a leviathan of a government, or an incompetent and corrupt one,
sometimes all that and more.

North Korea. Chad. But Collier agrees
with  all  informed  observers  that  the  one  billion  is  an  astonishing
improvement over the situation as recently as 1960, when about 1.5
of the total then of three billion people on the planet lived lives that
were  poor,  nasty,  brutish,  and  short.  Th   ey  dragged  along  on  that
three dollars a day, or less.
Our present lives almost anywhere, in still very poor places, are of
course not at all, in Hobbesian terms, anything like “solitary.” More
than half of the world’s population now lives in what the person’s
nation  reckons  is  an  “urban”  area,  usually  a  very  big  one,  a  share
rapidly growing. Fully 90 million Chinese farmers, for example, one
fourteenth of the entire population of China, moved to big cities
in the seven years from 2012 to 2019. About half of such urbanites
worldwide have internet access.

bicycle, the tram, the telephone, the subway, the auto, the radio, the
TV, the airplane, capped by the internet— have since 1800 fashioned
a global village, the breaking down of local monopolies, and the end
of solitude in a cave or desert, or the nasty nonsolitude of a tradi-
tional village.
So not at least “solitary.” But especially you need to grasp that the
world is no longer uniformly “poor.” Th   at’s the crux, a miracle since
1800, or even since 1960, of enormously increasing world real income
per person “in the face of,” as it is conventionally put, a world popula-
tion seven times larger since 1800 and 150 percent more since 1960.
Th  e conventional phrase “in the face of,” though, supposes that
population growth causes lower per person income. It doesn’t, not
in the modern world. Th   e phrase evokes an old commonplace in a
zero- sum world, of too many new mouths outnumbering the hands
and backs to grow the food. Th   omas Malthus wrote so in 1798. On
the contrary, economic science now, and anyway the raw experience
of the past couple of centuries, says emphatically that having more
people born is good, not bad. Not for Keynesian reasons of demand,
but for neoclassical reasons of supply. (It applies to immigration, too.
Listen up, you nativists and white nationalists.) More people now
mean more opportunities to trade and to innovate, inside a “village”
of almost 8 billion souls.
Our ancestors, we said, lived on about $3 a day, expressed in US
dollars at 2008 prices. Th   e poorest places were down at $1 a day, the
richest as an average in 1800, up at a still pathetic $6. Now the two
billion or so people in the very high- income nations earn more like
$80 to $150 a day. Th  ey are on the sharply rising blade of a hockey
stick of the Great Enrichment, aft er three hundred thousand years
bumping  along  the  $3  a  day  of  the  handle.  Th   e  enriching  people
live in liberal economies in which you can venture on bett  erments
for all, and profi t from them— Toyota as against the impoverished
Japanese of a century ago; Volvo as against the impoverished Swedes
of a century and a half ago.
Th   e great magnitude of the increase is not at all in scientifi  c doubt,
ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 percent over the pathetic base, depend-

ing on where one measures it or with what technical adjustments
for  quality  improvement.  Th   e  Nobel  laureate  in  economics  Wil-
liam Nordhaus notes that the conventional magnitudes are greatly
under stated precisely because the quality of goods and services has
improved: “If we are to obtain accurate estimates of the growth of
real incomes over the last century, we must somehow construct price
indexes that account for the vast changes in the quality and range of
goods and services that we consume, that somehow compare the
services of horse with automobile, of Pony Express with facsimile
machine [facsimile machine— how quaint!], of carbon paper with
photocopier, of dark and lonely nights with nights spent watching
television,  and  of  brain  surgery  with  magnetic  resonance  imag-
ing.”
## 3
Th  e world’s daily bread, along with clothing and shelter and
entertainment and lighting and dentistry and air conditioning, has
increased by a factor of easily ten globally, and much more, thirty to
one hundred times, in the high- income nations. Such high income
was once a club that Europeans imagined to be exclusively their own.
Now places like China and India are knocking at the door. Th   e   aver-
age, including in the fi gure even some still wretchedly poor nations
like Haiti or Mali, is equal to the average in Brazil, now about $33 a
day, which was the US level in 1940. It is well below the present US
level of $130 a day, but even $33 is a miraculous leap from $3 or $6.
Never before.
Bring it into the terms of your own insanely rich life. Consider
the last time you went to your local gourmet coff ee shop. You can
think  of  the  0.75  fl  uid  ounce  shot  of  espresso  as  the  wherewithal
for  premodern  daily  consumption—  and  aft  er  all,  the  shot  does
cost  about  $3.  It’s  probably  not  even  espresso  but  rather  watery,
scorched, church- foyer coff ee. But the change since 1800 is not an
increase from a 0.75- ounce shot to, say, 1.5 ounces, which was the
sort  of  magnitude  seen  in  previous  eras  of  temporary  prosperity.
Oh, no. It’s an increase in the worldwide average to a heart- stopping
8- ounce cup. And the increase has been much, much larger in coun-
tries like the United States and Japan and Norway that have gone up
to a full 31 ounces of premium coff ee, blended with ice and topped

with whipped cream and caramel for good measure. Th   e increase is
insanely good by historical standards. And it does not leave the poor
behind. It does not come at their expense. It is amazing.
Nor  is  a  modern  and  rich  country  Hobbesian  “nasty,”  any  way
you want to think about it. If ethically, the political scientist John
Mueller has pointed out that the popularity of war as an extension
of politics has been declining for two centuries.
## 4
Liberals don’t like
starting wars. If physically “nasty,” look at the pipes that bring you
clean water to wash your clothes and dishes and body, and consider
the  indoor  plumbing  and  refuse  collection  that  whisk  away  the
waste. (We are not forgett  ing where the waste goes, but that, too, is
improving compared with 1800, when people were dumping sewage
and garbage into the canal in front of the house, even in relatively
rich Amsterdam.) Advances in cleanliness and hygiene have become
routine, teeth regularly brushed and bodies washed and abundant
clothing changed. Moderns have hot water on command and closets
full of clothing, once reserved for dukes and duchesses, and doubt-
fully even for them. Perfume usually did the job. Th  e Hall of Mir-
rors at Versailles, where the elite att  ended in 1700 on the Sun King,
had no toilets: the dukes and duchesses relieved themselves in the
staircases.
Hobbesian “brutish”? Not remotely, by historical standards. For all
the anxiety about crime rates and terrorism now, an anxiety stoked by
populists of the right, you are less likely than your ancestors to die at
the hands of another person— or for that matt  er, to be mauled by an
animal. As for the terrorists, John Mueller also found that the threat
of modern terrorism is grossly overblown.
## 5
Outside the Middle East,
in which nonstate violence in aid of political ends has indeed sharply
increased, terrorism has fallen to a tiny percentage of its level during
the 1960s and 1970s. You older readers can remember, among other
terroristic horrors from Colombia to Kashmir, the weekly bombings
in the United States in opposition to the Vietnam War and in favor
of radical economic change— radicals tried and failed to bomb the
economics department at UCLA in 1968 but succeeded in a build-
ing at the University of Wisconsin— or the bombings in the United
Kingdom by the Irish Republican Army. Europe in the 1960s and

1970s saw bombings in Spain by Basque separatists, kidnappings for
ransom out of their autos of politicians and businesspeople in Italy
by the Brigate Rosse and in West Germany by the Baader- Meinhof
Gang. Th   e joke in Germany at the time was that BMW autos, high-
end and therefore oft en driven by wealthy businesspeople able to
pay large ransoms, amounted to Baader- Meinhof  Wagen. Th   e   chance
in the United States of dying at the hands of terrorists, domestic or
international, Mueller notes, is close to zero.
As for the animals, until the nineteenth century in Europe, the
nature outside the village or town was viewed as a terrifying enemy,
not as a romantic prospect or a glorious national park for Bambi the
Fawn and Smokey the Bear. In the early nineteenth century, packs
of wolves roamed parts of the urbanized Netherlands, and still more
recently they were a scourge in eastern Europe. Th   e historian Steven
Pyne observes that, until late in the nineteenth century, the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado was viewed as a nasty obstacle to travel, a
terrifying entrance to hell.

Modernity has
given us plenty of imagined and real violence in video games and
movies  and  football,  rather  like  ancient  Greek  drama  or  Chinese
opera or Roman gladiatorial games. But nowadays they are mostly
substitutes for the real and major violence. You and your children are
more likely to die of diseases of the very old, in a bed surrounded by
loved ones, than in a quarrel in a bar with men routinely armed with
daggers and swords, as the playwright Christopher Marlowe did in
1593, or in a batt le death, as did a startlingly high percentage of the
men of the medieval English nobility.
Nor has life remained, as Hobbes put it, “short.” Life expectancy
at birth at the height of the Roman Empire was twenty- four years.
Th  e Roman cemeteries are crowded with the remains of children.
By 1800, it was lower than forty in England and France and other
western European countries, and oft en lower elsewhere. Today it
is around eighty in wealthy countries and around sixty even in the
poorest. Th  e average is more than seventy years globally, and ris-
ing smartly. A baby born in Nigeria today can expect half again as

many days as could a baby born in the richest countries in the world
in  1800.  As  the  economist  and  Nobel  laureate  Angus  Deaton  put
it  in  2016,  “Today,  children  in  sub-  Saharan  Africa  are  more  likely
to survive to age 5 than were English children born in 1918.”

was in England a mere century ago— then as now near the top of
the world’s income tables. And the Nigerian child’s life- years will
be radically healthier, her literacy higher, her prospects greater than
they were for her parents. In the fi  rst decade of the twenty- fi  rst cen-
tury, sub- Saharan Africa started to share in world growth, at rates
doubling real GDP per person in a single long generation. Ethiopia
is booming.
And more. Go to OurWorldInData .org and turn over the att  ested
facts of income, health, education, human rights, and a host of other
measures of well- being. It’s not 1960 anymore, class, not to speak of
1800, as the great Hans Rosling (1948– 2017), a Swedish professor of
public health, urged us to realize. He argued that the simplest single
measure of welfare is infant mortality, because it refl ects the over-
burdened lives of poor adult caretakers as much as the poisonous
quality of water available to their babies.

Infant and child mortality

Nostalgia and Pessimism
## Worsen Poverty
So the world has been enriched. But for whom? Cui bono? asked the
Romans: “Whose benefi t?”
Answer: Yours, and more and more of your fellow humans, with
a believable promise that the whole world will presently become
rich and free.
Consider Les Misérables. One of the novel’s and the musical’s main
characters is Fantine, a single mother in Paris in 1832 living a hard life.
In the summer of 2014, the Red Mountain Th   eatre Company in Bir-
mingham, Alabama, staged the show. An advertisement in the pro-
gram for the Women’s Fund exhorted the audience to “Help Women
Like Fantine in Birmingham” and noted, “Th   e median income for a
single mother with two children is [“only” implied] $29,390.”
We admire the Women’s Fund for tying its mission to one of Les
Misérables’ central themes. As Victor Hugo wrote to one his publish-
ers, “Wherever men go in ignorance or despair, wherever women sell
themselves for bread, wherever children lack a book to learn from
or a warm hearth, Les Misérables knocks at the door and says: ‘Open
up, I am here for you.’”
## 1
Yet we wonder, in our economists’ cold man-
ner: Is the median single mother of two children in Birmingham,
Alabama, really “like Fantine”?
Since  the  mid-  twentieth  century,  economic  historians  have
gathered the evidence to give a decisive answer: No, she is not. Not
even close. Around 1832, the annual per capita income of France (in
2014 US dollars) was as low as $1,750 or as high as $2,270, depending

## 18

chapter  3
on which technical adjustments one makes.
## 2
For each person in a
family, that’s $4.79 to $6.22 per day. As members of the Misérables,
Fantine and her daughter Cosett  e would have earned much less than
the French average. Compare such an 1832 income per person to the
median three- person, single- mother- headed household in Birming-
ham in 2014. It would be the $29,390 the Women’s Fund mentioned
divided by three people and then divided by 365, a daily income of
$26.84. It is between four and fi ve- and- a- half times higher than the
French average of 1832, or more like eight to ten times higher than
impoverished Fantine. In short, a single mother in Birmingham in
2014 led a vastly more comfortable life, materially speaking, than
did someone like Fantine in Paris in 1832. Running water. Health
care that works. Literacy. Enough to eat. An apartment instead of a
miserable shared room. It isn’t heaven, Lord knows, but it wasn’t the
hell of the poor in France in 1832.
And the diff erence is underestimated, considering the diffi  culty
of  adjusting  fully  for  improvements  in  the  quality  of  the  goods
and services available now. Th  ink of medicine in 1832, still bleed-
ing people— a litt  le earlier, a bleeding administered by doctors had
killed George Washington. Or think of transport, by foot or a rich
man’s horse (“If wishes were horses, beggars would ride”). In olden
days the heating, education, glass in buildings, and hygiene such as
sewers were pathetic by the standards of the nonrich in Birmingham
in 2014.
Th   e $26.84 per person per day is prett  y close to the present global
average we mentioned of $33. Compared with the rest of the world,
the single mother in Birmingham with two children in 2014 had a
solidly middling income— a real income around what the US aver-
age,  we  have  noted,  was  during  the  1930s  and  1940s.  Not  heaven,
again, but not hell, either. (Mc Closkey as a small child was there;
prett  y good, it seemed— penny candy at the corner store.)
Fantine would choose Birmingham every time. She would be bet-
ter off   in goods and services, with a prospect for improvement. Th   is
is not to say that no one even in rich countries such as the United
States is unskilled, addicted, badly parented, discriminated against,
or  simply  horribly  unlucky.  Th   ink  back  to  Florida  Man.  George

Packer’s Th   e Unwinding : An Inner History of the New America (2013)
and Barbara Ehrenreich’s earlier Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Gett  ing
By  in  America  (2001)  carry  on  a  long  and  distinguished  tradition
of telling the bourgeoisie about the poor— one extending back to
James Agee and Walker Evans, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941),
George Orwell, Th  e Road to Wigan Pier (1937), Jack London, Th   e
People of the Abyss (1903), Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives: Stud-
ies among the Tenements of New York (1890), and the fount, Friedrich
Engels, Th   e Condition of the Working Class in England (1845).
Th   ey  are  not  making  it  up.  Anyone  who  reads  such  books  is
wrenched  out  of  a  comfortable  ignorance  about  the  “other  half.”
In fi ctional form one is similarly wrenched by John Steinbeck’s Th   e
Grapes  of  Wrath  (1939)  or  Richard  Wright’s  Native  Son  (1940)  or
James T. Farrell’s Studs Lonigan trilogy (1932– 1935) or, from earlier
in Europe, Émile Zola’s Germinal (1885) or indeed Hugo’s Les Misé-
rables (1862). Such books helped form the minds of many socialists
(including Mc Closkey at age sixteen). Th   e wrenching is salutary. It
is said that Winston Churchill, scion of the aristocracy, believed that
most British poor people lived in rose- covered cott  ages.  He  couldn’t
imagine back- to- backs in Salford, with the outhouse at the end of the
row. Wake up, Winston.
But waking up does not imply despairing nor introducing poli-
cies that do not in fact help the poor— or proposing the overthrow
of “the system,” if the system is in fact enriching the poor over the
long run, or at any rate is enriching the poor bett  er than those other
systems that have been tried from time to time. Th   e children of the
sharecropping families in Hale County, Alabama, whom Agee and
Evans objectifi ed, to the lasting resentment of the older members,
are doing prett  y well, holding decent jobs; many of their own chil-
dren are going to college.

trary to the newspaper stories and the pessimistic books. Massive

mean that medicine should be replaced by witch doctors, so long
as death rates are falling. Economically speaking, in the tyrannies
of Mao Zedong’s China or Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela, and even in
Bernie Sanders’s imagined sweet democratic socialism, the witch
doctors are put in charge. Magically, they promise, the poor will be
bett  er  off  . Simple. Cast a spell.
Uh- oh. One wishes that TV producers and newspaper editors

A Fantine whisked off   to modern Birmingham could get the picture
by going down to the local library and checking out any number of
books documenting long- run economic, political, social, and cul-
tural bett  erment— the Rosling family’s brilliant summarizing book
Factfulness, for example, which we draw on heavily here.

(Highly
recommended. Wake up.)
People have, Hans Rosling and his coauthors note, more political
liberty now. In 1816, with Fantine’s world emerging from a genera-
tion of French wars, 1 percent of the world’s population lived under
democratic institutions. In 2015, 56 percent did. In 1800, slavery was
legal in 193 out of 194 countries (the UK was the exception). It had
fallen to 3 by 2017. In 1893, only one country out of the 194 consid-
ered by Rosling (New Zealand) allowed women to vote. It had risen
to 193 by 2017.

“But that’s the last two hundred years,” you protest. “Th   ings   have
deteriorated recently.” Oh, heavens no, dear (says Mc Closkey), they
have not. You’re quite mistaken. You may be cherishing your (as you
imagine) sophisticated and good- hearted pessimism more than a
scientifi  c  factfulness  from  the  Realistic  Rosling  or  historicoeco-
nomic truths from the Mindful Mc Closkey and the Candid Carden.
Mc Closkey was born on September 11, 1942, at the height of the

Nostalgia and Pessimism Worsen Poverty

## 21
Batt  le of Stalingrad. During that fateful year, 201 people out of every
100,000 on the planet died in batt  le, unsurprisingly considering that
it was the turning point of World War II. In 2016, the Rosling team
reports, only one person out of every 100,000 died in batt  le.  What’s
mildly surprising is that you hear more about the thousands of them
than about the tens of millions in World War II, and therefore you
get the impression that war is more prevalent now. It’s not.
Th   e fraction of people living in extreme poverty around the world
was very high in 1942, and it was still 50 percent in 1966, when Mc-
Closkey was a graduate student in economics, as the sixties began to
swing. It was 29 percent as late as 1997, when Carden graduated from
high school and Princess Diana died. By 2017, it was 9 percent. In
1997, 42 percent of the population of India and China, home to four
out of every ten humans, lived in extreme poverty. By 2017 those per-
centages had fallen to 12 percent in India and 0.7 percent in China.
In Latin America, the proportion fell from 14 percent to 4 percent.
Access to health care has changed, too. In 1980, when John Lennon
was  murdered,  Carden  turned  one  year  old  and  was  among  the
merely 22 percent of one- year- olds worldwide who got at least one
vaccination. Th   e percentage by 2016 had quadrupled, to 88 percent.
We suggest therefore, following the Roslings, that you set aside a
hazy nostalgia for the good old days, such as the famous 1950s and
1960s during which Mc Closkey grew up. (Oh, Elvis!) Put the actual
facts into the chronology of your own life. In 1950, when the Korean
War began, 28 percent of the world’s children between the ages of
fi  ve  and  fourteen  worked  full  time.  By  2012,  when  Carden’s  third
child was born, that fi  gure had fallen to 10 percent. In 1970, near the
beginning of Mc Closkey’s dozen years teaching economics and then
also history at the University of Chicago, 28 percent of the people in
the world were undernourished. By 2015, the year Carden got tenure
at Samford University in Birmingham, 11 percent were. And on and
on, year by year— with no recent slowing, not at all. Rather, there has
been recently a rapid approach to a worldwide Great Enrichment.
Th   ink about the rights of women and racial and ethnic minorities
and LGBTQ folk. Th   ink it possible you see the past like the character
Wee Bear in a couple of 2005 panels from the comic strip “Pearls

## 6
Wee Bear implores the then- seventy- four- year- old
pioneer of African Americans in major- league baseball Willie Mays,
as “an icon of a past era that somehow seems bett er than today,” to
“go back to centerfi eld and everything will be okay.” Mays declines.
Wee Bear persists, exclaiming, “I’m drowning in a sea of Sean Hanni-
tys and James Carvilles and Ann Coulters and Al Frankens. . . . I want
to return to 1957 when this was one nation!” Uh- huh. Mays replies,
“When I couldn’t eat in certain restaurants?” Th   ink it possible that
1957  (Sputnik;  troops  in  Litt  le  Rock)  was  a  bad  year  for  most  of
humanity. Radically less so now.
Yes,  we  understand.  You  view  pessimism  as  more  honorable
than optimism. Pessimism says that you really, really care about the
world’s poor and les misérables, and really, really want to do more,
or at least coerce other people to do more. And it says, too, that you
are cool and sophisticated, unlike the cockeyed optimists Rosling,
Carden,  Mc  Closkey,  and  numerous  other  demographic  and  eco-
nomic scientists. A realist. “So much more remains to be done,” the
politician  declares.  Done  by  giving  the  politician  more  power  to
coerce. “Th   e world has appalling problems remaining,” declares the
self- appointed planner of your life. Historical facts and economic
principles  be  damned.  “Bett  er  the  precautionary  principle,”  de-
clares the enthusiastic environmentalist. Th   e time is late. Humanity
is doomed.
Pessimism sells. For reasons we have never understood, people
love to hear that the world is going to hell. Th   ey become huff  y and
scornful when some idiotic optimist intrudes on their pleasure. A
cartoon in the New Yorker shows a couple who have just passed a
bearded man in a prophet’s robes holding up a sign saying, “Th   e   End
Is Near.” One of them remarks, “Say, wasn’t that Paul Krugman?”
## 7
But the evidence is that pessimism has been for a long time deeply
mistaken. Th   e evidence lies all around, we have noted, in sober and
in silly sources. Th   e economists Steven Horwitz and Stewart Dompe
exploit evidence from the long- running TV show Th   e   Simpsons. In
the fi rst season of the show, which debuted in December 1989, at
the conclusion of the regular opening sequence, you see the family
plopped down in front of an old vacuum- tube TV set topped with a

Th  e world is bett ering. Let’s keep doing it, and not let ourselves
be charmed by an unscientifi c pessimism.

Under Liberalism the
## Formerly Poor Can
## Flourish Ethically
and Spiritually
Th   e world since 1800 has grown richer spiritually, too— in contradic-
tion to fears from both the left  and the right that people have ex-
changed a material for a spiritual poverty. On the contrary, a spiritual
great enrichment has accompanied the material. A young American,
Timothy Walker of Cincinnati, was host in 1831 to the French aristo-
crat Alexis de Tocqueville during his American tour. Walker, excus-
ing his country’s primitive high culture at the time, declared, “Our
doctrine is that men must be released from the bondage of perpetual
bodily toil before they can make great spiritual att  ainments.”
## 1
And so
the Americans at length did, compliments of their bourgeois such as
Walker. God and Mammon have coexisted for two centuries.
Trade per se is not vulgar, dirty, dishonorable, mean, or selfi sh.
On the contrary, it can easily be honorable, spiritually ennobling,
altruistic, and possibility- expanding— when governed, as it regularly
is, by a balanced system of the virtues of faith, hope, love, courage,
justice, temperance, and prudence. Jeff  rey Tucker’s brilliant and hu-
mane book of 2019, Th  e Market Loves You: Why You Should Love It
Back, notes that trade among people is an occasion for love. Yes, love.
“It’s not personal love,” he writes, not always, though you person-
ally in fact come to love (or sometimes hate) your offi    ce  mates  and
the server who pours your coff  ee at the local eatery every morning.
Tucker  quotes  C.  S.  Lewis  (he  of  Th   e  Chronicles  of  Narnia),  not-
ing that ordinary life depends, aft er all, on aff ection, ancient Greek
storgê: “Aff  ection is responsible for nine- tenths of whatever solid and

## 25
durable happiness there is in our natural lives.” Tucker comments
on Lewis’s remark that aff  ection in markets is “like structural love, a
system- wide devotion to benefaction [Latin for ‘good- doing’] based
on giving and gett  ing. . . . We need each other. We trust each other.
We are lovers” in the market as much as by other paths in the home
or offi    ce or on the playground.
## 2
Oh no, said the philosopher Michael Sandel in a 2012 book en-
titled What Money Can’t Buy: Th  e Moral Limits of Markets.
## 3
We l l ,
of course money shouldn’t buy everything, such as much of storgê,
though in a market. Sandel gives numerous examples of the moral
dilemmas in choosing money prices rather than time spent standing
in line or racial status or Communist Party membership to allocate
things, from selling kidneys to buying baseball players. Surely many
things are sold that shouldn’t be, such as college term papers or, as
we have come to know, college places for phony athletes. We agree
with Sandel that the study of markets should be remoralized, in just
the way Jeff  rey Tucker does. People should know why they believe,
morally speaking, that bread should be allocated by a market but
children should not. It’s not enough to simply sneer from the left
or right or middle. Economists, too, need to do the philosophical
work. “Markets are not mere mechanisms,” Sandel wisely observes.
“Th   ey embody certain norms.”
## 4
He later adds, “Market reasoning is
incomplete without moral reasoning.”
## 5
Ye s .
Yet, surprisingly, his moral thoughts are two only, and thin ver-
sions even of these: that a state- enforced equality of outcome, be-
yond a liberal equality of permission, is good; and that the sacred can
be corrupted by the profane. Sandel states, “Th   e fairness objection
[to what money should buy] asks about the equality [of outcome]
that market choices may refl  ect; the corruption objection asks about
the att itude and norms that market relations may damage.”
## 6
Th   at,
philosophically speaking, is it. Never mind, it seems, the inequality
of time to queue or racial status or Communist Party membership
that in the absence of supply- and- demand prices comes to deter-
mine who gets what; never mind, it seems, the norms that nonmarket
relations such as nepotism or political dogma or gender prejudice
may damage.

## 26
## *
chapter  4
Sandel is a prominent representative of antimarket thinkers who
have not paused to do much thinking about what they condemn.
His analysis of equality as a moral principle, his “fairness objection,”
does not get beyond the schoolyard taunt that such- and- such is “not
fair.” Yet if charging tolls on congested highways is “unfair to com-
muters of modest means” (in Sandel’s repeated formulation of the
fi rst principle), what is to stop society from concluding that charg-
ing for bread and housing and clothing and cable TV and Fritos is
## “unfair”?
## 7
Nothing. Th   e society ends in full- blown statism, a modern
leviathan. Th   e unanalyzed dictum that it’s “unfair” that Carden does
not have his own 5,000- square- foot supersuite at the Bellagio in Las
Vegas (he really does fi  nd it troubling) would slip down to allocation
by state direction by the Communist or Nazi Party for everything.
## Byelorussia.
One can devise moral principles to stop the slip down the road to
serfdom. But Sandel does not off  er any, like the majority of our good
friends the communitarian and regulatory and soft  -  socialist  critics
of markets. In accord with a thoughtless dogma of fairness, Sandel
leaves his college class to conclude that unadorned “unfairness” is a
moral taunt suitable to discussion among grownups.
His second principle, and a bett  er argument for what money can’t
buy, and the deep source of anger at an enriched modernity, is that
buying with money can sometimes cause the sacred to be spoiled
by the profane. Sandel does not actually use the theological words.
He would have benefi tt ed from studying theology and would have
gott  en further in his moral philosophy. But, yes, “we corrupt a good,
an activity, or a social practice whenever we treat it according to a
lower norm than is appropriate to it.”
## 8
Got it.
Meanwhile, though, his theory remains again at the playground
level of an unanalyzed contrast between the two, high versus low.
Sandel  is  persuasive,  admitt  edly,  when  he  goes  aft  er  the  equally
shallow  moral  theories  of  Prudence  Only  by  many  of  our  fellow
economists.  Sandel  is  correct  that  what  is  called  “agency  theory,”
which since 1980 has taken over American graduate schools of  busi-
ness, is ethically crazy. It declares that all that humans require are

Under Liberalism the Formerly Poor Can Flourish Ethically and Spiritually
## *
## 27
incentives, like trained seals. No. Humans require also Lewisian/
Tuckerian storgê, aff ection, and professionalism and judgment and
history and norms, as bankers have recently learned.
Yet Sandel off ers no philosophical standard for the sacred ver-
sus the profane, no guide to his students or the bankers. One can
agree that buying grades or honorary degrees or a friend’s advice or
a husband’s sexual services are viewed nowadays as immoral. But
why exactly? Once upon a time all such things were for sale— and
today still are in some societies and circles. Note again the college
admission scandal, by which rich parents can buy their child’s ad-
mission  to  Harvard  by  buying  the  fencing  coach’s  house  at  twice
what it is worth. It has long been true in Russia. In the European
Middle  Ages  one  could  buy  almost  anything—  wheat  and  iron,
yes, but also husbands, marketplaces, kingdoms, eternal salvation.
Sandel  claims  repeatedly  that  “market  triumphalism”  is  new.  It’s
bad history, although it’s what most people believe: that in olden
days the people were pure and fair but now they are “capitalist” and
corrupt. But the actual golden age of allocation by alleged fairness
and actual disgust and corrupt politics was not those far olden days
but rather 1933– 1965, the height of statist experiments. Before 1933
a market logic prett  y much ruled, in China and India as much as in
England and Italy.
Sandel worries properly that the market can crowd out the sacred.
A corporate fi nancing of, say, elementary classrooms might crowd
out self- critical teaching about innovism. Yet Sandel does not in-
form his college students that fi nancing by the state might crowd
out self- critical teaching about the bad results of, say, the unthinking
patriotism taught to Mc Closkey as a child in the 1950s or the un-
thinking obedience to the nanny state taught to Carden in the 1980s,
or the unthinking environmentalism taught to Steven Landsburg’s
daughter in the 1990s that he eviscerated in the last chapter of his
fi ne book Th  e Armchair Economist.
## 9
And what about crowding in? A
society allocating goods by race or gender or party membership is
not obviously superior in moral terms compared with one like Swe-
den in which market prices rule. Sandel declares that “we must also

## 28
## *
chapter  4
ask whether market norms will crowd out non- market norms.”
## 10
## But
he provides no philosophical analysis or historical evidence about
how you would answer the opposite crowding, as when nonmarket
norms of Jim Crow in the brief Sandelian golden age before 1965
crowded out the market norm that Willie Mays’s money is as good at
a lunch counter as a white person’s. A market society is by no means
contemptible ethically, if one looks into the actual ethical eff  ects  and
thinks about them. Th  e French spoke in the eighteenth century of
“sweet commerce,” the civilizing eff ect of markets introduced into
societies of status or solitude. Th   at’s   right.
We agree with Sandel that there are things that are for sale that
shouldn’t  be,  such  as  slaves  and  college  term  papers.  But  we  also
agree with Sandel’s critics Jason Brennan and Peter M. Jaworski— of
Markets Without Limits: Moral Virtues and Commercial Interests—
that  it  isn’t  the  introduction  of  exchange  that  makes  these  things
wrong. Slavery is wrong even if you are giving away the slaves. Pla-
giarism is wrong even if you get a ghostwritt  en essay as a gift  . It isn’t,
Brennan and Jaworski argue, the introduction of market exchange
that turns something worthy into something wicked. We think their
principle— “If you may do it for free, you may do it for money”— is
much more defensible.
## 11
Brennan and Jaworski off er an answer to Sandel. Sandel recoils
at the idea that people can pay to have their wedding toasts writ-
ten, but Brennan and Jaworski ask us to imagine a Twin Earth with
a Twin America in which a Twin Michael Sandel teaches at Twin
Harvard and has writt  en a book titled What Money Can’t Buy. Th   ere’s
a twist, though: in Twin America, it is customary for people to pay
extravagantly for wedding toasts writt  en by fi  rst- rate wordsmiths and
customary for the members of the wedding party to bake the cake.
Th  ere is, in Twin America, a growing business in making wedding
cakes, and Twin Michael Sandel includes the burgeoning market in
wedding cakes as an example of how market logic is corrupting the
sacred. And yet Real Michael Sandel lets the actually existing market
for wedding cakes, wedding planners, catering, and event spaces pass
without comment.
## 12
Th   ere are thriving markets in a great many evil

and corrupting things. But it isn’t that they are traded in markets
that makes them evil.
## §
Th   ink:  Fantine  of  1832,  if  she  could  pass  over  magically  to  2014
Birmingham,  would  have  more  than  bread.  Frenzied  bett  erment
brought about by the Bourgeois Deal multiplied the voices in the
artistic and spiritual conversation as much as the food- and- shelter
conversation and amplifi ed them. Indeed, the argument for com-
mercially tested bett erment in profane markets is the same as the
argument for choice- tested bett erment in sacred arts and worship.
Th   e Mississippi Delta is said to begin in the lobby of Memphis, Ten-
nessee’s Peabody Hotel. On December 15, 1977, Congress offi    cially
recognized nearby Beale Street in Memphis, now a booze- soaked
tourist att  raction, as the “Home of the Blues.” Playing the blues and
succeeding on Beale Street required an entrepreneurial spirit and a
creative mind— and the permissions of the Bourgeois Deal.
It also required the modern abundance of musical instruments.
As the musician and writer Chris Kjorness has shown, for many of
Memphis’s musical pioneers in 1908, the instrument was the electric
guitar from the Sears, Roebuck & Co. catalog for $1.89 (about $53
in  today’s  prices;  two  hours’  work  now,  three  days’  work  then).
## 13

Cheap electric guitars were labor- saving instruments for a creatively
destroying innovism. With instructional manuals from Sears, too,
black musicians like B. B. King and white musicians like Roy Clark
learned their craft .
Sears was not a charity. Commercial innovism literally brought
new, previously silenced voices into the musical conversation. By
leaving Sears alone to innovate in distribution (compare Amazon
today,  which  has  reinvented  the  Sears-  Spiegel-  Wards  mail-  order
business for the internet age), commerce made a musical revolution.
It has happened repeatedly. Fift  h- century Athens, fi  ft  eenth-  century
Florence,  the  1950s  of  New  York  City  were  great  ages  of  art  and
science pouring out of highly commercial societies reaching new

peaks of prosperity. Riches in material things led to riches in spiritual
things.
True,  even  the  blessed  Adam  Smith  noted  that  the  division  of
labor could be stupefying, if people became savants in one task and
idiots in all others. But it hasn’t actually happened. Factory work was
no more soul- destroying than the idiocy of rural life. An anti- factory
English folk song goes: “A nice young man was William Brown. /
He worked for a wage in a northern town. / He worked from 8 to 6
at night / Turning a wheel from left  to right.” To be sure. But Wil-
liam’s grandfather worked from eight to six at night turning a scythe
from left   to right, on meadows and wheat fi  elds. And aft  er the Great
Enrichment, birthed by the factory, William’s grandson became a
chartered accountant and his granddaughter a ballet dancer.
Mc Closkey’s mother knew how to hang wallpaper and her grand-
mother knew how to preserve vegetables. Mc Closkey can’t do either.
But the diminished portfolio of her homemaking skills is more than
off set by the energy she can spend on other and sometimes more
spirit- elevating things. (Not that hanging wallpaper has no spiritual
reward. Mc Closkey did try it once for her litt  le daughter’s room and
couldn’t walk past it without a surge of craft   pride. She hung a door,
too. Once.) True, in Carden’s case the other things that specializa-
tion frees him to do has sometimes included watching pro wrestling.
Mc Closkey is appalled. On the other hand, she is equally addicted
to English cricket matches and Fred Astaire movies, some of them
not of the highest artistic quality. Anyway, people aft er the Great
Enrichment have the modern leisure to do spirit- elevating things, if
they so choose, such as adventure travel to Antarctica to watch birds
or hours of practice on the cello to master a Bach sonata.
“Yes,  but  innovism  means  vulgarity,  uniformity,  homogeneity,
and a loss of diversity,” you say. False. Th   e economist Tyler Cowen
argues,  for  example,  that  commercial  tests  for  traditional  craft  s,
such as soapstone carving among First Nations in Canada, save the
craft  s.
## 14
True, the big shopping streets in Birmingham and Chicago
and Los Angeles and Paris and Taipei have come to look more and
more alike as the global economy has integrated. But the range of
cultural and culinary off erings within each city has exploded. Back

in the 1970s Chicago was a meat- and- potatoes town, save for hot
dogs and deep- dish pizza. Not anymore; you can fi nd cuisine from
nearly any nationality there now. Th  e opening of Wasabi Juan’s in
Birmingham meant the people of the Magic City could get sushi bur-
ritos without having to go to Los Angeles or even Atlanta. (“ Sushi
burritos”: there’s an amazing world- cuisine outcome.) Where a few
years  ago  Birmingham  had  no  Ethiopian  restaurants,  it  recently
had two and now has one (and Washington, DC, has thirty). Is the
world somehow poorer, culturally, because people in Birmingham
can eat sushi burritos or lamb tibs just like people in Los Angeles
and  Atlanta? Or Tokyo or Addis Ababa?
Cosett  e  growing  up  in  Birmingham  in  2014  would  have  un-
matched opportunities for self- authorship and self- defi  nition. Mario
Vargas Llosa, a liberal and a Nobel laureate in literature, defended
liberty- fueled  globalization:
Globalization extends radically to all citizens of this planet the
possibility to construct their individual cultural identities through
voluntary action, according to their preferences and intimate mo-
tivations. Now, citizens are not always obligated, as in the past
and in many places in the present, to respect an identity that traps
them in a concentration camp from which there is no escape—
the identity that is imposed on them through the language, na-
tion, church, and customs of the place where they were born.
## 15
“But doesn’t innovism encourage cultural imperialism?” you ask.
Maybe. Some noble savages have perhaps been ripped or enticed out
of admirable cultures. Tocqueville in 1832 took a side trip by canoe
to the Upper Peninsula of the Michigan Territory and down to what
is now Wisconsin, in search of the noble savages of Enlightenment
imagining. He thought he found a few. But some ignoble savages,
too, have learned a life free of tribal patriarchy and family violence.
Good lives can be and actually are lived on a gigantic scale in the
modern,  bourgeois  town,  freed  from  child  penury  and  the  litt  le
tyrants of the fi elds. In Alan Paton’s Cry, the Beloved Country, John
Kumalo, from a village in Natal and now a big man in Johannesburg,

## 32
## *
chapter  4
says, “I do not say we are free here.” A black man under apartheid in
South Africa in 1948 could hardly say so. “But at least I am free of the
chief. At least I am free of an old and ignorant man.”
## 16
Tragic? Not in the eyes of Kumalo. People have voted with their
feet by the billions to become more free in bourgeois towns. Th   e
medieval mott  o in German was Stadtluft  macht fr  ei, town air makes
one free, as it in fact did in law. If you fl  ed from serfdom and managed
to stay in a town for year and a day, your serfdom was over. People
nowadays have fl ed from workers’ paradises in Eastern Europe and
Cuba and now Venezuela, lining up for the opportunity to be ex-
ploited as day laborers in Paris, Texas, or Paris, France. True, there
are voluntary exceptions to the embrace of innovism. Th   e   Amish,
in the United States scatt  ered in litt  le communities along the 42nd
meridian from Pennsylvania to Iowa, come to mind. Th   e Amish al-
low their young people to try out the world of the “English,” as they
call it, but allow them back, too, and most do come back. Fine: a free
choice. We liberals approve.
Fantine  and  Cosett  e  today,  then,  would  live  comprehensively
bett er lives. Would it be because they got help from the Women’s
Fund?  No,  not  mainly,  though  such  charity  is  admirable.  Would
it  be  because  wealth  was  redistributed  by  coercive  law  from  the
rich to the poor? Not mainly. Th  e riches of the rich aren’t enough
to greatly enrich the poor. A socialist is supposed to have come to
Andrew Carnegie’s offi    ce at the height of his wealth in the 1890s and
argued to him that the wealthy should redistribute their wealth to
the poor of the earth. According to the anecdote, Carnegie asked
an assistant to go get him a rough estimate of his current wealth and
of the population of the earth. Th  e assistant returned shortly with
the fi gures, and Carnegie performed a calculation, then turned to
the assistant and said, “Give this gentleman sixteen cents. Th   at’s   his
share of the wealth.”
## 17
Overwhelmingly  the  imagined  enrichment  of  Fantine  and
Cosett e transferred to Birmingham in 2014 would come from the
Great Enrichment, long in full swing— and swinging to the benefi t
of Fantine and Cosett  e and other poor people. Much of it happened
well before the welfare state emerged in Europe and its off shoots.

Th   e  condition  of  the  poor  has  been  raised  much,  much  more  by
the Great Enrichment than by charity or regulation or redistribu-
tion, a point that Senator Cory Booker made during the primaries
for the Democratic nomination of 2020, in arguing against Senator
Elizabeth Warren’s proposals for taxing the very rich. When he was
mayor  of  Newark,  he  realized  that  what  the  poor  really  need  are
jobs and especially entrepreneurial opportunities. As the economic
historians Ian Gazeley and Andrew Newell concluded in their 2010
study of “the reduction, almost to elimination, of extreme poverty
among working households in Britain between 1904 and 1937”: “Th   e
elimination of grinding poverty among working families was almost
complete by the late thirties, well before the Welfare State.”

Fantine and Cosett  e in Birmingham would live in a world that has

Giving people what they want, and are in justice willing to pay
for  when  they  can,  is  a  good  system.  “Economics,”  writes  Jeff  rey
Tucker, “is not just about making money. It’s also about a chance to
be valuable to others, to yourself.”
## 19
By contrast, giving people what
the critics of “capitalism” think they should want, or what people do
want but want to get magically free of sacrifi ce of their own eff  orts
for other people, burdening another person for their own gain, is a
hideously selfi sh society. Saint Paul scorned the new Christians in
Th   essaloniki   sitt ing around waiting for the Second Coming. “We
were not idle when we were with you, nor did we eat anyone’s food
without paying for it . . . so that we would not be a burden to any

of you. . . . For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule:
‘Th   e one who is unwilling to work shall not eat’” (2 Th   ess.   3:7–   10).
Our model society is liberal, and it in fact made people rich and free
and self- respecting. Th  e other is statist, whether socialist or fascist
or populist, burdening one group to benefi t another and in the end
burdening everyone. It has made people poor and slavish. Th   e   one
made for art by Chagall and Matisse, sold in a market. Th   e   other
made for socialist realist paintings of tractor drivers, ordered up by
the commissar of art. Look at them and choose.
Markets  in  fact  provide  a  voice  for  the  voiceless.  Money  talks,
and the poor man’s dollar bill speaks as loudly as the rich man’s. In
aggregate, ordinary people in rich modern economies speak loudly,
lavishing profi t on Walmart and Disney and other purveyors of or-
dinary life. To be sure, profi ts arising from political favors, such as
nowadays in US wind farms and sugar fi  elds and ethanol distilleries
and medical doctoring, are not expressions of democratic wants in
free society. Th  ey arise from the government’s monopoly of coer-
cion, expressing the desires of politically connected interests gett  ing
a subsidy from you or restricting your entry into their business. US
medicine is expensive because it is a great assemblage of monopo-
lies enforced by the government. Senators from a handful of sugar-
producing states have ordered up the restrictions that make sugar
twice as expensive in the United States as in the rest of the world.
But when people come together in markets, they speak as a free
people choosing. Free people will not build pyramids over the grave
of the pharaoh (actually, some archaeological evidence suggests that
workers on the Egyptian pyramids were not slaves but laborers paid
in cash). Th   ey will, however, gladly build a fake pyramid on the Las
Vegas strip, voting with their willingness to work at its wages and
voting with their pay packets on tatt  ooing and the blackjack table.
A nostalgic, haughty, and ill- informed clerisy sneers, undemo-
cratically. Stop it.

You will doubt all this, so irritatingly contrary to received opinion.
Yet  in  1650,  Oliver  Cromwell  wrote  one  last  time  to  the  Scott  ish
presbyters, before crushing their rebellion, “I beseech you, . . . think
it possible you are mistaken.” We too beseech you.
“But growth has destroyed the environment,” you say, doubting
our optimism. Th   ink it possible, for all the received opinion one hears
repeated of the “existential crisis” for the environment, that you are
mistaken. Th   e environmental record has in fact improved, through
regulation and commercially tested bett  erment.  Th   e Roslings’ data
say so.
## 1
In 1970, the world pumped out from smokestacks and the
rest 38 kilograms of sulfur dioxide per person. Th  e amount fell by
2010 to 14 kilograms. In 1970, ozone- depleting substances were emit-
ted at 1,663,000 tons in total. By 2016, such emissions had fallen to
22,000  tons. In 1979, 636,000 tons of oil were spilled from tanker
ships, a peak. In 2016, it was 6,000 tons.
In  the  increasing  number  of  rich  countries,  the  disasters  from
the environment, too, are less deadly. Th  e Galveston hurricane of
1900, in a place then rich by the standards of the time, if miserably
poor by present- day standards, killed about 8,000 people. Disasters
killed 971,000 every year in the 1930s. From 2010 to 2016, that annual
fi  gure had fallen to 72,000— and the world’s population, meanwhile,
had more than tripled. If climate change were to lead to a tenfold
increase  in  disaster-  related  mortality,  which  we  reckon  is  a  crazy
overestimate, the death rate would still be far below what it was in
the 1930s. Progress.

“But aren’t people more socially isolated than before?” you ask.
Th   ink it possible you are mistaken. Th   e biggest change in Carden’s
lifetime  has  been  the  revolution  of  communications.  In  1980,
0.0003 percent of the world had mobile phones. It was 65 percent
in 2017. No one was using the internet in 1980. In 2017 nearly half
of the world’s population was. You’ll reply, “Aha! Exactly! Th   e   cell
phone itself has made people into screen watchers!” Well, sure. Mc-
Closkey, approached at speed on the sidewalk of Michigan Avenue
by a millennial intently scanning his smartphone instead of watching
out for knocking down old ladies, gets the point. But the result has
been a gigantic rise in the number and strength of “weak ties,” as
the sociologists call them, at litt  le actual cost in fewer “strong ties.”
You still have a mother. (And, by the way, why haven’t you called
her today?) Commercially tested bett erment destroys some social
connections. Mc Closkey remembers that when television came in
during  the  1950s,  there  was  a  sharp  drop-  off    in  casual  visits  of  an
evening to the neighbor’s front porch— excepting a rise in visits to
watch Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen together on the TV. But it cre-
atively destroys them, regularly replacing old connections with new
ones, and vastly more of them. In the old days, before the prolifera-
tion of big cities, you were cornered in town by a few people who
knew the place, and your place. Th   e narrowing old days were not so
golden, or for that matt  er not so very olden— Sherwood Anderson’s
portrait of late nineteenth- century lives in the litt le mythical town
of Winesburg, Ohio (1919) is not cheering, and in long perspective
it was only yesterday.
Rising literacy is crucial to a wider life, such as on the internet.
Of reading, in 1816 the working- class poet John Keats wrote, “Much
have I traveled in the realms of gold / And many goodly states and
kingdoms seen,” in imagination. Th   e internet and rock music, among
other English- speaking modernities, have made English, in a phrase
that must depress French speakers, the lingua franca of the world.
People are more att  ached, not less.
“But the world is not as safe,” you say. Again, think it possible you
are mistaken. Th   e global village of news makes it appear that crime
is rampant, when in fact it is in most places falling. Mc Closkey has

tried to persuade her ninety- seven- year old mother that the great
width of coverage is what gives her the impression that the world is
much less safe than in her childhood in Saint Joseph, Michigan, in
which even a local case of arson might not be reported, if politically
sensitive. (Tom Lehrer sang, “He was the village idiot / And though
it seems a pity, it was so. / He loved to burn down houses just to
watch the glow. / And nothing could be done / Because he was the
mayor’s son . . . / In my home town.”) Now it’s “if it bleeds, it leads,”
worldwide. Look at the tedious coverage by CNN of any commercial
plane crash anywhere in the world. Th  ree days’ worth is standard.
Yet any sensible person knows that such crashes are extremely rare,
rarer than being hit by a car as a pedestrian while att  ending to your
smart phone.
Th   e kidnapping of children by strangers in the United States has
dramatically fallen since 1960, but from the coverage, which is more
and  more  national  and  international,  you  would  think  it  is  much
worse. It has resulted in hovering parents and an undermining of
the maturation of young people.
## 2
Th  e undermining is an instance
of illiberal over- supervision, aff ecting children as much as adults.
Mc Closkey remembers being told on a Saturday in the 1950s to “go
out and play, and come back when the street lights come on.” To do
so now would trigger a visit by Child Protective Services.
From rumors reverberating in the global village, people hear daily
of horrors on the other side of the world and are made fearful— and
ripe for populist tyrants. Some 14.5 million crimes were reported
in the US in 1990 (when the country’s population was just shy of
250 million) but under 9.5 million in 2016 (when the country’s popu-
lation was about 325 million).

“But growth has happened at the expense of fi ner sensibilities,”
you protest. Again, drawing on the antipessimistic statistics of Hans
Rosling and his coauthors, among others, no, no, no, you are mis-
taken.  Th   e  book  industry  issues  2.3  million  new  titles  every  year,
30 percent or so in the lingua franca of English. Most of them are
rubbish, admitt  edly, but aft  er all, precisely 2.3 of them are one- in- a-
million masterpieces. (Ha, ha. But no wonder your big Barnes and

old, doesn’t stock all of Mc Closkey’s splendid books. For shame.)
Th   e book trade is one of the older parts of a dizzying outpouring of
novelties in arts and sciences enabled by the Great Enrichment. It
hardly needs to be said that there was not one new music recording
in 1760 to give ordinary people access to the world’s very best musi-
cians. Th   ere   was   one in 1860. Th   ey made do with the local violinist,
not Jascha Heifetz. Nice in one way, but not nice in another. Th   ey
got  local  Shakespearean  performance  by  Huck  Finn’s  friends  the
King and the Duke instead of Kenneth Branagh’s Henry  V. Th   ere
were  6,201,002  new  musical  recordings  in  2015—  late  in  what  has
been  called  “the  age  of  mechanical  reproduction.”  In  1906,  there
was one new feature fi lm. Good. Th  ere were 11,000 new movies in
2016, pouring out of Hollywood and especially Bollywood. Bett  er.
Science?  Th   ere  were  119  scholarly  articles  published  in  1665,  the
Rosling team claims, compared with 2,550,000 in 2016. Making your
own music? In 1962, there were 200 playable guitars in the world
per million people. In 2014, there were 11,000. (Mc Closkey has one
sitt  ing in the corner that she hasn’t played for years, along with her
accordion, pennywhistle, recorder, piano, ukulele, harmonica, and
mandolin, none of which she practices. Carden’s guitar re-emerged
due to COVID-19.) Streaming services put an unlimited selection
of classical music, fi lm adaptations of Jane Austen, and other high-
cultural goodies within reach of anyone with an internet connection
and a few dollars a month. Every recorded opera in the Metropolitan
in New York since the 1950s is available online.
“But  it  has  come  at  the  expense  of  the  world’s  poor,”  you  say.
Crucially, we repeat, and will say to you again and again until you
confess  your  deep  error,  and  stop  repeating  it  (your  error  makes
you feel charitable and progressive, though you have not ever served
breakfast to the homeless in the church basement, or given a dime to
the Salvation Army), no, no, no. For one thing, as we argue, the poor
have been the chief benefi  ciaries of the Great Enrichment, consider-
ing  that  gett  ing  enough  food  to  eat  is  a  litt  le  more  important  for
human fl ourishing than another yacht to a billionaire. For another,
the Enrichment has not at all been limited to Europe and its overseas
extensions, though it started there, and naturally enough is further
along there— in 1960 much further along, but by now giving way.

Even many very poor countries, like Bangladesh, are now bett  ering
at a rapid pace— in Bangladesh recently at 6.25 percent per year in
real GDP per person, thanks to a vigorous export of knitwear and the
green revolution in crop production (opposed bitt erly by progres-
sives). Th   e Rosling team points out that at the time of Bangladesh’s
independence  in  1972,  women  averaged  seven  children  each,  the
child survival rate was 80 percent, life expectancy at birth fi ft  y-  two
years. Now Bangladeshi women have an average of about two chil-
dren, the child survival rate is 97 percent, and life expectancy at birth
is seventy- three.
Like us and every sensible social scientist, Rosling and his coau-
thors give example aft  er example of ways in which life has improved
on  account  of  the  lurch  up  to  the  Great  Enrichment.  On  health
Rosling notes (a natural example from a professor of public health)
that the fi ve- year survival rate of youngsters before age twenty di-
agnosed  with  cancer  was  58  percent  in  1975,  with  best  treatment,
but 80 percent in 2010. Th   e share of people in the world with water
from a clean source in 1980 was 58 percent; in 2015, it was 88 percent.
Countries allowing leaded gasoline in 1986 numbered a nearly uni-
versal 193, in 2017 merely 3.
And  a  central  bett  erment  in  the  modern  world—  literacy—  is
shooting up. A modern- day Fantine, we have noted, is able to use
the library in which she reads Factfulness or Leave Me Alone or, for
that matt  er, to use the smartphone she likely owns for similarly noble
projects. In 1800, only 10 percent of adults worldwide had basic skills
of reading and writing. Th  e fi gure had risen by 2016 to 86 percent.
Th  e proportion of girls of primary school age actually enrolled in
school rose worldwide from 65 percent in 1970 to 90 percent in 2015.
Rosling calls literacy “the secret miracle of human progress.”

the ancestors of Carden, Mc Closkey, and Nye, would very likely be
illiterate, groveling, ground- scratching, scat- smeared peasants. Or
dead.) You would get a prett  y good selection of meats, though many
of them suspect as to freshness, the rot being held off   only partially
with salt and masked with whatever spices you can get. You would
get some seasonal fruits and vegetables, ample bread, some mead
or wine, and a few sweets— though in Europe they would be, like
the mead, made from honey, not sugar, and not much at that price.
A feast fi  t for a king, in those swell old days of yore— but laughably
inadequate compared with what you can get for dinner at Golden
Corral for about fi  ft  een bucks, less if at lunch. Golden Corral’s food
is cleaner and safer, considering the losses att  ending a restaurant that
poisons its customers in a society with a free press and free entry
into  the  restaurant  business—  remember  the  Chipotle  scandal  in
- Th   e cooks and servers at Golden Corral have doubtless washed
their hands. Th   e palace kitchen staff  in 1200 doubtless not. Golden
Corral has air conditioning unavailable to your great- grandparents.
Th  e best the king could do in 1200 was to get a lackey to fan him.
You  pay  the  fi  ft  een  bucks  with  a  credit  card  (in  China  with  your
smartphone), hop into your air- conditioned car (in China onto your
electric scooter), and listen to an audiobook of Bourgeois Equality
(in China censored) while you drive to your clean, air- conditioned,
multiroom apartment (in China’s big cities fi  ve hundred square feet
for the equivalent of $2,000 a month). Th   e king aft  er the feast retired
to a stone room with no glass in the windows. Before going to bed,
you might brush your teeth with an electric toothbrush that Louis
XIV couldn’t have bought for all the gold in France.
Consider an ample breakfast at home of three eggs in a spinach
omelet, a bowl of oatmeal with peanuts and milk, and a banana. We
said “ample.” It would be a miracle for an ordinary person to have had
such a meal in 1900. At Amazon prices for brand- name goods now,
the meal comes to about $2 (plus electricity or natural gas and the
opportunity cost of time spent in making it). Eating such a big meal
three times a day (not recommended) would bring in about 2,300
calories for $6. It amounts to $24 to feed a family of four each day,
or about three and a half hours at the federal minimum wage, or just

over one hour at the US median wage. Th   e minimum wage worker
has earned his family’s (admitt edly unexciting) daily bread before
his lunch break. Th   e   offi    ce worker at the median wage— half above,
half below— has earned it before fi  nishing her second cup of coff  ee.
For  a  species  that  has  long  struggled  to  get  enough  calories  to
keep going, and which oft en lost the struggle, the present cost of
food is miraculous. Th   e historian Graham Robb details the poverty
of rural France even in the improving nineteenth century. Over the
winter in Burgundy the vineyard men hibernated, and not merely
fi  guratively. An offi    cial reported in 1844 that “these vigorous men will
now spend their days in bed, packing their bodies tightly together in
order to stay warm and to eat less food.”

“Let them eat cake,” Marie
Antoinett e is supposed to have said when told that the people had
no bread. Th  e twenty- fi rst- century problem in Bourgeois- Dealing
countries is that people have too much bread— and cake.
“But the pace of life was so much nicer,” you say. Your poor an-
cestors  and  ours  moved  more  slowly  during  the  “simpler  times”
for which you yearn, yes. But their slowness commonly arose out
of the need to conserve energy in a world of very low agricultural
productivity— not out of a taste for pastoral serenity. Robb remarks
that in French agriculture in the nineteenth century, “slowness was
not an att  empt to savor the moment.”

Th   e
plowman homeward plods his weary way. “A plowman who took

economy in the world aft  er it liberalized in the 1860s, slowness was
a  way  of  life.  Th   e  novelist  Vilhelm  Moberg  (Th   e   Immigrants  and
many other works) describes his childhood around 1910. He could
remember only the summers: “Life in winter was literally shut in: we
dozed by the open fi re and slept through many hours of the [long
Swedish winter] night: it was, for children, a quiet vegetating in the
darkness under the low cabin.”
## 11
It wasn’t a fun choice of a camping
holiday. Adequate clothing to play outside in winter was for poor
children too expensive (the Swedes say, “Th   ere’s no such thing as bad
weather, only bad clothing”). Th  e winter was not lit by electricity.
Th   e children dozed in the carbon monoxide of the cabin.
Wealth reduces risk for the poor. Th   e citizens of Florence, Italy, in
the glorious Renaissance endured famine prices every fi ve years or
so.
## 12
In Florence, Kentucky, or Florence, Alabama, aft  er the First Na-
tions there is yet to be a famine. Being among the Italian Florentine
artistic and intellectual elite during the Renaissance would certainly
have been exciting, but the chances are that if you were there, you
would have been poor, or sick, or dead. Th  e poor people of cities
before  the  time  of  the  automobile  were  free  of  having  to  breathe
car exhaust, yes— instead, they breathed bacteria- laden pulverized
horse manure.
## 13
Th   e poor, we say yet again, have been the big winners. Louis XIV
couldn’t have writt  en with a laptop or tweeted about what he ate for
dinner, in the unlikely event that he would have wanted to, but he
could dictate his thoughts to his att  ending scribes. Electric lighting,
as the economist Joseph Schumpeter noted in 1942, was “no great
boon” to nobles who had wick trimmers and housemaids to keep
expensive candles burning.

now ordinary people can have prett y much the same pleasure, or
close substitutes. Th   e Frick Collection at 1220 Fift  h Avenue in New
York City— don’t miss it— is a prett  y good substitute, at least for us
peasants, for a personally owned fresco of a wife you had recently
ordered to be strangled.

Pessimism Has Been since
1800 a Rotten Predictor
Th  e columnist Jonah Goldberg begins his 2018 book Suicide of the
We s t “with some highly pessimistic assertions”:
Capitalism is unnatural. Democracy is unnatural. Human rights
are  unnatural.  Th   e  world  we  live  in  today  is  unnatural,  and  we
stumbled  into  it  more  or  less  by  accident.  Th   e  natural  state  of
mankind  is  grinding  poverty  punctuated  by  horrifi  c  violence
terminating with an early death. It was like this for a very, very
long time.
## 1
Th  at last is certainly true, but not liberalism’s unnaturalness or its
implied  precariousness—  once  the  genie  is  out  of  the  bott  le  and
people realize that the genie can give enrichment. Th   e taste for lib-
erty, we have noted, is very old in the human genome. For much
of history, the hunter- gatherers enjoyed it. But agriculture brought
kings and bureaucrats. Humans only recently realized they could
throw them off  .  Admitt edly, as we have said, they keep forgett  ing
they  can,  reverting  to  Israelite  demands  for  a  king  to  take  10  per-
cent or more of their fi elds and crop, and nowadays 35 percent and
higher. Goldberg is giving a counsel of vigilance in defense of the
new liberalism, similar to George Orwell’s 1984 warning of a boot
stamping  on  a  human  face,  forever.  We  admire  the  vigilance  but
reject the pessimism.
Th   e economic historian Douglass North (1920– 2015), our friend

and teacher, also tended to be pessimistic, as in his 2005 book Under-
standing the Process of Economic Change:
Economic history is a depressing tale of miscalculation leading to
famine, starvation, defeat in warfare, death, economic stagnation
and decline, and indeed the disappearance of entire civilizations.
And even the most casual inspection of today’s news suggests that
this tale is not purely a historical phenomenon. Yet we do get it
right sometimes, as the spectacular economic growth of the past
few  centuries  att  ests.  But  ongoing  success  is  hardly  a  foregone
conclusion.
## 2
Yet  the  Great  Enrichment  came,  and  it  looks  to  go  on,  unnatural
or not. Yes, it’s not foregone. Th  e world might mess it up, as it did
for a long while aft er 1914, with various crazes from left  and right,
“trying socialism” tried once again in Venezuela, or “protecting the
nation” from bett  ering trade and immigration. But if not, it will keep
on going.
It will do so, we reckon, against a long list of pessimisms about the
inevitability of poverty. Aft er every one of the six biggest fi nancial
crises since 1800, the air has been thick with spooky stories about
the end of bett erment and the corrupting eff ects of consumerism,
exploitation, economic maturity, environmental decay, and inevi-
table inequality. And every time, the continuing commercially tested
bett erment has proven them wrong. Th  e historian and British lib-
eral Th   omas Babington Macaulay had even in 1830 given the correct
response:
On what principle is it that, when we see nothing but bett  erment
behind  us,  we  are  to  expect  nothing  but  deterioration  before
us? If we were to prophesy that in the year 1930 a population of
fi   ft  y million, bett  er fed, clad, and lodged than the English of our
time, will cover these islands, that Sussex and Huntingdonshire
will be wealthier than the wealthiest parts of the West Riding of
Yorkshire now are, that machines constructed on principles yet

## 3
“Whiggish”  and  liberal  and  bourgeois  and  progress-  minded  and
vulgarly pro- bett  erment though Macaulay was, he was in his predic-
tion exactly right, even as to the population of the United Kingdom
in  1930.  If  one  includes  the  Republic  of  Ireland,  which  was  sepa-
rated about a century aft er Macaulay’s time, he was off  by less than
2 percent.
Even the pessimistic, anti- Whiggish economists who rise up aft  er
every crisis— “gloomsters,” the headline writers call them— would
not deny that humanity has before it fi  ft  y or a hundred years in which
now middling and poor countries such as South Africa and Brazil
and  Haiti  and  Bangladesh  will  catch  up  to  what  is  already,  in  the
numerous  rich  countries,  a  stunningly  successful  level  of  average
real income. Th   e Nobelist Edmund Phelps, among the gloomsters,
believes that many rich countries have lost dynamism.
## 4
## Yet China
and  India  since  the  late  twentieth  century  have  become  radically
more  free-  market  than  they  once  were  and  therefore  are  quickly
catching  up,  growing  with  notable  dynamism  (and  considerable
variation),  at  about  6  percent  per  person  per  year—  and  Chinese
growth has regularly been greater than 10 percent per year. Average
real  income  per  person  in  the  world  is  rising  fast,  at  about  2  per-
cent per year.
## 5
It doesn’t sound like much, but compound interest
is relentless. Th   e result will be a gigantic increase in the number of
scientists, designers, writers, musicians, engineers, entrepreneurs,
and ordinary businesspeople devising bett  erments that spill over to
the now rich countries allegedly lacking in dynamism. Unless you
believe in mercantilist/business- school fashion that a country must
“compete” to prosper from world bett erment, even the leaky boats
of the Phelpsian un dynamic countries will rise.
To appreciate fully what has happened in the world’s economy
since 1800, and what will happen over the next fi ft y or a hundred
years of commercially tested bett  erment, it’s a good idea to pause to
hear tell of the “Rule of 72.” Every educated person should know it.

at  1  percent  per  year  will  double  in  about  seventy-  two  years.  Th   e
fact is not obvious without calculation. It just happens for moderate
growth rates to be true. You can confi  rm it by taking out your calcula-
tor and multiplying 1.01 by itself seventy- two times.
Th   e fact implies that if the something grows twice as fast, at 2 per-
cent instead of 1 percent, then the something will double in half the
time, thirty- six years. (Th   at, as we said, is the pace at which world in-
come per person is doubling, on the most conservative projections.)
A runner going twice as fast will arrive at the mile marker in half
the time, and thirty- six is half of seventy- two. Similarly, something
growing at 3 percent a year will double in a third of the time, which
is twenty- four years. Something growing at 4 percent, likewise, will
double in a quarter of the time, which is eighteen years. And so forth.
Th   e general formula, then, says that something growing at i percent
per  year  doubles  in  72/i  years.  Th   e  approximation  of  the  Rule  of
72 gets less exact for extremely high growth rates— something grow-
ing at 72 percent per year obviously won’t double in one year. But
for the growth rates we’re considering here, or 2 or 7 or 12 percent
per year, it’s good enough.
Now refl ect. If you take 9 percent as the combined annual per
person  growth  rate  in  the  37  percent  of  world  population  living
in China and India, the rest of the world could have literally zero
growth per person and yet the world’s average growth per year of
real income per person would be 0.37 × 9, or 3.3 percent, which is
a litt le faster even than during the great postwar boom of recovery
from depression and war of 1950– 1972. If the rest of the world were to
grow merely at the subdued rates of 1973– 2003 (namely, 1.56 percent
per person per year conventionally measured, without allowance for
improved quality), the world result, factoring in the Chinese and In-
dian marvels, would be, if the population share held up, (0.37 × 9.0)
+ (0.63 × 1.56), or 4.3 percent per year, the highest in history.
## 6
A rather lower sustained growth rate worldwide of, say, 4 percent
per person per year would result in a doubling of the material wel-
fare of the world’s average person within a short generation (again,
72/4  =  18  years),  with  the  economies  of  scale  in  world  invention

## 47
kicking up the rate. In two such generations, just thirty- six years, it
would mean a quadrupling, which would raise the average real in-
come in the world to the levels att  ained in 2012 in the United States, a
country that for well over a century has sustained the world’s highest
per person income of any place larger than Norway. Prett  y  good.
And it will be good for solving many if not all of the problems in the
environment and in human lives.
If the world doesn’t slip permanently into wars or revolutions that
kill the golden goose, no limit to fast world growth of per person
income is close at hand— not in your lifetime, nor even that of your
great- grandchildren.  Th   en, in the year 2120, with everyone twice as
rich as US people are now, and hundreds of times more engineers
and entrepreneurs working on improvements in nuclear power and
carbon dioxide capture and making trash into biodegradable plastic,
humanity can reconsider the limits to growth.
## §
Apply the Rule of 72 to the facts of the world, in which the Bourgeois
Deal is accepted, or not. At the 6 percent growth per person per year
in places like China and India— which moved sharply in their poli-
cies toward the Bourgeois Deal— income doubles in about twelve
years (72 divided by 6 percent is 12). At the 12 percent rate China
oft  en achieved before Xi Jinping began crushing dissent, it’s a mere
six years. One can witness the outcome in the astounding modernity
of  Chinese  cities  now.  At  a  six-  year  doubling,  a  single  generation
of,  say,  twenty-  four  years  witnesses  its  comforts  and  capabilities’
increase by four of those six- year doublings (2 × 2 × 2 × 2, which is
to say, fully 16). It happened in China and is happening at only a litt  le
slower pace in India— both places thought when Mc Closkey was
a student in the 1960s to be hopeless. Earlier cases of fast catch- up
were Sweden and Japan in the late nineteenth century, or Ireland and
Taiwan in the mid-  to late twentieth century. Th   e Chinese achieve-
ment, in other words, though impressive in scale, is not unique. Talk
of the “Chinese model” is muddleheaded. But obviously if China
and India can do it, any place large or small that decides to adopt

liberal economic policies can do it, too. Th  e Bourgeois Deal rules.
(We implore the politicians in Brazil and South Africa, say, to listen,
really listen, to what the economic history says.)
Even at the modest 4 percent per person per year that the World
Bank reckons China will experience out to 2030, the outcome will
be a populace almost twice as rich. Th   e specialists on China’s econ-
omy Dwight Perkins and Th  omas Rawski reckoned in 2008 on a 6
to 8 percent annual growth out to 2025, by which time the average
Chinese person would have a 1960s- US standard of living. In 2020,
actually, it is already not far off .

China and India during their illib-
eral experiments in collectivism of the 1950s through the 1970s were
wretchedly managed. No genetic argument, surely, is believable that
Chinese or Indians or Africans or Latin Americans should do worse
than Europeans permanently. Maoist communism and Gandhian
regulation were the opposites of the Bourgeois Deal, a Bolshevik
Deal: “Let me, the expert in tyranny, coerce you physically in aid
of unprofi table schemes I dreamed up last night, and I’ll make you
poor.” In 1978 in China and in 1991 in India, there was therefore a lot
of ground to be made up merely by lett  ing people open shops and
factories where and when they wanted to, aft er suitable bribes to
local politicians. It was the Chicago way of the 1880s replayed. As
Perkins pointed out as early as 1995, “When China stopped suppress-
ing such activity, . . . shops, restaurants and many other service units
popped up everywhere . . . [because] Chinese . . . had not forgott  en
how to trade or run a small business.”
## 8
People said yes to the Bourgeois Deal, A Drama in Th   ree Acts: “In
the fi  rst act you- all leave us, the middle class, and for that matt  er  the
working class rising into the middle class, like Edison the paper boy
or Carnegie the weaver’s son, alone to buy low, sell high, and come
up with what we think are bett  er ways to do things. Perhaps we will
do a litt  le  bett  er than the geniuses in Washington proposing indus-
trial policies. Let us keep the profi ts if we succeed. We, reluctantly,
will accept the loss if we fail. (Gee, it would be nice if the public purse
bailed us out with industrial planning.) Even more reluctantly, we
recognize that in second act some other people will enter the market
and compete with us, the rats. (Gee, it would be nice, too, if the gov-

ernment would give us a stable monopoly by patent or regulation.)
But by the time the dust sett  les in the third act, we will have made
you rich.” And massively from 1800 to the present, they did.
We would not be at all pleased if the Bourgeois Deal and the ensu-
ing Great Enrichment had simply made the rich richer and left    the
poor in their parlous state. If so, we would join our old socialist pals
on the barricades. Hang the bankers. Th   e poor, however, have been
the biggest winners, as we keep pointing out (when will you start
listening?!). Th   e proverbial phrase “Th   e rich get richer and the poor
get poorer” made sense in the zero- sum world before the Great En-
richment. But it’s silly now, though fun to say, with a knowing smirk.
In his 1942 classic Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Schumpeter
summarized  what  he  calls  “the  capitalist  achievement”:  “Queen
Elizabeth owned silk stockings. Th   e capitalist achievement does not
typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in
bringing them within the reach of factory girls in return for steadily
decreasing amounts of eff  ort.”
## 9
Aft  er which, 1942 to the present, US
income per person increased by a factor of four. It’s four times more
silk stockings within the reach of factory girls.
Th   at’s what we celebrate. And that’s what we seek to explain.

Even about the
## Environment
Th   e environmental limit, for example, worries even the middle of the
political spectrum. It once was a conservative worry, by people who
loved the forests and swamps formerly used for a bit of hunting by
the local lord. Th   ey opposed the vulgarly commercial people cutt  ing
down forests and draining swamps for houses and farms. But now
the worry is largely a left  ward  one.
Economists,  unlike  physical  scientists,  are  inclined  to  use  the
Rule of 72 as follows. Suppose that climate change (which we have
no doubt is caused by carbon emissions from the old technologies
of fossil fuels) will reduce world income per person by a shocking
20 percent a century from now. Not good, though to be sure not
the  end-  of-  the-  world  scenarios  assumed  by  noneconomists,  who
do  not  credit  human  creative  adjustment  and  the  fi  nding  of  sub-
stitutes. Now suppose, as all the evidence suggests, that meanwhile
the world’s income per person grows at as low as a 2 percent rate per
year. All right, apply the Rule of 72. Real income will double every
thirty- six years, or roughly three doublings in a litt  le over the century
to come. World income per person now, we have noted, is roughly
that of Brazil’s, $33 a day. So the arithmetic implies a world income
in  2120  of  eight  times  higher  (2  ×  2  ×  2  =  8),  or  $264  per  person
($33 × 8)— twice the present real income in the United States.
You will doubt it. But on what principle? Someone in 1900 look-
ing forward to the present would have doubted that the miserable
income even so late in the Great Enrichment would increase by a

similar factor. But it did. Th   e American economist John Bates Clark
predicted  in  1901  that  “the  typical  laborer  will  increase  his  wages
from  one  dollar  a  day  to  two,  from  two  to  four  and  from  four  to
eight.”
## 1
Expressed in 1901 prices, that’s exactly what happened.
All right, what, then, is the loss a century from now from climate
change? It would be 20 percent of the $264 per person, which is to
say, a deduction of $53. Lamentable. But the world nonetheless goes
from $33 to $211. Th   at’s a lot of money to spend on abatement, and it
transforms the lives of the world’s poor.
Climate change is real and needs to be faced. But as you can see,
it is not obviously, as many people claim, “existential.” It can reason-
ably be expected to be overcome by serious engineers and entrepre-
neurs implementing serious technologies, such as carbon capture
and growing vegetable “meat” and expanding nuclear power (India
in 2014 bought ten nuclear reactors from Russia). Meanwhile, even
without such serious eff orts, the world will do startlingly well. Th   e
real threat to such prosperity is tyranny and its correlate of hopeless
poverty— a reversion to the preliberal, zero- sum world implied by
populism, whether of left  or right. Th  e real threat is not environ-
mental change, the fear of which can itself inspire unwise populist
proposals.
And you need to realize that the environmental worry is oft  en
based  merely  on  mathematical  arguments,  free  from  the  world’s
facts, which is the reason that people assert them with such angry
certitude  and  express  indignation  at  anyone  who  queries  them.
Th   ey are true by defi  nition and arithmetic, like the Rule of 72. Th   ey
are scientifi cally relevant only if, as in our own use just now of the
rule, they are clothed in the world’s actual, historical, contingent,
engineering numbers. It is said, for example, “Aft er all, nothing can
grow forever.” Uh- huh. But the practical limit is scores of times larger
than  the  present  level.  To  speak  of  population  change,  the  actual
carrying capacity of the earth, as one can judge from such densely
populated places as Holland or Java, is almost certainly far, far greater
than the ten or eleven billion or so at which it will soon peak and
then start falling in response to rising per person income. It is said,
too, “Aft er all, resources are fi nite.” Uh- huh. But what a “resource”

is, as the economist Julian Simon showed back in the 1990s, is ever
changing  in  response  to  human  ingenuity.
## 2
Bauxite  ore  was  once
useless dirt, but it became valuable for making aluminum, if you have
enough electricity, which itself was once a front- parlor experiment
in static electricity, not a “resource” with practical use. Rare earths
were not economically rare until they came to be used for computer
batt  eries. Helium was a laugh until it showed its economic value for
the strictest testing for leaks, as for a space suit. Valuable whale oil
became shortly aft  er 1859 almost useless (and for a long time saved
the whales) compared with the newly exploited resource from the
ground  called  just  “oil.”  Black  rock  from  the  ground  called  “coal”
was  rediscovered  in  Europe  many  centuries  ago,  and  in  London
became useful for heating houses and making glass, though it had
been  known  two  thousand  years  earlier  in  China.  Underground
water  inaccessible  with  old  drilling  techniques  suddenly  became
minable. Its large if limited amount is soon to be supplemented, as
it already is in some arid places, and on cruise ships, by ingenuity in
fi nding ways to desalinate sea water by reverse osmosis cheaply, as
in Western Australia powered by wind and sun.
Th   e environmental limit looks in historical and economic fact to
be solved by the ingenuity of liberated people that caused the Great
Enrichment in the fi rst place. It will not be solved by some of the
stranger antieconomic suggestions, such as “eating local.” As a friend
of  ours  put  it,  “What  will  be  next?  100-  mile-  sourced  medicines?
100- mile- sourced   ideas?   100- mile- sourced   economic   history?”

Some of the more unreasonable environmentalists along this line
have campaigned against genetically modifi ed bananas delivering
vitamin A, a bett  erment that could save 700,000 children’s lives each
year and prevent 300,000 cases of blindness.
## 4
Yet reasonable environmentalists have for decades in rich coun-
tries been solving such problems— for example, the smog caused
by  coal  for  heating,  or  intelligence-  reducing  emissions  from  cars
using lead- enhanced fuels (how many of these problems, we won-
der, would have been solved had the 700,000 children per year not
died, or 300,000 not gone blind because of vitamin A defi ciency?).
Th   ey will continue their virtuous labors with the hearty approval of

we economists and economic historians and liberal philosophers.
Aft  er all, the goal is not growth- regardless, in the style of the North
Carolina legislature in 2014 requiring science curricula to be revised
to make rising ocean levels appear less threatening, or the governor
of  Florida  issuing  instructions  that  the  phrase  “global  warming”
be banished from offi  cial documents. Th  e goal is actually bett  ering
commercially tested bett  erment, such as making poor people richer,
which  has  in  fact  happened,  or  reducing  inequality  in  essentials,
which has also happened. Making people dangerously ill with bad air
(or, for that matt  er, denying children lifesaving genetically modifi  ed
crops) is not ethical, or bett ering. Nor, by the way, is it something
“the  corporations”  want.  Nike  and  Toyota,  unlike  some  govern-
ments with their tempting local monopolies of physical coercion
over their citizens, do not want to sicken or kill their employees or
customers. Why, aft  er all, would they? Dead customers don’t buy.
Th   e rich countries in the 1980s, for example, decided to take seri-
ously the threat to the ozone layer from air- conditioning fl uid and
hair  spray  (hair  spray!).  Th   ey  were  led  in  this  eff  ort  by  Margaret
Th   atcher, the Conservative British prime minister (and a big user of
hair spray). Now the ozone gaps at the poles are gett  ing  gratifyingly
smaller. Waterways, again, which were open sewers until the devel-
opment of eff  ective  waste  treatment  at  the  end  of  the  nineteenth
century, are in rich countries largely cleaned up. Levels of particulate
matt er from burning coal for house heating in American cities in
the 1930s and 1940s— American income per person then was, as we
have noted, about the same as Brazilian income now— were com-
parable to those in present- day poor countries and fell by the late
twentieth century to an eighth of their previous level. Mc Closkey
can  remember  in  1948  Boston  windowsills  sooty  by  evening  that
her mother had wiped clean in the morning. In 1912– 1913 a poor and
therefore smoky Chicago was smothered in suspended particulates
half again higher in amount per cubic yard of air than those in fi ft  y-
eight poor Chinese cities during 1980– 1993.

in 1954 and then more rigorously in 1968, the Royal Courts of  Justice
in now- rich London have been scrubbed to return to their original
white stone facing. Litt  le but rich Denmark spends a good deal of its
riches on avoiding carbon- based fuel and is prominent in the world
market in windmills. As Steve Chapman, the liberal columnist at
the Chicago Tribune, reported, “Since 1980, carbon monoxide pollu-
tion in America has been cut by 83 percent, lead by 91 percent, and
sulfur dioxide by 78 percent. But total economic output per person,
adjusted for infl  ation, has risen by 77 percent. We’ve gott  en  greener
and healthier as we’ve gott  en  richer.”
## 6
If you care about the environ-
ment, then, let people become prudently and temperately rich. Th   en
the now richer people can do some good for the environment.
But what about the presently poor countries polluting? Rising
real  income  per  person  at  such  heady  rates  as  7  or  12  percent  per
year, with the level quadrupling in a generation, is understandably
popular with ordinary Chinese and Indian people. But when their
incomes went up, the formerly poor, such as the Danes and the Brit-
ish, we just noted, came to value the environment more. Sometimes,
true,  they  have  valued  it  irrationally,  as  for  example  by  stopping
nuclear power, which has made dirty old coal the fastest- growing
source of energy worldwide. Yet China, bett  ering but still very poor,
now has a vigorous environmental movement— a movement against
coal, not against nuclear power— with numerous riots substituting
for actual democracy. In a nervous response to the movement, and
maybe even because it’s good for people, the Chinese government
in January 2014 said it was going to require fi  ft  een thousand factories
to report their air and water pollution in real time and to release the
results to the public. If they actually do so (don’t hold your breath;
and when visiting Beijing in the winter, do), the Chinese standard
of transparency in controlling pollution will be higher than that of
the United States. Also in 2014, China signed an agreement with the
Obama administration to work seriously on restraining the release
of atmospheric carbon, though Donald Trump took that one down,
among others.
China is now at a stage of industrialization similar to England’s
in the 1870s or the United States’ in the 1890s, during which sulfur-

laden coal smoke rising from Birmingham, Warwickshire, or from
Birmingham, Alabama, was viewed not as an occasion for rioting
but for celebration. In the 1940s, when Mc Closkey’s grandparents
(born in the 1890s) would drive to Chicago around the southern
edge of Lake Michigan, they would note with approval the smoke
rising from US Steel plants in Gary, Indiana— an improvement, they
implied, over the shutt  ered mills of the 1930s.
Oil supply, too, has no long- term limit, as the failures of limits- to-
growth predictions from the 1960s to the present have shown. Th   e
natural scientists making the predictions don’t seem to care that the
evidence runs against them. Worldwide a “peak oil” has yet to hap-
pen, decades aft  er it was confi dently predicted by natural scientists
ignorant of economic science. Th   e paleontologist Niles Eldridge, for
example, as late as 1995 quoted with approval a geologist at Colum-
bia University who had predicted in the 1960s on the basis of “simple
measures of the volumes of the great sedimentary basins” that the
world would run out of recoverable petroleum in the mid- 1990s.
## 7
## Ah,
yes, simple measures. In fact, aft er the 1960s worldwide the proven
oil reserves grew— a miracle unless you realize that “proving” is it-
self an economic activity. World crude- oil production has increased
since 1970 by over 50 percent.
## 8
Fracked gas in Pennsylvania and oil
sands  in  Alberta  and  deep  discoveries  in  the  Falklands/Malvinas
seas and in the Australian outback come from geologists working
to fi  nd more deposits whenever the price of oil rises. And aft  er  such
revisions upward of carbon- fuel reserves, the price of oil corrected
for general infl  ation falls back. Th   at’s how entry works in markets, to
the irritation of the original suppliers and to the joy of consumers.
(One would expect a paleontologist to understand such a process, so
similar to entry into ecological niches; or a geologist to understand
it, so similar to water fi nding its level.) Th  e real price of oil during
the 1990s, when oil was supposed to have run out, was the same as
in the late 1940s.

When episodically the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries was able to make its cartel work to drive down
pumping, the price was jerked upward, as for example in the late

world economic growth. But the price rises were not from nature’s

peak oil so easily predicted by simple measures of the volumes of the

Yet a peculiar rhetorical triumph against nuclear power has wors-
ened global warming. Th   e Green Party in Germany supports lethal
coal over safe nuclear. Th   e rhetoric can be overcome (some reason-
able people have argued) by realizing that even the destruction in
1986 of the Chernobyl reactors, incompetently managed by the So-
viet Union (thus the environmental record of socialism), resulted in
few fatalities— a onetime event of fi  ft  y- six direct fatalities and a few
thousand shortened lives. Lamentable, but two or three orders of
magnitude smaller than the coal- caused deaths in the same region
every year. Th   e disaster of the ill- placed Fukushima nuclear station,
destroyed in 2011 by a tsunami hitt ing Japan, resulted in still fewer
fatalities, and the only big US nuclear problem, in 1979, Th   ree   Mile
Island, none (unless you believe conspiracy theories on the left  ).
According  to  economists  studying  Germany’s  nuclear  phase-  out
in the wake of the Fukushima reactor, “the social cost of this shift
from nuclear to coal [is] approximately 12 billion dollars per year,”
far greater, they argue, than “the costs associated with nuclear ac-
cident risk and waste disposal.” Some 70 percent of the cost, they
argue,  comes  from  higher  mortality  risks  from  fossil  fuel–  related
air pollution.
## 10
Society, that is, can return to an improved nuclear power— or, if
you are optimistic about coal, and resistant to the actual evidence
about nuclear power, and determined to stay spooked about the “one
big disaster,” which French nuclear engineering has solved— you can
wait for clean coal, on which Southern Illinois University is fever-
ishly working.
## 11
(Go Salukis!) Th  e present engineering is anyway
clear. France, with 80 percent nuclear power for its electricity, the
cheapest in Europe, has one- fi  ft  h the carbon pollution of neighbor-
ing, coal- fed- if- green- loving Germany. However you come down on
nuclear power, on what principle is it that, when you see nothing but
bett  erment behind you, are you to expect nothing but deterioration
before you?

In Fact, None of the
## Seven Old Pessimisms
Makes a Lot of Sense
You wouldn’t think the world has changed radically for the bett  er
from the news you hear or the rows of apocalyptic books of fi ction
and  alleged  nonfi  ction  at  your  local  bookstore.  Pessimism  sells,
we have noted, and seven old pessimisms plus three new ones yell
“Naaah!!” at optimistic stories like ours.
But  the  pessimisms  are  fl  at-  earth  versions  of  economics  and
economic  history,  fi  nding  their  way  into  newspaper  op-  eds  and
blog posts, immune to reason and evidence. For example, Charles
Dickens,  contrary  to  popular  belief,  knew  next  to  nothing  about
the Industrial Revolution happening far north of the London of his
novels, and he cannot be considered a guide to economic history.
His vision of poverty was the traditional, nonindustrialized poverty
of London. His one novel of northern industry, in 1854, Hard Times,
was based on a brief, rare visit to the industrializing North of En-
gland. It is muddleheaded in its understanding of industry. Dickens’s
contemporary the historian Th   omas Babington Macaulay called the
book “sullen Socialism.”

Yet most people see his novels as trenchant
criticisms  of  “capitalism.”  Th   e  French  novelist  Honoré  de  Balzac,
likewise, it is said, knew more about French society than any sociolo-
gist. We don’t think so. Like Dickens (and unlike, say, Jane Austen or
Herman Melville or Émile Zola or John Steinbeck or Robert Frost),
he did not trouble to know economics or the economy. Some read-
ers,  likewise,  will  seize  on  the  1848  Communist  Manifesto  of  Karl

Marx and Friedrich Engels. But for all its passion and brilliance, it is
mainly historical and economic fi ction.
Th   e fi  rst old pessimism, of 1798 and 1848, said that the poor were
fated by Malthusian logic to stay poor. Th  e second pessimism, of
1916, said that only Europeans were genetically capable of gett  ing
out  of  $3-  a-  day  poverty.  Th   e  third,  of  1933,  recurring  again  in  the
1970s and 1990s and especially aft er 2008, said that the “fi nal crisis
of capitalism” was at hand. Th   e fourth, of 1945, said that bett  erment
had fi  nished, that stagnation had set in, and that excess saving would
pull incomes down. Th   e   fi   ft h, of 1968, said that anyway (when hu-
manity got out of the non- fi nal crisis and found that technological
stagnation did not in fact happen) a consumerism had corrupted
its soul. Th  e sixth, of 1980, said that the enrichment of the “core”
countries required an army of the exploited in the Global Southern
Periphery.  A  not-  so-  old  seventh  of  the  1990s,  dating  back  to  the
1890s,  said  that  Old  Europe  and  the  United  States  were  doomed
to fall down the league tables as other countries caught up to and
surpassed them in output per person. Th   ey couldn’t “compete.” Th   ey
lacked “dynamism.”
None of these have been fulfi  lled. Not one. Not close.
As for the fi  rst, that the poor will stay poor on Malthusian grounds,
you have seen how poverty around the globe has in fact plummeted.
Growth  has  also  given  the  lie  to  the  second,  the  imperial  and
Eurocentric pessimism. Th  e Great Enrichment since 1916 and es-
pecially since 1980 has gone spectacularly global. Th   e success of the
Asian Tigers and the Celtic and Icelandic ones, and the burgeoning
middle classes in China and India, to say nothing of the success that
non- Europeans have regularly enjoyed when they have moved to
Europe and its off shoots, refutes the claim that only Europeans are
genetically capable of a Great Enrichment. What pessimism and rac-
ism predict, experience refutes.
And so it has been with the third— the half dozen or so claimed
fi  nal crises of capitalism from 1857 to the present. Th   e Great Depres-
sion of the 1930s was made worse, not moderated, by governmental
cures. Aft er the 1930s, as in every one of the forty or so recessions
since 1800, a new historical high in output per person followed. It

has been true also of the Great Recession, too, though the recession
was much less fearsome than the 1930s. Th  e political hangover in
populism  and  socialism  recurs  every  time.  Th   e  system  is  broken.
Down with the system.
Th   e steady march of bett  erment has also given the lie to the fourth
pessimism, of stagnationism— that  bett erment is fi nished and that
excess saving would in a Keynesian logic be a drag on income. Give
Carden a phone call and he’ll comfort you personally about the al-
leged stagnation— a call made cheap by continuing bett  erment  and
by savings implementing non- stagnation in telephoning technology.
Perhaps you and he could set up a FaceTime chat, a Skype or Zoom
call, or a get- together via Google Hangouts, that would allow you
to discuss face- to- face the end of bett  erment and the uselessness of
saving. (Gett  ing the point?)
But aren’t people corrupted by “consumerism,” as per the fi ft  h
pessimism?  True,  they  can  use  liberty  and  prosperity  to  live  like
pigs. Some people do (remember Carden’s disgraceful interest in
professional wrestling)— but again, the bad things people do with
what they have gained from the Bourgeois Deal is not testimony to
the badness of the deal itself. People consumed bad things before
it— bear baiting, for example, or dining on songbirds. As we have
argued at length, you can if you wish keep up with the Kardashians.
But you can also cultivate yourself, as billions do.
“But,”  you  might  say,  drawing  on  the  sixth  pessimism,  “wasn’t
Western  prosperity  ripped  from  the  mouths  of  the  world’s  poor?
Isn’t the West rich because they are poor?” Happily, no. Th   e   Great
Enrichment  occurred  because  of  increased  production  in  (say)
Sweden (and Ireland and Japan and the rest), not increased preda-
tion in the Th   ird World by Sweden (and Ireland and Japan and the
rest). And again, recall that if predation as such could cause a Great
Enrichment, it would have happened millennia ago. Predation is an
ancient human habit.
Mc Closkey was a colleague in the 1970s of Milton Friedman at the
University of Chicago. Friedman (who, you will surely want to know,
shares a birthday with Carden’s older son, and with J. K. Rowling
and  her  Harry  Pott  er,  and  with  their  copy  editor’s  husband),  has

chapter  8
been roundly denounced since the mid- 1970s for his role in what
the left   imagines about “globalization” and “neoliberalism.” A poster
current in 2009 bore Friedman’s visage with the caption, “Milton
Friedman: Proud Father of Global Misery.” Never mind asking why
Friedman, who was a wise and honorable man, would want global
misery. Never mind the astounding economic growth in China—
where reformers were in fact inspired by Friedman’s Capitalism and
Freedom (1962)— that has driven humanity’s largest- ever, and almost
the most rapid, exit from extreme poverty. Some “misery.” With en-
emies like Friedman, do the world’s poor need any statist friends?
Th   e  seventh  pessimism  suggests  that  European  and  American
incomes will fall relative to other societies as the others catch up.
But  so  what?  It’s  good,  not  bad,  that  other  societies  also  become
rich. In the long run, all societies will achieve about the same real
income per person because all will have access to the same recipes
in  technology  and  institutions  created  by  free  people  for  making
goods and services. Th   e global economy is not the Football Associa-
tion’s league table or the World Cup. British observers in the early
nineteenth  century,  like  Americans  in  the  Jazz  Age,  were  startled
at the ease with which the country had taken industrial leadership.
Britain was the fi rst, yet a few of its clerisy were nervously aware of
the oddity of a small island bestriding the world’s economy. Fully
one- third of world iron production in the 1840s came from Britain.
In 1839, early in British success, one James Deacon Hume warned
a committ ee of Parliament that the protectionist British tariff s on
imports of wheat would encourage other countries to move away
from agriculture and toward industry themselves, breaking Britain’s
“domination” of world manufacturing: “We place ourselves at the
risk of being surpassed by the manufactures in other countries. . . . I
can hardly doubt that [when that day arrives] the prosperity of this
country will recede much faster than it has gone forward.”
## 2
Nonsense. It’s the rhetoric of “competitiveness,” and it has always
been nonsense, though a powerful driver of mistaken policies. In the
1840s or the 1990s or nowadays, Britain or the US is made bett  er  off  ,
not worse off , by the industrialization of the rest of the world. You
would  be  made  bett  er  off    by  moving  to  a  neighborhood  of  more

skilled and healthy people willing to trade with you. British growth
has continued from 1840 to the present, making Britons richer and
richer. Likewise, Americans are made bett  er  off   when Japan or China
“defeats” us at car making or TV assembling, or by “stealing our in-
tellectual property,” because “we”— really, individuals making deci-
sions about what to do, and not the collectivist “we” of nationalist
fantasies— then go do something “we” are comparatively good at,
say, banking or growing soybeans. “We” let the Japanese and then
the Koreans and then the Chinese make the consumer electronics.
It’s  not  a  “race”  that  Britain  “lost.”  Th   e  falling  British  share  of
world  markets  was  no  index  of  “failure,”  any  more  than  a  father
would regard his falling share of the poundage in the house relative
to his growing children as a “failure.” It was an index of maturity. So
too for the United States. Th   e purpose of an economy is not exports
(that is, maximum production) but bett  er terms in gett  ing  imports
(maximum consumption). “Jobs” are not what the society should
seek. Goods and services are. In your own life, do you seek to work
more?  If  you  could  get  the  same  consumption  with  less  trouble,
would you? Of course you would. Well, as Adam Smith said, “What
is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly
in that of a great kingdom.”
## 3
“Protecting jobs” is folly.

Th  e seven old pessimisms, appearing and reappearing among the
learned members of the clerisy, only to be refuted again and again by
history and economics, have been joined recently by three new ones:
that environmental decay is an existential threat, that humanity is
being ruined by a new era of inequality, and that technological un-
employment from artifi cial intelligence is the general fate. Th   e   new
pessimisms are likewise misplaced, on evidence we have sketched
earlier. Since 1800, optimism rather than pessimism has been the
wise position.
We have told you why worries about the environment are mis-
placed. A few decades of doomsday prophesying have been coun-
tered  by  Julian  Simon’s  Th   e  Ultimate  Resource  (1981,  1996),  Matt
Ridley’s Th  e Rational Optimist (2010), and Ronald Bailey’s Th   e   End
of Doom (2015) noting that things are in fact gett  ing  bett  er, not worse.
Th   e solution to environmental problems is not a green repackaging
of the central planning beloved of the left  ish clerisy. It is to continue
private, commercially tested bett erment that creates the wealth to
address the problems. Get richer so that more people can have the
luxury of worrying about the environment instead of their next bowl
of  rice.  Look  for  ways  to  encourage  markets  that  signal  property
values aff ected by, say, sea- level rise in Miami. Th  en Miami can do
something about it, including voting against governors who deny
the rise.
What of inequality? Guaranteeing a material equality, note, re-

## 63
quires political inequality, in order to seize Peter’s goods to pay Paul.
It  seems  unlikely  that  this  one  time  the  politicians  will  use  such
powers of coercion in a wise and benevolent fashion. Why would
they?  Th   e  rich  are  paying  them.  And  material  equality  is  not  an
ethically relevant goal. What matt  ers is absolute material standards
of living, not anger that someone else might be doing bett  er.  Ob-
session with inequality walks with the soul- corroding sin of envy.
Envy is insatiable, considering that nearly everyone has something
to envy— as Shakespeare put it in his sonnet 29, “wishing me like
to one more rich in hope, / Featured like him, like him with friends
possessed, / Desiring this man’s art, and that man’s scope, / With
what I most enjoy contented least.” It doesn’t matt er ethically that
an NFL quarterback or a celebrity chef makes millions off  ering  ser-
vices that people are willing to buy voluntarily, for their own good
as consumers. Yet it does very much matt er ethically that there are
still about 10 percent of humans living on less than $1.90 a day. Let’s
take care of that instead of looking enviously at a billionaire’s yacht.
Absolute, not relative, income is what matt  ers  ethically.
## 1
It would be
a mistake, economically and ethically, to expropriate the NFL quar-
terback or celebrity chef or CEO for the benefi  t of the 10 percent of
humans living on less than $1.90 a day, because the rich are not the
cause of $1.90- a- day poverty. Nor do the rich have enough money
to permanently raise up the poor. It is growth, not redistribution,
that saves the poor.
In  any  case,  as  average  incomes  rise,  money  income  becomes
less and less reliable as a measure of the diff erences in the relevant
goods and services available to the rich and to the poor. Million-
aires, and especially billionaires, have limits on how much they can
use incomes so very much higher than yours for correspondingly
unequal consumption— of, say, trousers, put on one leg at a time.
So economic growth, however unequally shared as income, is more
egalitarian  in  its  distribution  of  consumption.  Remember  John
Bates Clark’s one dollar rising to eight for a day’s work. “Such gains
will mean infi nitely more to him,” Clark noted, “than any possible
increase of capital can mean to the rich. . . . Th  is very change will
bring with it a continual approach to equality of genuine comfort.”

Th   e meaningful diff  erences shrink. Today’s Fantine consumes about
$25 a day of goods and services. Dwayne “Th  e Rock” Johnson had
a  2018  pretax  income  of  $124  million,  or  $339,726  a  day,  or  over
thirteen thousand times Fantine’s daily consumption. Does he have
thirteen thousand times as much food? Clothing? Shelter? Scope?
Happiness? Perhaps he has the world’s fi  nest liquor cabinet. Maybe
it includes a $600,000+ bott  le of very old Macallan scotch. Does it
really provide forty thousand times the boozy pleasure Fantine can
enjoy by picking up a $15 twelve- pack of Bud Light on the way home
from work? (She’ll just have one and a half cans herself and invite her
girlfriends in.) During the 1950s, Chock full o’Nuts coff  ee  advertised
itself as “that Heavenly Coff  ee—  Bett  er  coff ee Rockefeller’s money
can’t buy.” Is the very best and most expensive coff  ee or chocolate or
wine or whatever really thousands of times bett  er than what’s avail-
able to the average Fantine? Not in 2020, in places that have allowed
the Bourgeois Deal to work. Or, for that matt  er, anywhere anytime.
And  it  would  be  even  less  of  a  problem  were  we  to  rid  ourselves
of the barriers to entry that prevent widespread and price- lowering
competition and innovation in fi ne chocolate and fi ne whisky.
Nor are the spooky fears of technological unemployment war-
ranted. Bett er techniques make for richer people. It is not “capital-
ism” that people are complaining about when a machinist is made
unemployed by a laser- guided cutt  er. It’s “progress.” Th   e progress, we
have noted six or seven times (are you listening now?), helps mainly
the poor.
True, the usual, generous impulse is to give a hand up to people
unemployed by progress. If a project hurts someone, help them out.
We admire the impulse. Do unto others as you would have them
do unto you. But wait. Every human action is a “project.” If Henry
David Th   oreau invents new methods to make high- quality pencils,
as he did during the 1840s in his father’s business, he harms the less
effi    cient  makers.  If  actual  compensation  is  to  be  paid  to  them,  as
seems only just if it is paid to coal miners in West Virginia and ship-
builders in Le Havre, then every project of every person requires
such payment. Something is wrong.
Th   e  terrifying  phrase  “creative  destruction”  arouses  fears  and

Nor Do the Th   ree New Ones

## 65
spurs proposals for protection. If you really don’t want bett  erment
to happen and don’t want poor people to get rich by the 3,000 per-
cent  that  they  have  in  Japan  and  Finland  and  the  rest  since  1800,
then, fi  ne, the society can stick with the old jobs. It can keep in their
former employment the elevator operator and the telephone opera-
tor, the armies of typists on old mechanical Underwoods, grocery
stores with a clerk in an apron handing you the can of beans over the
counter. But if bett  erment is to happen— as it did with Piggly Wiggly
in Memphis in September 1916 innovating in self- service grocery
stores, or a North Carolina tobacco trucker in 1956 introducing the
shipping container— then people, and also the machines and fac-
tories owned by the bosses, have to lose their old jobs. Human and
physical capital has to reallocate. Of course.
How  much?  Th   e  startling  news,  according  the  Department  of
Labor statistic, is fully 14 percent of jobs per year. In a progressing
economy, one out of every seven workers loses a job slot permanently
every year.
## 3
Businesses go bankrupt. Factories move to another state.
Th   e   offi    ce gets along on fewer typists. By contrast, the monthly labor
reports you hear about on the news give the net fi gure— in a good
month 200,000, or 2,400,000 a year, being the net of new jobs in the
US gained from moving or bett  erment minus the old jobs lost from
the same creative destruction. Th  at’s only 1.5 percent of the labor
force, not 14 percent. But the gross fi gure should be more widely
known. A bett  ering economy requires the workers and the machines
to move, to reallocate, to retrain, to shift , to innovate on a massive
scale. Of course.
So the practical problem with compensation and protection and
schemes of subsidized retraining by government bureaucrats who
do not actually know what the new jobs will be in fi ve years is that
the nation cannot “aff ord” to compensate 14 percent of the work-
force every year. In a few years half the workforce would be on the
dole, or kept in their old jobs at the old pay, or trained in the wrong
new jobs. Soon it would be nearly all of the workforce, compensat-
ing in tax dollars for every human action. For that matt  er, the nation
would also need to keep physical capital where it began, directing
subsidies  to  factories  and  neighborhoods  rather  than  lett  ing    the

## 66

chapter  9
people  and  factories  move,  as  creative  destruction  requires.  And
exactly  the  same  moving  is  required  under  a  perfectly  planned
socialism  as  under  commercially  tested  bett  erment.  It’s  progress,
whether ordered by a commissar or tested in a market. Carried out
with philosophical consistency, protection would require us to keep
shoe  manufacturing  in  Massachusett  s  as  much  as  coal  mining  in
southern Illinois, economy- wide, forever. As we said, something is
wrong, with plans to guarantee jobs or compensate for technologi-
cal unemployment or keep capital and labor in Youngstown, Ohio.
“But artifi  cial intelligence is diff  erent,” you say. “Stupid technolo-
gies like railways replaced sweat and manual labor. Smart technolo-
gies are going to replace problem solving and mind work. My work.”
But we’ve been relying on “artifi cial intelligence” for thousands of
years. Th   e bow and arrow is a machine for calculating automatically
the accurate throwing of a litt  le spear. Th   e intelligence is in the bow,
then in the practice, practice that makes archers at Agincourt act like
machines. Th   e safety valve on a steam engine replaced the exercise
of human judgment in lett  ing  off  steam. Th  e adding machine and
the slide rule, to say nothing of the pocket calculator, are machines
of artifi cial intelligence. A “computer,” as in the Manhatt  an  Project
building  the  A-  bomb,  was  originally  a  woman  who  sat  in  a  room
adding up long columns of fi gures. Typists were largely rendered
obsolete in the late twentieth century and travel agents in the early
twenty- fi  rst by the diff  usion of the personal computer and its result,
the internet. Online travel websites like Expedia and Kayak use “ar-
tifi  cial intelligence” to do what non- artifi  cial intelligence used to do.
Artifi cial intelligence has similar creative/destructive potential. As
the economic historian Joel Mokyr puts it, “artifi cial intelligence,
the source of much concern that it will replace educated knowledge
workers  and  not  just  routinized  jobs,  could  become  the  world’s
most eff ective research assistant, even if it will never become the
world’s best researcher.”
## 4
Yes, we realize that AI is self- learning. But
like Mokyr, we think self- learning machines will merely help non-
machines called humans to stop having to imitate machines.
Or  you  can  choose  to  reject  improvements  in  AI.  In  Berkeley
Breathed’s “Bloom County” comic strip, the character Steve Dallas

## 67
speaks of “a special fund- raising concert I’m organizing to benefi t a
troubled industry.” He then pounds the table, exclaiming, “A whole
American way of life is disappearing because the govt. won’t help
out!!”
## 5
Th   e  concert?  “Slide-  Rule  Aid.”  Th   e  world  would  not  be
richer had a law saved the slide rule industry from another technol-
ogy of artifi cial intelligence. (Mc Closkey, who was raised on slide
rules, however, would have gladly att ended Dallas’s concert. Slide
rules for multiplication, she points out, forced engineers and even
economists to att  end to the order of magnitude at every step because
otherwise they would get the decimal place wrong by a factor of ten
or a hundred. Nowadays kids don’t think in magnitudes, accepting
whatever comes out of a calculator or statistical soft  ware  package—
despite the inherent risk of garbage in, garbage out. Not all progress
is entirely progressive.)

To overcome unjustifi ed pessimism, we’re saying, it’s smart to get
the facts straight and then to think about ethics.
If  the  world  does  so  and  embraces  the  liberal  Bourgeois  Deal,
then an even Greater Enrichment opens up, completing the task of
making poverty history. Th   e Bourgeois Era did not thrust aside, as
claimed by the left  ish American historian Charles G. Sellers rhapso-
dizing in 1991 about the world we have lost, lives “of enduring human
values of family, trust, cooperation, love, and equality.”
## 1
Good lives
such as these are lived now. John Kumalo’s chief back in the village
enforced the traditional society’s enduring human values of an op-
pressive family, narrow trust, coerced cooperation, exclusive love,
and enforced equality— and incidentally his own interests and his
own arbitrary will.
We are not suggesting that every single thing about the bourgeois
world is hunky dory or that everything the bourgeoisie does is Good
and Right and Ethical. Many a businessperson is an ethical shell or
worse. But the same is true of many a politician or professor or priest
or an old and ignorant ruler of a traditional village in South Africa,
or the congregation and the planter in Sellers’s vision of colonial and
early national America.
In a collection of mini essays asking “Does the Free Market Cor-
rode Moral Character?” the political philosopher Michael Walzer
replied, “Of course it does.” But then he wisely added that any social
system can corrode one or another virtue. Th  at the Bourgeois Era

has tempted people into thinking that greed is good, wrote Walzer,
“isn’t  itself  an  argument  against  the  free  market.  Th   ink   about   the
ways democratic politics also corrodes moral character. Competi-
tion for political power puts people under great pressure . . . to shout
lies at public meeting, to make promises they can’t keep.”
## 2
## Witness
the  presidential  campaigns  in  the  United  States  in  2016  or  2020.
Fallen humans are like that. Or think about the ways even a mild
socialism puts people under great pressure to commit the sins of
state- enforced envy or class hatred or environmental imprudence.
Or think about the ways, before Sellers’s alleged “commercial revo-
lution” in the early United States, that his alleged “aff ective and al-
truistic relations of social reproduction in traditional societies” put
women under great pressure to obey their husbands in all things and
encouraged people to hang troublesome Quakers and Anabaptists,
and more recently to refuse service to Willie Mays on account of
his skin color.
Th   at  is  to  say,  any  social  system,  if  it  is  not  to  dissolve  into  a
Hobbesian  war  of  all  against  all,  needs  ethics  adopted  by  its  par-
ticipants. It must have some device— preaching, songs, movies, the
press, child raising, or in a pinch the state, as in Prohibition— to slow
down the corrosion of moral character, at any rate by the standard
the society adopts. Th   e Bourgeois Era has in many ways set a higher
social standard than others, we have noted, abolishing slavery and
giving votes to women and the poor. For further progress, Walzer
the communitarian puts his trust in an old conservative argument—
namely, an ethical education arising from well- intentioned laws en-
forced by the police. One might doubt that a state strong enough to
enforce such laws would remain uncorrupted for long. Look at the
results of Prohibition.
Th   e   mott o of the Buddenbrooks family in Th  omas Mann’s 1901
novel about his northern German grain- merchant family was “My
son, att end with zeal to thy business by day; but do none that hin-
ders thee from thy sleep at night.”
## 3
It is the bourgeois’ pride to be
“a fair- dealing merchant,” with “quiet, tenacious industry,” to “make
concessions and show consideration,” to have “assured and elegant
bearing, . . . tact and winning manners,” a “liberal, tolerant strain,”

## 70

chapter  10
with “sociability and ease, and . . . remarkable power of decision at a
division” in the town assembly, “a man of action,” making “quick deci-
sion upon the advantageous course,” “a strong and practical- minded
man, with defi nite impulses aft er power and conquest,” but by no
evil means.
## 4
“Men walked the streets proud of their irreproachable
reputation as business men.”
## 5
Is it so evil to hope that “one can be a
great man, even in a small place; a Caesar even in a litt  le  commercial
town on the Baltic”? We think not. What is wrong with “the dream
of preserving an ancient name, an old family, an old business”?
## 6
## Not
much, at any rate by comparison with the blood spilled by aristocrats
defending a nine- hundred- year- old name, or the blood spilled by the
clerisy- in- charge inspiring and then leading mass slaughters during
the twentieth century. On the contrary, preserving by continuous
bett erment a business of making mutually advantageous trades is
good for the rest of us, the Bourgeois Deal.
Contrary to a common opinion since 1848, that is, the arrival of
a  bourgeois,  business-  respecting  civilization  did  not  corrupt  the
human  spirit,  despite  temptations.  Mostly,  in  fact,  it  elevated  it.
Walzer is right to complain in the same essay that “the arrogance of
the economic elite these last few decades has been astonishing.” So
it has. But the arrogance comes from the silly theory that greed is
good, not from the moralized economy of exchange that Smith and
John Stuart Mill and Milton Friedman saw around them and which
continues even now to spread.
Modern Christianity and modern socialism both are mistaken to
contrast a rural Eden to a corrupted City of Man. William Cowper,
the popular poet of the sentimental revolution in Britain in the late
eighteenth century, expressed in 1785 a cliché dating back to ancient
Greece: “Th  e town has ting’d the country; and the stain /Appears
a spot upon a vestal’s robe, / Th  e worse for what it soils.”
## 7
No. Th   e
urban, bourgeois world here below is not a utopia. But neither is it,
we have argued, anything like the opposite. Th  e specifi cally bour-
geois world should not be judged a hell by a sneering and historically
uninformed defi nition of bourgeois. Th  e judgment should depend
on factual inquiry and not on ignorant clichés about economics and
history, in the illiberal politics of left   and right and middle.

Businesspeople, in any case, compare favorably to people in other
professions when it comes to, for example, honesty. Obviously, if a
businessperson gets caught lying, it costs him or her in customers
and colleagues. Compare the low costs to pundits and politicians
when they shout lies at public meetings. Lying is hardly unique to
business. In other words, the moral failings of the bourgeois are be-
cause they are businesspeople, not because they are businesspeople.

Perfect? Never, but as the political scientist we keep mentioning,
John Mueller, put it in a prett  y good (well . . . very good) book in

Keillor’s imagined Lake Wobegon, Minnesota.

Compare the French
baron Montesquieu in 1748, an early liberal, noting, “Commercial
laws, it may be said, improve manners for the same reason that they
destroy them. Th   ey corrupt the purest morals. Th   is was the subject of
Plato’s complaints; and we every day see that they polish and refi  ne the
most barbarous” (emphasis added).
## 10
We doubt his “purest,” if purity
is imagined to be achieved by aristocratic and Homeric slaughter.
And we do not recommend Plato’s aristocratic sneers against trade
and democracy. But yes, markets polish and refi ne.
## §
We are claiming that the Bourgeois Era has not been the worst in
ethical practice. And we are recommending carrying on with an ethi-
cal market economy— neither an unethical social Darwinism push-
ing the poor off   the road nor an unethical authoritarianism pushing
them back along the road to serfdom and poverty. An ethical market
economy, we further claim, has been best achieved not by industrial
policy from Paris or Washington but by a free society, one with no
masters: modern liberalism.
Consider. Ethics has three levels: the good for self, the good for
others,  and  the  good  for  the  transcendent  purpose  of  a  life.  Th   e
good for self is the prudence by which you self- cultivate, learning
to play the cello, say, or practicing centering prayer. Self- denial is
therefore not automatically virtuous. As God’s creature, you owe
improvement to yourself. (How many self- denying mothers does it

take to change a lightbulb? None: I’ll just sit here in the dark.) Th   e
good for a transcendent purpose— at the top, so to speak, of ethical
behavior— is the faith, hope, and love to pursue an answer to the
question “So what?” Th  e family, science, art, the football club, and
God give the answers that humans seek.
Th   e middle level is att  ention to the good for others. Th   e late fi  rst-
century BCE Jewish sage Hillel of Babylon put it negatively: “Do
not do unto others what you would not want done unto yourself.”
It’s masculine, a guy- liberalism, a gospel of justice, roughly the so-
called Non- Aggression Axiom as articulated by libertarians since the
word libertarian was redirected in the 1950s to a (then) right- wing
liberalism. Matt   Kibbe puts it well in the title of his 2014 best seller,
Don’t Hurt People and Don’t Take Th   eir Stuff  : A Libertarian Manifesto.
On the other hand, the early fi rst- century CE Jewish sage Jesus of
Nazareth put it positively: “Do unto others as you would have them
do unto you.” It’s gal- liberalism, a gospel of love, placing upon us an
ethical responsibility to do more than pass by on the other side. Be

In treating others, a humane liberalism att ends to both Golden
Rules. Th  e one corrects a busybody and coercive pushing around.
Th   e  other  corrects  an  inhumane  and  soul- destroying  selfi  shness.
Together they are the other- ethics of modern liberalism. What the
world does not need is the social Darwinist or authoritarian version,
the old spoof of the Golden Rule— namely, “Th  ose who have the
gold, rule.” Nor does the world need to follow the Florida football
player on the eve of the Florida– Florida State game, “I follow the
Good Book: ‘Do unto others before they do it unto you.’” Neither
is nonaggressive or nice.
Th   e Golden Rule in either formulation, note, is radically egalitar-
ian. In the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam,
you  are  to  treat  every  human  soul  the  way  you  would  wish  to  be
treated. You are to honor your one God and keep God’s day holy,
but  the  rest  of  the  Ten  Commandments  are  about  treating  other
humans as you would wish to be treated in matt ers such as truth
telling or adultery. By contrast, in the theism of the Hindus or in the

civic religion of the Confucians, you are to treat the Brahman and
the  emperor  as  superior  souls.  An  untouchable  or  a  peasant  or  a
woman or a younger son is not to expect equal, reciprocal treatment.
Of course, it was not until the bourgeois societies of late eighteenth-
century Europe that anyone but an early Christian radical or a late
Muslim saint thought to carry out in any large society the sweetly
other-  regarding  theory  of  Abrahamic  egalitarianism.  Until  Tom
Paine or Adam Smith, a duchess was still a duchess, a sultan still a
sultan, King Herod still Great.
Th   e double Golden Rules should govern thinking about how to
treat  others.  People  should  be  prudent  and  just  but  also  prudent
and loving. A free economy encourages both. A non- free economy
violates  one  or  the  other.  Consider,  for  example,  the  policies  of
subsidy, protection, prohibition, industrial policy, and a hand up to
those unemployed by progress. When they are not merely payoff s
to favored interest groups, which is lamentably common, they might
satisfy Jesus. But in their seizure of Paul’s goods to help Peter, they
massively off end Hillel. Not good. Humans need a temperate bal-
ance of love and justice, female and male.
Th  e intemperate application of the Jesus principle in economic
“protection,”  we  say,  violates  the  Hillel  principle.  Economically
speaking, people are not islands, entire of themselves. Each person
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. Th  at is to say, every
person’s action to buy or not buy, to off er for sale or not, to enter a
trade or not, to invent or not, aff ects someone else for bett  er or for
worse. If “protected,” everyone becomes everyone else’s slave. As
the economist Donald Boudreaux puts it, “What no person is free
to  do  is  to  oblige  others  to  subsidize  his  or  her  choices.  I,  for  ex-
ample, should be free to work as a poet but not empowered to force
you either directly to buy my poetry or to obstruct your freedom to
spend your money on mystery novels, movies, and other items that
compete with my poetry.”

“But there is more to life than wealth,” you will say. Yes, of course.
Only a Shallow Hal regards his worth as his income, or his life as the
pursuit of toys, though Carden is especially grateful for his income

of the manuscript back to Mc Closkey (we wonder: would Michael
Sandel and other philosophers of the limits to markets consider this
blameworthy line jumping?). Our students in college will declare

Materialism,  true,  is  a  danger  to  the  soul.  Th   e  economist  and
demographic historian Richard Easterlin warned in 1974 that “eco-
nomic growth is a carrier of a material culture of its own that ensures
that humankind is forever ensnared in the pursuit of more and more
economic goods.”
## 1
But wait a minute. Admitt edly, humans are “ensnared,” even en-
slaved,  by  toys.  Social  science  in  the  twentieth  century,  however,
has discovered an important if partial reply: any level of income is a
“carrier of a material culture,” $3 a day as much as $130 a day. As East-
erlin said, “forever.” Th   e anthropologists and psychologists point out

that any meal taking or shelter building or tale telling “ensnares” its
people, the Bushmen of the Kalahari no less than the fl  oor traders of
Wall Street. Humans make themselves with consumption, as the an-
thropologists observe. Th   e anthropologists Mary Douglas and Baron
Isherwood put it so: “Goods that minister to physical needs— food
and drink— are no less carriers of meaning than ballet or poetry. Let
us put an end to the widespread and misleading distinction between
goods that sustain life and health and others that service the mind
and heart— spiritual goods.”

Or as the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins put it in
a new preface to his classic of 1972, Stone Age Economics, “economic
activity . . . [is] the expression, in a material register, of the values and
relations of a particular form of life.”
## 5
Easterlin urges “us” to resist consumerism and become “masters
of  growth.”
## 6
One  wants  to  be  wary  of  such  urgings  that  “we”  do
something, because the “we” is so easily corrupted— for instance,
by  a  rabid  nationalism  or  by  the  mere  snobbery  of  the  rich  and
educated. But surely in an ethical sense, he is right. “We” need to
persuade one another to take advantage of the Great Enrichment
for something other than keeping up with the Kardashians and eat-
ing more chips and strutt  ing about in a world of status- confi rming
consumption, gold toilets and all. People are ensnared, admitt  edly,
as all their ancestors were back to the caves. In modern conditions
of wide material scope, however, one can hope that the ensnaring
would oft  en be worthy of the best versions of humanness, ensnared
by Bach or by the celebration of the Mass or (says Mc Closkey) by a
test match for the Ashes at Lord’s on a perfect London day in June.
Such advice, to be nobly ensnared, has been a commonplace since
the invention of religion and literature, or back to the coyote tales
around the Native American campfi re. It has nothing much to do
with the Great Enrichment and its alleged “consumerism”— except
that thanks to the Enrichment a vastly larger percentage of humanity

## 77
is open to the advice. Th   e clerisy thinks that other people’s spending
is just awful— even good economists partake in the clerisy’s disdain.
Th   e cultural historian Daniel Horowitz argued persuasively that “at
the heart of most versions of modern moralism is a critique, some-
times radical and always adversarial, of the economy. . . . Denounc-
ing other people for their profl igacy and lack of Culture is a way of
reaffi    rming one’s own commitment.”
## 7
Th   e clerisy, that is, dislikes the consumption of the commoners.
Especially in the United States, for instance, the clerisy has been say-
ing for a century that the naive commoners are in the grips of a tiny
group of advertisers. So the spending on sodas and gas grills and au-
tomobiles is the result of hidden persuasion or, to use a favorite word
of the clerisy to describe commercial free speech, “manipulation.”
Th   e  peculiarly  American  att  ribution  of  gigantic  power  to  thirty-
second television spots is puzzling to an economist. If advertising
had the powers att  ributed to it by the clerisy, then unlimited fortunes
could be had for the writing. Yet advertising is less than 2 percent of
GDP, much of it uncontroversially informative— such as shop signs
and or ads in trade magazines aimed at highly sophisticated buyers.
Easterlin makes another economist’s point, that “how people feel
they ought to live . . . rises commensurately with income. Th   e   result
is that while income growth makes it possible for people bett  er  to
att ain their aspirations, they are not happier because their aspira-
tions, too, have risen.”
## 8
Some other economists, especially from the
left  or center, agree that standards of consumption are social, and
so higher income is spent in an arms race to match other people’s
consumption— expensive leather furniture in one’s pied- à- terre in
New York City, say— because that is How Good People Live Now.
Well,  what  of  it?  More  and  more  humans  are  richer,  and  soon
all  of  them.  Th   erefore,  they  have  an  expanded  idea  of  how  many
square feet a livable apartment must be. Th  ey have more scope for
painting themselves in more comfortable, sometimes elevated, ways.
Good. Th   e “happiness” literature among economists is predisposed
to fi nd modern levels of consumption vulgar and corrupting, that
arms race.

It has become one of the scientifi c legs of the century-
old campaign by the clerisy against the “consumerism” to which the

nonclerisy is so wretchedly enslaved, as described in the writings of
the economists Fred Hirsch or Robert Frank or Tibor Scitovsky, or
the sociologist Juliet Schor, or indeed the sociological economist of
a century ago, the great Th   orstein   Veblen.
In her survey of Catholic and radical thinking on consumption,
the theologian Christine Firer Hinze worries that such self- makings
in consumption might abandon human virtues, especially the vir-
tue of temperance. She recalls Monsignor John A. Ryan’s books of
economics in the early twentieth century calculating the costs of
dignity as against superfl uity. Hinze and Mc Closkey agree with the
anti- consumption clerisy that it is possible to make oneself badly—
she and Mc Closkey are Aristotelians and Aquinians, with an idea of
the virtuous life. We are not utilitarians refusing to judge consump-
tion. Th   e economists can be properly criticized for such a species of
amoralism, which from the 1980s onward corrupted, we have noted,
American schools of business. “Structures of sin” are possible in the
sociology  of  consumption.  Hinze  and  Mc  Closkey  would  urge  “a
virtue approach to consumer culture,” and to much else. But what
evidence, really, is there that “the market can neither generate nor
guarantee respect for . . . moral foundations”?
## 10
Doubtless not with-
out ethical eff  ort, yes. But “cannot”?
Th   e proper story, that is, praises the system people refer to when
they use the word capitalism. Th   e word itself, though, is oft  en  used
to mean unmitigated greed, profi ts over people— that is, whatever
advances the interests of the owners of capital, sin incarnate. In her
2006 book Th   e   Bourgeois   Virtues, Mc Closkey defi nes capitalism as
“private property and free labor without central planning, regulated
by the rule of law and an ethical consensus.”
## 11
But later she realized
that the defi nition is too static and does not embrace a liberal ap-
proval of commercially tested bett  erment.  Th   e   bett  er ethical system
is that of liberal innovism. It turns proper att  ention  to  new,  mass
creativity and the new, mass liberty to devise or relocate, starting in
northwestern Europe and now rapidly enriching the world. Liberal
innovism should not be silently assumed without evidence to be
corrupting. Stop to consider.

came under revolutionary scrutiny in 1848, initiating a slow turn to
socialism.  Innovism  and  liberalism  were  almost  destroyed  in  the
twentieth  century,  especially  during  Europe’s  seventy-  fi  ve-  year-
long suicide att  empt (1914– 1989), during which such antibourgeois
notions as nationalism and socialism and (God help us) national
socialism “tore the lid off   of hell.”

Th   e Great Enrichment survived.
Bett  er keep it, for a dignifi ed and ethical life for humans.



So what caused it? Our friends on the moderate right of the political
spectrum extoll the “Killer Apps,” as the Tory historian Niall (pro-
nounced like “Neal”) Ferguson calls them. His list is: bett  er  prop-
erty rights, a work ethic, a consumer society, competition, modern
medicine, and science.
## 1
We agree that any decent society should want more of these. But
we disagree that they are the “killer apps” explaining why people in
some places are very rich while people in other places are very poor.
Property rights are surely necessary. A society without them will not
enrich, as Hobbes so eloquently asserted. But good property rights,
which by the way do not require a leviathan, have existed in every
society— or else it is not a society but a war of all against all. Th   e
classic of English legal history by Pollock and Maitland (1895, mainly
by Maitland) showed that the English laws of property and contract
were largely formed, as the book’s title puts it, “before the time of
Edward I.” Th  at’s 1272. Th  e economist Bart Wilson argues persua-
sively that the fi rst person who made a spear out of a haft  and glue
and twine and a stone point and called it “mine” made Homo sapiens
into a property owner and a trader.
## 2
Property rights in ancient Rome
and medieval China were as good as in eighteenth- century Scotland.
Yet the Scots, not the Chinese, made the modern world. Property
is not a suffi  ciency.
Necessary? Sure. But property was commonplace and therefore
hardly a candidate for a killer app peculiar to the modern European
world. Anyway, as a matt er of logic, necessary is not suffi    cient.  To

claim,  as  did  Douglass  North  (Nobel  1993,  but  not  for  this),  that
bett er property rights caused economic development is like saying
that oxygen in the atmosphere caused the Great Chicago Fire of 1871
or that the English language caused the novels of Jane Austen from
1811 to 1818. Necessary? Sure. Suffi    cient? Of course not.
Th   e  other  Ferguson  apps  are  likewise  not  suffi  cient,  merely
sometimes necessary, and are decidedly not killer. As to a work ethic
and a consumer society, when have poor agriculturists not worked
hard, and when have humans not eagerly consumed what they had?
Ferguson’s “competition” in markets characterized China from the
T’ang Dynasty at the latest down to the last emperor, with a large
national extent of markets and with light taxation and with centuries
of peace— more competition than in the insanely quarrelsome and
fragmented Europe since the fall of Rome.
And  modern  medicine  and  “science”  came  fr  om  enrichment
more than causing it. Sewers in enriching countries, based mainly
in the nineteenth century on a nonbacterial understanding of the
transmission of disease, for example, brought Europe up to the old
standard of urban healthiness in China. And high science had litt  le
to do with most of modern growth until 1900 or so, and really sig-
nifi  cantly only aft  er 1945. Penicillin, discovered in the 1930s, was not
released for civilian use until aft  er World War II. Mc Closkey in 1943
spent a month in the hospital aft er chewing on the business end of
an extension cord. Th   e only antibiotic available was a sulfa drug, also
a recent scientifi  c discovery, though the correct dosage for an infant
was not known. It stopped infection from the lip surgery entailed, for
which heartfelt thanks, but damaged the kidneys some. You hear the
combination “scienceandtechnology” a good deal, especially from
physical and biological scientists wanting more of your money for
their  noble  undertakings.  But  most  of  the  world’s  welfare  comes
from the technology part, not from high- energy physics or space
probes to Saturn and the High Frontier.

Our friends on the left  , by contrast, say that the West waxed rich by
stealing from the rest, by enslaving them and building empires. But,

## 85
as Ferguson correctly notes, imperial exploitation is the least original
thing the Europeans did aft er 1492. Slavery and empires have been
commonplace yet never produced a Great Enrichment. Th   e   slave
trade along the east coast of Africa, sending black slaves (like the
white Slavs of the north, hence “slave”) into the markets of Cairo
and Constantinople/Istanbul was of longer duration and was on the
same scale as that from the west coast, which is supposed to have
made the United States rich. Yet the eastern trade didn’t make Egypt
or the Byzantine or Ott  oman Empires rich, not on even close to the
scale of the Great Enrichment. Similarly, for some reason Brazil and
the Caribbean, with much larger imports of west African slaves than
the remote United States, did not share in the magically enriching
power of slavery.
Nor empire. Th   e economist Lance Davis and the historian Robert
Hutt  enbach showed decisively long ago that even the vaunted British
Empire, on which the sun never set, was a drain on British income.
## 3

Benjamin Disraeli, before his 1872 conversion to imperialism, had
in 1852 complained that “these wretched colonies . . . are a millstone
around  our  neck.”  He  was  right  in  1852  and  wrong  in  1872.  A  few
British mining fortunes were made, a few viceroys of India educated
at Christ Church College, Oxford, got their portraits up on the walls
of the Senior Common Room, and quite a few twits from minor pub-
lic schools got jobs in the empire, with billiards and gin- and- tonics
nightly at the club. But the ordinary Scot or Cockney or Yorkshire-
man got nothing but the great joy of seeing, by jingo, a quarter of the
globe painted red. Th   e poor sods paid taxes on beer and tobacco to
support the Royal Navy and then died on the Northwest Frontier in
1880 or on the western front in 1916 or in the Burmese jungles in 1943.
No, this or that right- wing app or left  - wing exploitation can’t do it.
Some few of them increased income in Europe and then the world, a
litt  le bit. Consider the tea trade with China (but the Opium Wars).
Consider organic chemistry (but poison gas). Canals. Savings banks.
One- room schoolhouses. But each had by itself a small eff  ect  relative
to the 3,000 percent per person to be explained, and many of them
had  been  anticipated  elsewhere,  without  the  massive  eff  ect—  in
1492, for example, the Chinese were more literate and had in their
past been much more inventive than the Europeans.

Deeper tides of explanation are in order. Improvements of 1 or 2 per-
cent in an industry taking 1 percent or even 10 percent of the nation’s
inputs are nice to have— you would get along just fi ne with, say, a
mere  1/2,300th  of  US  national  income  ($8.6  billion  a  year,  thank
you very much; it is the modern equivalent of what Robert Clive,
the British conqueror of India, enjoyed in each of the seven years
he  lived  aft  er  his  return  in  1757).
## 4
But  a  great-  invention  theory  of
economic history doesn’t work even as well as a great- man theory
of political history. As many as twenty net 2- percenters— big deals
such as the railway or the high school movement— don’t add up to
the massive 1,000 to 10,000 percent rise over the miserable level of
income per person in 1800. Or to put it another way, the tidal wave
of  ingenious  apps  aft  er  1800  does  add  up—  but  then  it  is  the  tidal
wave, not the steam engine or the internet or agronomical research
on hybrid corn, that is the real explanation. It’s the wave, not this or
that molecule of water.
What, then, caused the tidal wave of ingenuity?
We  argue,  with  solid  support  in  recent  research  in  economics
and in history, that the British got rich— and then Westerners and
then much of world, and all humans in the next few generations—
because of a change in ethics and rhetoric and ideology.
Strange, yes? Mere ideas, not matt  er. But the more you think about
it, the more obvious it becomes. New ideas, understood as human
intentions, precede new actions. Routine profi  t or routine exploita-
tion can’t make you or your world rich. It has to be a new idea that
raises everyone’s game, and there need to be thousands of them. Th   e
source of the wave of molecules, we claim, was the new permission
to have a go, inspired by the shocking new ethics and rhetoric and
ideology of liberalism. Give ordinary folk the right to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness— against ancient tyranny (and modern
regulation, industrial planning, and occupational licensure)— and
they commence thinking up all manner of new ideas. Th   ey   think
up an ice cream store here, a frontier farm there, an iPhone at last.

the  gears  of  the  watch—  necessary  but  not  the  motive  force.  Th   e
spring  in  the  mechanical  watch  of  modern  bett  erment  was  ideas,
inspired by the master idea of free human equality of permission,
liberalism. People started in the new liberalism— imagined during
the  eighteenth  century  and  slowly  and  imperfectly  implemented
thereaft  er— to talk diff  erently about one another. Equality of stand-
ing and of permission and of legal rights became the ruling theory,
against the hierarchy in all previous times (and, we worry, the new
hierarchy of governmental domination in present times).
Th   e previous rhetoric, echoes of which you still hear, is that of a
jailer in southern France during the thirteenth century scorning a
rich man’s plea for mercy: “Come, Master Arnaud Teisseire, you have
wallowed in such opulence! . . . How could you be without sin?”

at length the advanced thinkers such as Adam Smith and Th   omas
Paine came to believe the Bourgeois Deal.
A  bumper  sticker  version  of  evolutionary  biology  is  “descent
with  modifi  cation.”  Th   e  Great  Enrichment  happened  because
people embraced dissent with modifi cation. Th  ey started to honor
dissenters — or at least stopped hanging and burning them. Samuel
Johnson never indulged in the antieconomic, anticonsumerist, anti-
profi  t yammering so common among the later clerisy and common
among the aristocracy and the literal clerics of his times. In 1753, he
praised innovation, well before the very word had gained its modern
prestige— “Th   e age is running mad aft  er innovation; all the business
of the world is to be done in a new way; men are to be hanged in a
new way”— and took an informed interest in new ways of, say, brew-
ing. He defended hopeful projectors:
Th   at the att  empts of such men will oft  en miscarry, we may reason-
ably expect; yet from such men, and such only, are we to hope for
the cultivation of those parts of nature which lie yet waste, and

His was a declaration against the enemies of the bourgeois dignity
and liberty to improve. Such a declaration would have been nearly
impossible in 1620— although Francis Bacon, for all his aristocratic
nastiness, was at the time an early robin in that spring. Th   e   American
projector Benjamin Franklin, about the same time as Johnson, wrote
to similar eff  ect, with an uncharacteristic bitt  erness: the att  empts  of
an improver such as himself “to benefi t mankind, . . . however well
imagined, if they do not succeed expose him, though very unjustly,
to general ridicule and contempt; and if they do succeed, to envy,
robbery, and abuse.”

As the German sociologist Max Weber pointed
out in 1904, the arrival of the creative destroyer “was not generally

indignation, regularly opposed itself to the fi  rst innovator.”

But then
people began to att ribute the trader’s profi t to ingenuity and alert-

(“How could you be without sin?”).

We’ve been calling the new idea coming out of liberal equality of
people innovism, which is a scientifi cally more accurate word than
the misleading capitalism. Capitalism is what the Dutch call a “beg-
gar name”— a name assigned by one’s sneering enemies, such as the
words Quaker  or  To r y  or  Whig,  but  then  adopted  proudly  by  the
victims themselves. Th   us   “Forbes: Capitalist Tool.”
Th   e   word   capitalism is a Marxist coinage. Karl Marx himself never
used  the  word  Kapitalismus,  but  let’s  not  get  pedantic.  He  freely
tossed around capitalist to describe the bosses who were busily rein-
vesting surplus value on top of their original accumulation of capital.
In older usage, capitalist meant merely someone with a lot of money
to invest. Marx gave the word its theoretical edge. Like economists
and others before and aft  er, Marx claimed that the accumulation of
capital was the watch spring of modernity.
And so by using the word, one adopts without realizing it a par-
ticular theory of how the world got rich: by accumulation. Which
is  mistaken.  Th   e  Marxian  sociologist  Immanuel  Wallerstein,  for
example,  wrote  in  1983  that  “the  word  capitalism  is  derived  from
capital. It would be legitimate therefore to presume that capital is a
key element in capitalism.”
## 1
No, it wouldn’t. So, since the fi rst part
of the word astrology is derived from the Latin for “star,” it would be
legitimate to presume that stars are a key element in human fate. Th   at
people insist on ruminating on something called “capital” does not
imply that its accumulation was in fact unique to modernity.

And it was not. Romans and Chinese and all human beings back
to the caves have always accumulated capital, abstaining from con-
sumption to get it. Sheer accumulation, without new ideas, runs up
against sharply diminishing returns. Without a new idea for a pizza
joint— new in its location or new in its product— adding at great
expense another to the corner of Polk and Dearborn, crowding into
the half dozen already within a couple of blocks, is a stupid project,
privately and socially.
What  made  us  rich  were  good  new  ideas  for  investing  capital,
directing labor, marshalling land, not the investments themselves,
necessary though they were. Mc Closkey got into a litt  le debate about
the matt er with her liberal friend Mark Skousen. (Th  e debate hap-
pened at the amazing FreedomFest conference every August in Las
Vegas,  which  Mark  hosts.  It’s  a  hoot.  Go.)  Mark  voiced  a  typical
objection to our view that ideas, not capital, were the springs in the
watch. “You must have capital to advance the economy,” he said to
Mc Closkey. “Entrepreneurs have plenty of great ideas and budding
technology to change the world, but unless they get fi  nancing, they
will remain unfulfi  lled.”
Th  at’s right, but as Skousen admitt ed, the fi nancing is merely a
necessary condition, not a suffi    cient  one.  Th   e explosion of human in-
genuity aft  er 1800, by contrast, was suffi    cient.  Th   e ideas for railways
and electric lights and containerization were so good that fi  nancing
was seldom a problem. (How does “never” work for you?)
What happened aft  er the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 is a decisive
test. One- third of the city burned down. But, immediately, the week
aft er, with the embers still warm in the wrecked buildings, entre-
preneurs at all levels started rebuilding the city, this time in brick
and stone instead of wood. Th   ey dumped the rubbish from the fi re
into the adjacent Lake Michigan, extending the shoreline a quarter
mile. Th   ey   att  racted architects from all over and invented steel- frame
skyscrapers. In a few years Chicago was back, bragging so much that
an out- of- town journalist named it “the Windy City,” a beggar name
that stuck, to this day misleading people about Chicago weather: the
winds off  the lake moderate the temperature, warming it in winter
and cooling it in summer.

Why did they rebuild so fast and so high and so arrogantly? Be-
cause the location of Chicago was an idea superior to Milwaukee
or Saint Louis. Th  e idea made reinvestment in the city immensely
profi  table, instantly. And so for decades Chicago, despite notorious
corruption  at  every  level  of  government,  was  among  the  fastest-
growing cities in the world, the Shenzhen of America. A site at the
lowest portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River
system, reinforced by its equally natural but politically assured cen-
ter of the nation’s railway system (“freight handler for the nation”;
thank you, Abe Lincoln, att orney for the Illinois Central Railway)
caused the investment. Th  e investment did not cause the site. Th   e
idea— put a great city here, for heaven’s sake— was the spring. Th   e
buildings were the gears.
Necessary  conditions  are  endless  and  mostly  not  pertinent  as
sensible  accounts  of  cause.  Having  liquid  water  at  the  usual  tem-
peratures,  or  a  reasonably  stable  government,  is  necessary  for  a
Great Enrichment, too. But nobody wants to speak of “water- ism”
or “stable- ism.” China had stability, but no Great Enrichment. For
that matt  er, it had liquid water. Th   us too the mistake since Marx of
“capital- ism.”  Th  e pertinent necessary conditions were shared by a
great many societies. Yet such societies did not experience anything
approaching the Great Enrichment.
Skousen told Mc Closkey that “the scarcity of investment capital
has kept us from advancing as fast as we could.” No, it hasn’t. Such a
notion was popular at the World Bank during the long reign of what
the New York University development economist William Easterly
calls  “capital  fundamentalism.”
## 2
Yet  the  historical  and  economic
evidence tells against such thinking. Pour capital into Ghana, yet
it  fails.  Don’t  give  China  a  cent,  yet  it  succeeds.  Th   e  liberating  of
ingenuity in human minds is what matt  ered. Foreign aid has a dismal
track record. Th   e Bourgeois Deal, on the other hand, leads to a Great
Enrichment. Give people liberty and you give them life.
“Capitalism” is a scientifi  c mistake compressed into a single word.
It is dramatically misleading coinage by the enemies of liberty— and
of the sadly misguided among our friends who think they support
liberty, but in their statism hitched to capital fundamentalism end

up not so doing. We recommend in its place “commercially tested
bett  erment” enabled by an ideology of “innovism,” itself enabled by
liberalism.
Th  e innovistic rhetoric honored the dissenter from the old way
of brewing beer or making steel or selling shirts or gett  ing  people
from the bar to their homes in a ride- sharing vehicle instead of a taxi.
Especially, innovism embraced a commercial test that distinguished
the wise dissents of which people approved— as measured by their
willingness to pay with the fruits of their own labors— as against
the  stupid  dissents  of  which  they  would  not  approve,  the  Edsels
and the New Cokes. It’s the intrinsic democracy of commerce, more
precise and powerful than actual voting, as much as we approve of
the human equality of dignity signaled by the right to vote. Traders
and innovators and triers- out of novelties learn by swift    commercial
tests what needs modifi  cation: dissent with modifi  cation. Every en-
gineered and designed product goes through such a test. Aft  er  all,
profi  t is not some arbitrary tax imposed by the power of the bosses.
It is the vote of the consumers, conveyed through the bosses.
A profi  t is revenue in excess of the value of the next- best item for
which the labor, capital, and raw materials could have been used.
It signals a social good, a pat on the back from the invisible hand,
an “att aboy” or “att agirl” from people voting with their dollars. By
contrast, a loss is revenue short of the value of the next- best thing
for which the required labor, capital, land, and raw materials could
have been used— rather than, say, the Apple Newton, the Microsoft
Zune, the Ford Edsel, New Coke, Crystal Pepsi, the McDLT, foot-
ball leagues like the fi rst XFL, AFL (sort of ), WFL, USFL, WLAF,

from the invisible hand. It is, if you prefer, a gentle- but- fi rm hand
conveying the message, “You’re wasting resources, dear, and should
go do something else.” Th   e commercial test is to be contrasted with

terrifying fairy tales about “corporate power” or “manipulation” by
advertising. If big corporations and extensive advertising worked
such magic, contrary to the commercial test of profi  t from consum-
ers, Sears would still be the biggest retailer in the world.
Th   e profi  t test is crucial. Th   e US long- distance passenger railway,
Amtrak, lives on, despite hemorrhaging money, because it can rely
on taxpayers. Th  e economist Randal O’Toole calculates that Am-
trak’s  per- passenger- mile  operating loss is higher than the airlines’
entire per- passenger-mile costs.

A Mars rover that costs $2.5 billion
and produces $2 billion worth of Mars roving, for a social loss of half
a billion, might seem neat, but it’s a waste of resources that makes
the world poorer in delights. Profi  ts send memos relevant to whether
resources are being used well. Governments regularly don’t get the
memos, or refuse to read them. Politics oft  en has other messages in
mind. Th   e Cardinal Amtrak route from Chicago to Washington, DC,
has thirty- one stops, of which more than one- third are in tiny West
Virginia. Hmm. Does that have anything to do with Robert Byrd,
senator from the Mountain State, serving fi  ft  y- one years, longer than
any other senator in history? Could be. Governments by defi nition
exercise  power,  the  ability  we  have  noted  to  coerce  people  to  do
something they are not willing to do. But Ben & Jerry’s ice cream
does not have coercion at its disposal, merely persuasion. If it were to
venture on Listerine- and- castor- oil ice cream, the loss incurred from
day one would send an eloquent memo to the head offi  ce.
Profi  ts  are  not  “incentives”  to  persons  in  the  way  that  the  left
imagines we liberals argue. Th   e   left  notes that Ben Cohen of Ben
& Jerry’s is a very rich man, and he can hardly be incentivized to
signifi cant new eff  orts in devising fl avors by the promise of an extra
million added to his many millions. But that is not the relevant mar-
gin of incentives. Th   e relevant margin is that of sending a memo as
to what is a socially desirable activity, of which more should happen.
If  a  captain  of  industry  earns  10  percent  on  his  bett  erment  when
the rest are earning 5 percent, the economy is saying to him and the
others, “Do more of it.”
Th   at is what was disastrously wrong with Senator Elizabeth War-
ren’s  harmless-  sounding  proposal  in  her  campaign  for  the  presi-

chapter  13
dency  in  2019–  2020  to  take  each  year  “only”  2  percent  of  wealth
away from rich people. Income is the return on wealth, and wealth
is the ownership of physical or human capital that helps produce
things,  such  as  oil  or  hospitals  or  professional  football  games.  If
the percentage return on a million dollars of wealth invested in oil
exploration is 6 percent, it signals by its 1 percentage point advan-
tage over the usual 5 percent that additional investments should be
made in oil exploration. Th   e tax of “only” 2 percent cuts the return
from 6 to 4 percent per year. An investment that earns more than
other investments will aft er tax earn less. It won’t be made, though
socially speaking it should be. In the language of economics, War-
ren’s mild- sounding program would radically distort the patt  ern  of
investment. Th   e wrong investments would be made, a result inten-
sifi ed by the inability of the government seizing the income, even
if it can pin down the billionaires, to use it wisely. All people, and
not just the billionaires directing the investment, would be made
poorer.
From 1800 to the present, the places that listened to profi t made
money, yes, but they enriched everybody by it. Leave me alone, to
profi t, and I’ll make you rich.

Why in

## Europe?
A series of happy accidents, we suggest, beginning early in the
1500s, explains it. Th  e embrace of the obvious and simple system,
and  the  resulting  revaluation  of  commercially  tested  bett  erment,
depended on four happy Rs:
- Reading spread. (Compare the internet.) Th  e printing press, in-
vented centuries before in a unifi ed China, entered a politically
fragmented Europe that made censorship diffi  cult, opening Eu-
rope  to  new  ideas.  At  length  books  gave  northwestern  Europe

the very good idea for a non- slave liberalism once thought to be
insane.
- Reformation, enabled by the Reading, fl  att  ened church governance
and suggested to people that they could take charge of their eco-
nomic lives as much as their spiritual lives.
- Revolt in Holland, 1568– 1648 against Spain, and
- Revolution in England in the 1640s and again in 1689, in the United
States in 1776, and in France in 1789 overthrew old elites and el-
evated radical political ideas about liberty and equality to a new
ideology, the liberalism of Smith and Mary Wollstonecraft    and
Henry David Th   oreau and Mill. Nothing similar was happening
at the time in the other great commercial areas of the globe—
Japan,  China,  the  Mughal  Empire,  and  the  Ott  oman  Empire.
Th  e “right of revolution” in western Europe made people bold.
“Whenever  any  form  of  government  becomes  destructive  of
these ends,” Th   omas   Jeff erson wrote in 1776, which by then was
a cliché among advanced thinkers, “it is the right of the people to
alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.”
Lots  of  Rs.  Yet  the  liberal  happiness  could  easily  have  turned
unhappy, thus “accidents.” Had Spain’s Armada in 1588 succeeded
in landing the best army in Europe on English soil, for instance, the
Radical  Reformation  or  hierarchy-  less  congregations  would  have
been sorely checked, and later English liberalism would have been
stillborn.  Had  Charles  I  not  faced  a  brilliant  Puritan  general,  or
had James II been as tolerant as his older brother had been of non-
Catholics, or had Lord North been less ham- handed, or Louis XVI
bett er advised, the turn to liberalism and then innovism and then
the Great Enrichment might have had to await later developments,
perhaps in China or Turkey. But by 1776, to take that symbolic year,
liberalism in western Europe was on the march. Th   e new equality of
dignity inspired the commoners— that’s you— to multiply new ideas
about cott on spinning and elementary education and steelmaking
and votes for women and mail- order shopping and air- conditioning
and mobile computing by Wi- Fi. Europe, that is, was not special,
merely lucky.

Coal and coastlines and navigable waterways and fertile farmland
have sat for millennia without leading to a Great Enrichment. Said
Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835, “Looking at the turn given to the hu-
man spirit in England by political life; seeing the Englishman . . .
inspired by the sense that he can do anything . . . I am in no hurry to
inquire whether nature has scooped out ports for him, or given him
coal or iron.”
## 1
“Resources” don’t matt  er until new ideas make them
valuable. Red Mountain iron ore, which signs around Birmingham,
Alabama, will tell you “formed the basis” for its steel industry, was
there for eons.
We’re not saying resources didn’t matt  er at all. We’re saying they
didn’t matt  er much, because they are less signifi  cant than you think,
and  there  are  commonly  substitutes  that  human  ingenuity,  when
liberated, found again and again. Th  e world would still have had a
Great Enrichment without resource X, so long as the Englishman (or
the American, or later the Swede or the Japanese), left  to venture,
was inspired by liberalism to the sense that he can do anything. He
fi  nds work-arounds when he encounters obstacles. Th   is or that thing
that  seems  “essential”  has  a  substitute.  Remember  whale  oil.  Th   e
steamboats on the western US rivers ran on wood long aft  er most of
Europe had switched to coal. Th   e same holds for pig iron, for which
the United States and wood- rich Sweden used charcoal from wood
long aft er wood- challenged Britain had switched to coke (not the

drink but a pre- burned form of coal that gave high temperatures for
making iron and steel).
Th   e man in the street thinks that countries become rich because
of resources, in which case Japan and Hong Kong would be poor
and  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the
Congo rich. Th  e man in the street’s mistaken economics can have
bad consequences. Many Latin American voters have a deep and
dangerous conviction that Latin America is rich in resources, and
yet the people are poor. Th   e theme has encouraged wave aft  er  wave
of populist revolutionaries, promising easy redistribution to make
everyone rich. Yet in a modern economy, people on farms compose
only 1 percent of the population (and even in Iowa only 7.6 percent,
many of them with second jobs outside of farming), and those work-
ing in mines or fi sheries less. Th   e natural resources used now in the
US, including urban land, earn 5 percent or less of national income.
Th   ey do not determine much of its level.
## 2
So it is in Latin America.
Lots of things, like coal or free trade or bett  er roads or more sav-
ing, might explain a few percentage points of the Great Enrichment.
But they arrive at nothing like the 900 percent or 2,900 percent or
9,900 percent increase in standards of living to be explained.
## §
Th  e surprising smallness of the usual suspects can be shown from
a weird trick economists use, called “Harberger Triangles,” named
for  the  Nobel-  worthy  economist  Arnold  Harberger.  It  measures
a cause’s static contribution to an economy. You ask, “How big is
the productivity increase in the sector?” Th   en you ask, “How big is
the sector?” Th   en you multiply the two answers. Th   e product is the
increase in national income att  ributable to the sector. Not so weird,
aft  er all: common sense.
Th  e railway is the classic example. Th  e logic of the railway as an
engine of growth is seductive because it made shipping cheaper and
therefore  caused  the  location  of  production  and  consumption  to
change radically. Iowa, for example, has many rivers but few of them

navigable (Cedar Rapids is well named). Without the railway, get-
ting Iowa’s corn to market would have been a lot more expensive.
Th   e railway made land more valuable and increased the demand for
steel and coal. Clearly, it was necessary for American industrializa-
tion, no?
No.  Th  e weird if commonsense trick— which is one way of de-
scribing the pathbreaking research for which Robert Fogel shared
the 1993 Nobel Prize in economics— tells a diff  erent  story.
## 3
## By 1890,
US costs of transporting freight had fallen on the routes railways
traveled by about 50 percent. Big. Th  e transport routes aff  ected  by
rail, however, were only about 50 percent of total freight traffi  c. A
lot of freight and some passengers still traveled by river or canal or
coastal shipping. To this day, a good deal of the corn crop leaves the
Midwest  by  barge.  Still,  a  50  percent  reduction  in  cost  for  half  of
freight traffi    c has to be a big deal, right?
No. Transportation in 1890 accounted for about 10 percent of the
US economy. Put the Harberger trick together. Th   e national percent-
age gain from the railways was the 50 percent reduction in cost, times
the 50 percent of transport that was aff ected, times the 10 percent
of  the  national  product  that  came  from  transport.  Half  of  half  of
a tenth is 2.5 percent. Two- and- a- half percent, one time, is nice to
have. But it’s not revolutionary. It was about one year’s growth in the
US economy. Th   e romantic stories about the iron horse are wrong.
True, the coming of the railway shuffl  ed the location of produc-
tion.  Railways  explain  why  Chicago  and  not  Saint  Louis  became
the economic capital of the Midwest. Without railways, the riverine
excellence of Saint Louis might have won the prize (though the por-
tage at Chicago, we have noted, still made transshipment by water
easy there, giving Chicago double the waterways). But shuffl    ing  is
not a net gain. Capital and labor went to Chicago instead of Saint
Louis. It’s not a net gain. Th   e   net gain to the nation is that 2.5 percent.
In Bourgeois Dignity and Bourgeois Equality, Mc Closkey used the
method of Harberger Triangles relentlessly to estimate the eff  ects  of
various bett erments. If you think that the static gain to this or that
item is the cause of the Great Enrichment, you have an appointment
with Harberger. Foreign trade? Small. Cott on and cott  on  textiles?

Small. Th   rift ? Small. All together, however, as we’ve noted, bett  er-
ments like dropped ceilings (Ever thought of that one? In your offi  ce,
look up!) and containerization and steam engines and McGuff  ey’s
Reader and the rest were the Great Enrichment. But the ingenuity
had to be astonishingly widespread and persistent to overcome the
logic of Harberger Triangles. It means that the widespreadness and
the persistence are what need explanation. It leads us back to Toc-
queville’s  Englishman,  or  American,  and  now  Indian  or  Chinese,
inspired by the sense that he or she can do anything.
## §
And in any case the timing for each alleged “one big cause” is wrong.
Economics aside, history rejects them. Trade, for example, is ancient.
People traded obsidian and shells vigorously across great distances
many millennia ago. Amber from the shores of the Baltic and lapis
lazuli from Afghanistan turn up in Egyptian grave goods. European
grain prices moved together by arbitrage in the late Middle Ages.

By the early eighteenth century, decades before the Great Enrich-
ment got going, the English- Scott  ish grain markets were tightly in-
tegrated indeed. But they were even more tightly integrated in China
at the time. Th  e trade of the Indian Ocean was larger than that of
the Atlantic for hundreds of years before the Enrichment, without
causing one. Trade was a necessary gear in the watch, but nothing
like the spring.
“Not so fast,” you say. “Surely, as many students of the matt  er  have
argued  recently,  the  enforcement  of  property  rights  is  the  spring.”
Oh, no. It is again necessary, but nothing like suffi  cient, as we have
said. English common law was in place hundreds of years before the
Enrichment. Th   e anthropological historian Alan MacFarlane notes
that “England was as ‘capitalist’ in 1250 as it was in 1550 or 1750.”

relied on property rights and the rule of law. Buying and selling was
secure, usually. True, Henry Tudor’s victory at Bosworth Field in
1485 ended at last an economy- wrecking War of the Roses, and with
it many decades of baronial disregard for such rights. Yet good prop-
erty rights characterized for centuries much of Europe, even crazy

England, without yielding modern growth. Until the seventeenth
century, the enforcement of loans in the capital markets of Italy was
much more advanced than those of northern Europe. And indeed,
loaning and borrowing on a large and small scale was commonplace
everywhere in world history. “Capitalism”— if it merely means profi  t-
making business and the making of such credit transactions— was
for centuries stretching into millennia as vigorous in Shanghai and
Mumbai as it was in Sheffi    eld and Manchester. One can study labor
and property contracts and long- distance credit and business lett  ers
in startlingly modern form from Mesopotamia, now Iraq, inscribed
on clay two thousand years before Christ.
In any case, mere sets of laws— the “rules of the game” that North
and his followers assert are the cause of our riches— are strikingly
insuffi    cient. Gears, not springs; commonplace, not special to north-
western Europe in the eighteenth century. Th   e law of the Mongols
did not inspire an explosion of bett erment. Of an Iceland without
kings, Njàl’s Saga writt en in the thirteenth century concerning the
tenth century declares, Með lögum skal land byggja, “With law will
the land be built,” and so it was.

Most societies worldwide, with
rare exceptions such as Russia under an all- owning tsar, had in such
matt  ers thoroughly matched England in 1689. Th   e ancient Near East
had “norms and rules of behavior,” writes the Assyriologist Norman
Yo ff  ee, and local powers to back them up. Law codes such as that of
Hammurabi of Babylon, who had by the early eighteenth century
BCE  established  a  wide  hegemony,  which  “his”  laws  were  meant
to justify. But they “were not the foundations of order in Mesopo-
tamian  society,”  Yoff  ee  argues,  because  the  order  already  existed,
arising from the bott  om up, à la Iceland, “but were . . . instruments
used to proclaim a [centralized] simplicity that did not exist.”

## For
ordinary English people, the laws that matt  ered most were for cen-
turies before the eighteenth century the vigorously enforced local
laws of “leet” courts in each village, concerning crop rotations and
theft   of land and theft   of life.
And  people  can  innovate  around  many  black-  lett  er  rules.  Th   e

a  note  that  the  winner  of  the  auction  would  also  get  four  tickets
to the Cardinals- Dodgers playoff  game. A litt  le  ineffi    cient,  yes.  An
insurmountable barrier to prosperity, no. If the Great Enrichment
had “simply” been a matt er of gett  ing the rules (and, therefore, the
incentives) right, someone probably would have found a way to do
it, considering the enormous free lunch to be picked up. Laws are
in part endogenous, as economists would put it: self- generated in
response to profi t opportunities, for the public good or the public
ill. Witness suburban towns working to att  ract Walmart and Target;
and likewise large cities, at the behest of competitors of Walmart,
working to keep it out.
## 8
Ideologies  about  a  commercial  society,  and  about  expert  rule,
govern the outcome as much as does the social gain from effi  ciency.
In  social  democratic  Europe,  the  owners  of  property  downtown
can pass laws to prevent cheaper commercial strips from develop-
ing  outside.  In  the  somewhat  more  economically  liberal  US  they
mostly can’t. Th  e result in the US is unlovely but effi  cient. In the
expert- driven liberal parts of Europe— in Germany and Estonia, for
example— return- free tax fi ling is routine, saving those maddening
days in April to give the IRS information about your income that it
already has. In the K- Street- corrupt US, by contrast, TurboTax and
H&R Block have bribed members of Congress to keep you enslaved
to doing the pointless April job. Th  ey might as well have arranged
for you to break rocks. Your tax dollars at work.

Nor saving. As economists, we of course love saving and investment.
Provide, provide, said the poet. You yourself should do more of it
because it is an exercise in caring for you and yours— and, if your
bank loans out your saving, caring for society as a whole. Ebenezer
Scrooge’s saving increased England’s capital stock. Yes.
And  yet  more  saving,  and  the  resulting  pile  of  machines  and
bachelor’s degrees, does not do the trick, as Mc Closkey noted in her
debate with Mark Skousen described earlier. Consider. Th   e   ances-
tors used the so- called Acheulean hand axes, unchanged in design,
for over a million years. It wasn’t an “ax,” exactly, merely a sharpened
stone such as fl int fi tt ed to the human hand and useful for cutt  ing,
scraping, and throwing at hyenas trying to get to the same antelope
carcass that the local humans were cutt  ing up. Archaeological sites
contain scores of them, sometimes hundreds. It was capital accu-
mulation. But by piling up the Acheulean hardware, the ancestors
did  not  make  themselves  thirtyfold  richer.  Piling  up  is  precisely
what saving is by itself, absent new ideas for bett  er axes. More hand
axes would have had a use, but with diminishing marginal returns.
Th  e hundredth one wouldn’t yield much in bett er fending off    hy-
enas. Th   ink of a hundredth pair of your shoes; and more so a third
house, on which you also have to keep up the roof. Merely piling
up hand axes or shoes or houses is accumulation without (much)
bett  erment,  and  isn’t  what  greatly  enriched  the  world.  But  a  new

## 103
idea manifesting itself in bett  er tools, houses, shoes, or procedures is
the spring, a  human creativity liberated from the conservative rule
or law or routine.
Again  the  historical  evidence  reinforces  the  economic  logic.
Prudent, temperate saving happens in every society, by necessity. In
medieval Europe the yields in barley or wheat per unit of seed were
pathetically low, four or fi ve. It required adults to ignore the weep-
ing of their hungry children in the spring, and to engage in saving
on a very big scale, by broadcasting on plowed ground upwards of
a  quarter  of  the  grain  crop.  Th   e  problem  in  the  Middle  Ages  was
the absence of new ideas for investment, not the absence of a fund
for saving.
Saving rates in enriching England, actually, were lower than the
European norm. As a share of national income, investment in physi-
cal capital was 6 percent in England and 12 percent around Europe
in  1760,  and  8  percent  in  England  but  12  percent  in  Europe  again
in  1800.  British  investment  rose,  but  the  Britons  were  less  thrift  y
than their backward neighbors.
## 1
What they had were strikingly new
ideas for the use of the saving, for instance the Duke of Bridgewater’s
river- bridging  canals.
Exhortations to thrift   are anyway ancient. Th   e Hebrew Bible as-
sociates thrift  with diligence: “Th  e sluggard will not plough in the
autumn by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in [the] harvest,
and have nothing”; “Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He
shall stand before kings” (Proverbs 20:4; 22:29). Th  e Koran (7:31)
says,  “God  does  not  like  the  prodigals.”  Saving  is  praised  in  Bud-
dhism, among other non- Abrahamic faiths, as in the “Admonition
to Singala” advising
He should divide
His money in four parts;
On one part he should live,
With two expand his trade,
And the fourth he should save
Against a rainy day.

Th   is  holy  text  of  South  Asia  is  recommending  here  a  saving  rate

So powerful is the conviction in economics since Adam Smith that
capital accumulation is the spring of growth that in 1956 even the
great  Ludwig  von  Mises,  the  Austrian  economist  émigré  to  the
United States whom Carden and Mc Closkey admire extravagantly,
gets  it  wrong.  Mises  writes,  “Saving,  capital  accumulation,  is  the
agency that has transformed step- by- step the awkward search for
food on the part of savage cave dwellers into the modern ways of
industry.” No, it isn’t. Accumulation was necessary, as were sunlight
and the presence of a labor force, but it raised income sharply only
when  it  embodied  brilliant  new  ideas,  such  as  containerization.
Mises then drift  s into a related error: “Th   e pacemakers of this evolu-
tion were the ideas that created the institutional framework within
which capital accumulation was rendered safe by the principle of
private ownership of the means of production.” True, there needed
to exist the ancient idea of protections for property. But it had been
widespread in human societies, as we have repeatedly noted, from
the cave dwellers on down. Th  en he goes back to accumulation by
itself: “Every step forward on the way toward prosperity is the eff  ect
of saving.” Doubtful. Saving is necessary, yes, yes. But so is an endless
list of things necessary. Th   e existence of language. Counting systems.
Liquid water. Th  e universe. It then seems to occur to Mises what
the actual spring was, though he mentions it only to push it aside:
“Th   e most ingenious technological inventions would be practically
useless if the capital goods required for their utilization had not been
accumulated by saving.”
## 3
He is falling headlong into the logical error
of taking necessity as suffi    ciency. Try substituting “liquid water” for
“capital accumulation” and for “capital goods,” and “gett  ing  liquid
water” for “saving.” Th  en proceed to a liquid water theory of eco-
nomic growth.

Consider 1492 China, which as we have noted had had a century-
long peace, excellent property rights, enforcement of law, absence
of crushing within- China tariff s (another contrast to Europe), and
plenty of capital, able to build the Great Wall and the Grand Canal
with ease, exceeding in the use of saving even Roman capital proj-
ects.  Yet  China,  from  which  in  the  past  a  majority  of  the  world’s
technical bett  erments had come, did not have the astounding explo-
sion of ingenuity tested commercially that fi  nally aft  er 1800 enriched
northwestern Europe.
Th  e classical and Marxist idea that capital begets capital, “end-
lessly,” is hard to shake. In 1983 the historical sociologist Immanuel
Wallerstein we mentioned back in chapter 13 wrote of “the endless
accumulation of capital, a level of waste that may begin to border
on  the  irreparable.”
## 4
Th   e  “endless”/“never-  ending”  expressions,
still resonating in all notions of “capitalism,” originated twenty- two
centuries before Karl Marx in the Greek aristocratic disdain for com-
merce. People of business (declared aristocratic Plato and aristocrat-
tutoring Aristotle) are motivated by apeiros (unlimited) greed. Th   us
Aristotle in the Ethics. Th   e “no limit” in Aristotle is about commerce,
which is supposed not to exhibit the diminishing returns that, say,
agriculture does. In the thirteenth century, Th   omas Aquinas, refer-
ring to Aristotle (with a litt  le less than his customary enthusiasm for
“Th   e Philosopher”), retails the usual complaint against commerce,
which depends on “the greed for gain, which knows no limit and
tends to infi nity.”
## 5
As the political scientist John Danford observes,
“Th   e belief that there is something objectionable about [‘unlimited’
gain] has persisted for more than two thousand years. . . . Th   e   endur-
ing legacy . . . was . . . the view that . . . commerce or the acquisition
of wealth is not merely low; it is unnatural, a perversion of nature,
and unworthy of a decent human being.”

Th   e spring was not accumulated capital or old institutions or easily

fi  rst applied with vigor in northwestern Europe. Liberating ordinary
people turned out to inspire them to extraordinary ideas, which re-
directed the capital, and the liquid water, and the labor force. Our
friend Skousen, we have noted, channels Mises in the contrary error
of “capital- ism.” Th   e historical and economic evidence tells against
the  notion.  Th   e  liberating  of  ingenuity  in  human  minds  is  what
matt ered, as in India aft er 1991 and in China aft er 1878 and in the
Anglosphere aft er 1776. Give people liberty, we have said, and you
give them life. In the third act, you give them a rich life in every sense.
If the capital fundamentalism of the Wall Street theorists were
correct, then their enemies the socialists would be correct, too. Th   e
socialists like Wallerstein assume that the key to capitalism is capital
and therefore that the big issue is its accumulation and allocation.
So do the Wall Street theorists such as Skousen. Both believe that
ideas or entrepreneurship or management are easy. Ideas, they say,
are a dime a dozen. Th   at’s why the Wall Street theorists dote on the
TV  program  Shark  Tank,  in  which  ideas  are  easily  shot  down  by
deep- pocketed investors, and it’s why the socialists think that the
government in Paris or Washington can easily order up an appropri-
ate socialization of investment. Both are sure that the future is easy
to lay down. Just accumulate. Liberals know that the future depends
on unpredictable ideas from free humans.
So, no. Skousen and Smith and Marx and even our modern hero
Mises are mistaken. “Capitalism,” and the associated idea that ac-
cumulating  capital  is  the  watch  spring  of  enrichment,  needs  to
be retired.

We’re  sorry  to  be  the  bearers  of  more  bad  news.  We  love  school-
ing— we loved it so much that we never left . And we love science,
especially when it is correctly defi ned (as in every language aside
from quite recent English) as “systematic inquiry” about anything,
whether physics or theology or economics. Th   us the Germans speak
of Klassischewiisenschaft  (classics, the systematic study of Greek and
Latin)  and  the  French  les  sciences  humaines  (including  systematic
literary study). We are not fond, that is, of the narrowing defi nition
of the word in English, emerging from certain academic disputes at
Oxford and Cambridge a century and a half ago— namely, “science”
confi ned to physical and biological science, alone.
## 1
No.  All the sci-
ences, physical and humanistic, together.
So, hurrah for widening of the human spirit by schooling and sci-
ence. If you can read this book, thank a teacher in your distant past. If
you are in fact a scientist, even by the narrowing only- physical defi  ni-
tion, swell. We admire you, as we admire, too, poets and athletes and
businesspeople and English professors and ordinary people working
to get by.
But as sources of the Great Enrichment, the wonderful schooling
and glorious science were limited in scope. Th  e Great Enrichment
got going without much schooling and without much in the way
of “high” science in the new defi nition in English. Until 1900 or so,
neither was very important to the economy. As the economic histo-
rian David Mitch, the doyen of historical studies of education in its

economic aspect, puts it, “England, during its Industrial Revolution
1780 to 1840 experienced a notable acceleration in economic growth
yet displayed litt  le evidence of improvement in the educational at-
tainments of its workforce.”
## 2
Th   e   eff  ect of the later mass public edu-
cation in Britain, according to the economic historian Jason Long,
was “surprisingly modest.”
## 3
More schooling certainly would have led
Fantine and Cosett e to more fl ourishing lives in spirit. And yes, it
would have made them richer, maybe two or three times richer. But
that wasn’t what lift ed the masses of French people out of poverty.
You can see the truth of such a proposition from recent studies of
how  much  more  a  college  graduate  makes  compared  with  a  high
school dropout. Th   e college grad will earn two or three times more
in lifetime income. Good, and a good reason to stay in school. But
one is not dealing with two or three times bett er but rather thirty
times bett  er.
Education is commonly seen as a fairy dust in raising up the poor.
In South Africa, for example, the laws prevent very poor people from
having  any  jobs  at  all.  In  particular,  a  high  legal  minimum  wage,
coupled  with  the  inability  to  fi  re  employees  who  steal,  prevents
very poor people from competing with members of trade unions.
It leaves 50 percent of young people without jobs. Benevolent folk,
who have jobs in the government or in the universities, are troubled
by the unemployment. But they do not recommend gett ing rid of
the  minimum  wage  and  the  labor  laws  that  cause  it.  Th   ey  do  not
want poor people to fi  nd voluntary agreements to be hired, making
everyone bett  er  off  . No, they recommend that South African schools
be radically (and magically) improved, to make the young people
productive  enough  to  be  worth  employing  at  the  high  minimum
wage. Create unemployment by coercive governmental action. Solve
it not by reversing the governmental action that caused it but by add-
ing still more coercive governmental action. If that doesn’t work . . .
then add still more coercion.
Th  e educational coercion in taxes and schools for fancy jobs is
back to front. If South Africans were allowed to work at whatever
wage employers were willing to off er, or were allowed to start busi-
nesses  without  onerous  governmental  licenses,  everyone  would
have a job and an income, and everyone would send their children

to school. You do not need to know algebra or English literature to
work in retail in Cape Town, or to run a food truck in Chicago, or to
work as a messenger in Paris. A Cape Town or Chicago or Paris in
which employment is not hampered will come to want education.
People will then learn the joys of Geoff rey Chaucer soon enough,
for “gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche.”
## §
Doesn’t Jack’s schooling, though, benefi  t Jill? If the government left
education to an unregulated free market, it is said, people wouldn’t
get enough of it, because they don’t account for the good spillovers
to others. Schooling is said to be like a fl  u shot: our fl  u shots reduce
the likelihood that you will get infected. Free markets will suppos-
edly  underprovide  fl  u  shots.  In  the  same  way,  people  all  benefi  t
from living in a society in which most have literacy and numeracy.
Because school is hard and expensive and not always fun, people
won’t get enough, unless the government steps in with its coercion.
Or so it seems to some people. It’s clear that there are spillover
benefi ts from other people gett ing elementary readin’, writin’, and
’rithmetic. But it’s not clear that education beyond, say, eighth grade
spills over enough to justify massive subsidies to high schoolers, and
especially to university students. Mostly the gain accrues to the high
schoolers or university graduates themselves. If so, in justice and in
effi    ciency, they or their parents should pay for it.
What we now consider ordinary arithmetic entered late into the
education of even the aristocracy and the clergy and other nonmer-
cantile  professions.  Samuel  Johnson  advised  a  rich  woman,  “Let
your  boy  learn  arithmetic”  (note  the  supposition  that  the  heir  to
a great fortune would usually fail to do so). “He will not then be a
prey  to  every  rascal  which  this  town  swarms  with:  teach  him  the
value of money and how to reckon with it.”
## 4
## In 1803 Harvard College
required, naturally, fl uency in both Latin and Greek for all the boys
proposing to att  end. Yet only in that year did it also make arithmetic
a requirement.
But  in  fact—  and  this  is  the  kind  of  shockingly  cynical  and
conversation-  killing  view  that  makes  economists  such  big  hits  at

## 110
## *
chapter  16
dinner parties— subsidized schooling beyond a certain point wastes
resources by pushing people into school when their time and the
other inputs into the education would be bett  er used elsewhere, as
judged  by  a  market  test.  Th   e  central  case  is  university  education,
which in most of the world is provided free (or, rather, “free”) to
qualifi ed applicants. Economists note that the result is to subsidize
the upper middle class, whose children are anyway best prepared for
university, by taxing everyone else. Very poor countries give subsi-
dies to university students exceeding by a factor of ten the subsidies
to K– 8 students. When it is proposed in France to add any university
tuition at all, the students riot in the streets. Th   ey are mostly middle
class, the sons and daughters of lawyers and doctors and business-
people.  In  the  1950s  the  University  of  California  system  charged
exceptionally low tuitions. It was a subsidy from poor taxpayers to
rich children of lawyers. To a lesser degree than in the 1950s, it still is.
And it’s not clear that the spillovers from higher schooling are
always positive. A non- diverse system of education, provided by a
monopoly of church or state, can of course miseducate. Th   e   human
capital Mc Closkey acquired early by reading Prince Kropotkin at
the  Carnegie  library  and  learning  socialism  Joan-  Baez-  style  over
the airwaves, and even in a good deal of her Harvard instruction in
Keynesian economics, with its lessons of magic free lunches for all,
was a factor of destruction, not a factor of production. Th   e   people
studying to become bett  er nudgers, meddlers, bureaucrats, admin-
istrators, or Keynesian magicians do damage to the rest of us.
And  it  is  possible  anyway  to  overeducate,  at  any  rate  in  prepa-
ration for the work of the world. For many hundreds of years the
Chinese system of examinations encouraged humanistic learning,
as European universities did only later, and haltingly. Th   e   rigorous
examinations, initiated by the Han dynasty aft er 206 BCE and still
going strong under the Qing until 1911, yielded about 18,000 degree
holders a year. In, say, 1600 the Chinese fi gure was roughly compa-
rable to the number of graduates of universities in a Europe with
roughly the same population then as China (150 million in China
and 100 million in Europe). Th   e production of such human capital
in China was hugely superior to that in Europe for at least fi ft  een
centuries aft er it began. It remained bett er than Europe’s into the

Schooling and Science Were Not the Fairy Dust
## *
## 111
eighteenth century. Th   en the university reforms in Europe aft  er  1810
and the explosion of population in China caused a great divergence
in graduates proportionate to population. Th  e Chinese 18,000 did
not rise, but the number of graduates in Europe did, and notably in
chemistry and other physical sciences.
Th   e result in China was not the worst one can imagine, because
knowing classical Chinese poetry, which the examinations tested,
is a good thing for a human. Consult rock lyrics or country music.
But it obviously did not yield bureaucrats who knew, say, calculation
or accounts— though in fact China was until 1492 well ahead of the
world in calculation, too. And Europe in the education of its rulers
was  for  a  long  time  no  more  utilitarian.  As  long  as  Latin  was  the
lingua franca, allowing Poles and Italians to write to each other, the
Latin- based education in grammar schools was helpful to the world’s
work— though such learning was confi ned again to the clerisy, and
not even much of the gentry or aristocracy until late.
Yet  as  the  historian  Jonathan  Daly  argues,  in  explaining  the
stagnation of Chinese inventiveness during the past fi ve centuries,
just when Europe was waking up, “One could achieve no higher or
more remunerative honor in society. Some brilliant [Chinese] men
studied mathematics, astronomy, and  law,  but  they  received  only
scant offi    cial encouragement. Some brilliant literati- offi    cials  pursued
research  and  refl  ection  in  non-  literary  fi  elds,  but  without  institu-
tional backing. Th   e examination system was thus a unifying force in
Chinese culture but at the cost of stifl ing much creative thinking.”
## 5
Th   at is, liberal educations and civil service examinations (adopted
by Europeans in the nineteenth century in explicit imitation, Daly
points out, of the fabled system of China) can be conservative, in
both a good sense and a bad. When the great and original economist
John Maynard Keynes took the examination for the Civil Service in
1906, his worst grades were in . . . economics.

## No.
People can innovate even though they believe the sun revolves
around the earth or that a minimum wage does not reduce employ-
ment of the very poor. Did David Beckham need to study physics
to learn how to bend it like Beckham? Does your bartender need a
degree in chemistry to mix a good drink? Did Colonel Sanders need
higher education to come up with his original recipe of eleven herbs
and spices? No, no, and no. Far more bett  erment  happened  (and
happens) the way people learn to bend it like Beckham— imitation
and practice— and the way people learn how to mix good drinks or
make good fried chicken: by trial and error, not high science.
Th   e number of crucial bett  erments that did not spring from recent
science is considerable: mass- produced concrete, reinforced con-
crete,  air  brakes  that  made  mile-  long  trains  possible,  the  military
organization that kept the trains running on schedule and from run-
ning into one another (yes, the telegraph was science- dependent,
and important in the case), elevators, asset markets, cheap paper,
retail logistics, high- inventory- turnover warehouse clubs, craisins
(reconstituted cranberry husks), Kingsford charcoal (from left  over
wood scraps at the Ford factory), steel, eyeglasses, and a list of other
bett  erments that could go on for whole books. Libraries, even.
Consider too dropped ceilings, plate glass, horse railways, horse
trams,  plumbing,  irrigation,  city  water  pressure,  macadamized
roads, vulcanized rubber, canning of food, selective breeding (old
but pushed harder: dogs, horses, Darwin’s pigeons, but then cott  on
plants, catt  le), mass steel, spring- driven clocks and watches, central
heating, wire twist- links (though plastic was needed), and on and
on. Litt  le before 1800. An explosion aft  er  1800.

plicated technology: divided highways, containerization again, the
modern university, hotel chains, restaurant chains, franchises of all

sorts, condominium real estate, registers of property, weather report-

Th   e West had a Scientifi  c Revolution, late, but much of its science
until the seventeenth century and the use of the European lead in
optics consisted of rediscovering things the Chinese had known for
centuries,  or  ancient  knowledge  as  in  mathematics  refi  ned  in  the
Middle East. Place- value arithmetic, for example, was invented twice
in history, once in south Asia and once in Guatemala, and came to
the West by way of a tardy adoption of Arabic learning. Th   e   word
algebra comes from the Arabic al- jabr, “the reunion of broken parts.”
Chinese and Arab science was far more sophisticated than European.
Th   e science of prisms and planets that Newton at length practiced
did not help much in worldly pursuits. But at length, with the de-
mocratization of an innovism, useful bett  erments poured forth from
the craft  workshops— not mainly the laboratories. Th   e   sometimes
amused esteem for the physical scientist— from Th   e   Absent-   Minded
Professor inventing fl  ubber to Doc Emmett   Brown inventing the fl  ux
capacitor and sending Marty McFly Back to the Future to Rick Mora-
nis’s character in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids to Rick Sanchez drinking
his way across the multiverse— was a good thing. But the revaluation
of the petit bourgeois tinkering in his stable and at length his garage
was much more consequential until late.
Science  borrowed  from  commerce,  most  famously  the  steam
engine inspiring the high science of thermodynamics. One could
argue, as the economic historian Joel Mokyr does, that what mat-
tered  for  bett  erment  was  the  change  in  outlook  among  a  narrow
technical  elite.
## 6
An  essay  he  wrote  with  the  economic  historians
Cormac Ó Gráda and Morgan Kelly puts it this way: “What counted
above all was [Britain’s] highly skilled mechanics and engineers, who
may not have been a large proportion of the labor force.”
## 7
If one is
speaking of the immediate cause, he’s right. Mokyr’s heroes are “the
top 3– 5 percent of the labor force in terms of skills: engineers, me-
chanics, millwrights, chemists, clock-  and instrument makers, skilled

## 114

carpenters and metal workers, wheelwrights, and similar workmen.”
## 8

One could hardly have such a revolutionary machine for the manu-
facturing in bulk of the wood screw and the nut- and- bolt without
men like Henry Maudslay (1771– 1831), already educated in making
machines. In 1964 a twenty- two- year- old male student of economic
history, one “Donald” Mc Closkey, found hilarious the remark by
a historian of the lathe, a Dr. Holtzappel: “Mr. Maudslay eff  ected
nearly the entire change from the old imperfect and accidental prac-
tice of screw making . . . to the modern exact and scientifi c mode
now generally followed by engineers; and he pursued the subject of
the screw with more or less ardor and at an enormous expense until
his death in 1831.”
## 9
But Holtzappel was exactly right, and he supports
Mokyr’s point that a tiny elite matt  ered, and that making profi t was
not its entire motive.
Yet where did such a technical elite come from, with its education
and ardor and expense? In Holland and Britain and the United States
it came from ordinary people freed from ancient suppression of their
hopes. Such freeing is the sole way of achieving a suffi    cient  mass  of
technically skilled folk, oriented not toward rare luxuries or military
victories but toward the ordinary goods of peacetime for the bulk of
ordinary people— iron bridges, chemical bleaching, weaving of wool
cloth by machines powered by falling water. Th  e problem in, say,
France in the eighteenth century was that the engineers came from
the younger sons of its large nobility, such as Napoleon, educated
for military careers. In Britain, by contrast, a promising lad from the
working class could become a bourgeois master of new machines
and  of  new  institutions,  as  an  engineer  or  an  entrepreneur.  Or  at
least he could do prett  y well as a clockmaker or spinning- machine
mechanic. In Britain and its off  shoots, the career of the enterprising
bourgeois or the skilled worker, as in Napoleon’s army or Nelson’s
navy, was open to talent. John Harrison (1693– 1776), the inventor
of the marine chronometer, which solved by machine the problem
in the wideness of the sea of fi nding longitude— against the arro-
gantly enforced demand by the elite that it be solved in the heavens
by a literally high science of astronomy— was a rural Lincolnshire
carpenter. His fi rst clock was made of wood. Similarly, Maudslay of

Schooling and Science Were Not the Fairy Dust

## 115
the screw- making machine, two years younger than Napoleon and
thirteen years younger than Nelson, began work at the age of twelve
fi  lling cartridges at the Royal Arsenal, becoming then a blacksmith,
and  by  age  eighteen  a  locksmith,  and  more.  Th   e  British  working
man carried the baton of a fi  eld marshal of industry in his backpack.
Poor boys entering on chemical educations were permitt  ed to have
a go and produced a veritable idea explosion: for instance, about
nitroglycerine, dynamite, gelignite, TNT, and C- 4.
Mokyr is taking as given a structure that in fact had a vibrant mod-
ern history, a history driven by the new and bizarre ethic of human
equality, of liberty in law and of dignity in esteem. Th   e economic his-
torian Karine van der Beek believes she is supporting Mokyr when
she concludes with persuasive evidence that “the innovations and
technological changes that were taking place in eighteenth- century
England increased the demand for these high quality mechanical
workmen.”
## 10
But her case is the opposite of Mokyr’s, which is that
what caused the bett  erment was the supply.
Th   e  entirely  new  ethical  context,  we  are  claiming,  made  the
demand for the engineers and entrepreneurs grow its own supply,
when ardor and opportunity made the supply worth having. Th   e
opportunities themselves arose from a new equality in law and in so-
ciety, encouraging new ideas for Dutch wholesale trade or new ideas
for English coal mining. Th  e new and liberal, if partial, equality in
Holland and Britain and especially in the United States— for all the
lingering sins in Britain of class snobbery and in the United States
of chatt  el slavery— allowed many of the ordinary, and extraordinary,
to have a go.
True, the world would not have artifi cial fertilizer and the att  en-
dant increases in agricultural productivity were it not for the high
science of organic chemistry, and it would not have had the green
revolution without genetics and its applications in agronomy. But
without the beginnings of the Great Enrichment, the world would
not have had the money to apply the natural sciences to technologi-
cal problems. Like imperialism and trade, high science was more a
result  of  economic  growth  than  a  cause.  Th   e  writer  Matt    Ridley
puts it this way: “When you examine the history of innovation, you

## 116

chapter  16
fi  nd,  again  and  again,  that  scientifi  c  breakthroughs  are  the  eff  ect,
not the cause, of [mere] technological change. It is no accident that
astronomy blossomed in the wake of the age of exploration [and we
would say, the telescope from a Dutch eyeglass maker]. Th   e   steam
engine owned almost nothing to the science of thermodynamics,
but [as we have said] the science of thermodynamics owed almost
everything to the steam engine. Th  e discovery of the structure of
DNA  depended  heavily  on  X-  ray  crystallography  of  biological
molecules,  a  technique  developed  in  the  wool  industry  to  try  to
improve textiles.”
## 11
Mokyr believes that the high science of realizing that air had weight
was important early in making possible for people to imagine the
very fi  rst, and “atmospheric,” steam engines (that is, vacuum- driven,
sucking the piston in by the outside pressure of the atmosphere as
the steam cooled and condensed back into water). True. But if one
does the long- term accounting correctly by weighting bett  erments
by their economic importance instead of merely listing a thousand
of them and expressing dazzled admiration, science does not show
much  of  an  economic  impact  until  aft  er  about  1900.  Most  of  our
riches until then, and quite a few of them down to the present (mass-
produced veneers and polished granite, divided superhighways), are
the result of technologists, the anonymous tinkerers and then the
engineers, rather than the high scientists.
We have been using the phrase “high science” because we want
to discourage you from using another and dangerous word we have
mentioned, much on the popular tongue, “science and technology.”
It is in eff ect a German portmanteau, used by biological and espe-
cially  physical  scientists  to  claim  credit  for  technology,  much  of
which  is  only  remotely  connected  with  their  work.  High-  energy
physicists at CERN outside Geneva, who should be embarrassed
that high- energy physics has stagnated for some fi  ft  y years (and who
therefore are led to call most of matt  er and energy “dark”), use sci-
enceandtechnology to keep the billions fl  owing. (We do not exempt
our own beloved science of economics from such characterization,
though the amount spent on it is three orders of magnitude below
what is spent on physics and astronomy; if we spent one order of

magnitude  more  on  economics,  we  would  have  such  a  superior
under standing of the causes of economic growth that we could easily
save out of the resulting growth even more money for elementary
particles and manned voyages to Mars). Th   e so- called STEM fi elds
of  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics  are  much
in vogue nowadays. Th  e Japanese minister of education proposed
closing all public university departments except STEM fi  elds, on the
barbaric assumption that only they were of use. Yet STEM includes
the M of the mathematicians chiefl  y interested in Greek- style proofs
in number theory or algebraic topology, which have epsilon applica-
tions to technology. Th   at is, almost none. Much of the S in science,
likewise, will never economically benefi t any human— for example
cosmology, as noble as is its purpose of illuminating our place in the
universe. Th  eology and poetry, though, and most of painting and
rock music, have on that subject more to say.
Not science.

Nor was it successful violence of any stripe that made the West rich.
Most obviously, it wasn’t warfare. As it turns out, aggressions that en-
courage the killing of your people and their suppliers and demand-
ers are not really very good for you. War, like plague, might have
kept wages high by keeping the amount of labor low relative to the
available land, but where war fl ourished most— the German lands
during the Th   irty Years’ War (1618– 1648), for instance, killing a third
of their population— prosperity did not. Slavery, colonialism, and
imperialism don’t explain why Walmart cashiers in the United States
make so much more than their counterparts elsewhere in the world.
To be clear, we are not suggesting that the evils of war, slavery,
imperialism, and colonialism were justifi ed, or anything other than
evil. True, it was only bourgeois places, we have noted, that began to
end the evil. Until England in the late eighteenth century, war was
the usual hobby of kings, imperialism seemed blameless, and hardly
anyone objected to the system of slavery. And, true, “everyone” does
it: African empires, like ancient Rome’s and Athens’s and Israel’s,
were slave societies, and aft  er their hobby wars the African imperial-
ists sold people to the Europeans or Arabs waiting off   the coast. Th   e
Sioux native Americans were tyrants of other native Americans. Yet
such “what- about” does not excuse evil.
Or in these cases stupidity. We are saying, to be precise, that war,
slavery, imperialism, and colonialism were on the whole economi-
cally stupid. Suppose killing people, taking their stuff  , and establish-

ing empire could create an “original accumulation of capital” that
would jump- start the “capitalist mode of production” and thereby
create a Great Enrichment. If so, as we have argued repeatedly, it
would have happened a long time ago and not in northwestern Eu-
rope. Imperialism isn’t a new idea. Th   e French liberal Jean- Baptiste
Say remarked in 1803, before imperialism became fashionable among
the clerisy, “Dominion by land or sea will appear equally destitute
of att raction, when it comes to be generally understood that all its
advantages rest with the rulers, and that the [home] subjects at large
derive no benefi  t whatever.”

In 1923, in the aft  ermath of  World War I,
a  later  liberal,  the  Italian  economist  and  future  president  of  Italy
Luigi Einaudi wrote, “Before the [First World] war it was a favorite
doctrine with nationalists that new, rising nations . . . were called to
high destinies, to conquer territories, to become world Powers. . . .
Th   e war of new and rising nations against old and stationary . . . was
erroneous both historically and economically.”

Alas, others disagreed, such as the American Th   eodore   Roosevelt,
or the Japanese prime minister Hideki Tojo. “Our nation,” declared
Tojo, “stands at a crossroads, one road leading to glory and the other
to decline.”

One still hears such guff . In 1997 the geographer Jared
Diamond wrote a brilliant book, Guns, Germs, and Steel: Th   e   Fates
of Human Societies, which was meant to answer the question of a
New  Guinea  highlander  of  his  acquaintance:  “Why  do  you  have
so much cargo?” He was asking about the Japanese and Europeans
fi ghting over New Guinea during the Second World War, who had
abundant goods brought in by cargo planes. Th  e fi rst half of Dia-
mond’s book is an illuminating exposition of the importance of the
east- west orientation of the Eurasian land mass, by contrast with the
north- south orientation of Africa and the New World. If chickens
were  domesticated  in  China,  as  they  were,  it  was  easy  for  people
farther west, such as eventually the Spaniards at the other end of the
land mass, to adopt them. Th   e weather was prett  y much the same in
China and Spain. By contrast, corn domesticated in Central America
never made it south to Peru, and potatoes domesticated in the Peru
of the Incas never made it to the Toltec and Mayan civilizations of
Central America. Th  erefore it was the civilizations of the Eurasian

land mass that had the widest array of domestications of wheat and
horses and the rest, and the best chance of having a Great Enrich-
ment leading to the cargo- laden airplanes of Japanese and American
and Australian invaders of New Guinea.
But then Diamond goes off   the rails. Big- time. Th   e second half of
his book deals with the promise of his silly title, explaining what we
already know— that guns and steel in armor and swords, and germs
such as measles and smallpox, made the conquest of the New World
easy. He loses track of what he was trying to explain and starts sup-
posing against the evidence that conquest is what pushes societies
over into real enrichment. It doesn’t, as his very case shows: Portugal
and Spain, the fi  rst overseas imperialists, with colonies from Mexico
to  Macao,  were  on  the  eve  of  the  Great  Enrichment  the  poorest
countries  in  western  Europe,  and  they  did  not  fully  embrace  the
modern economy until the end of the twentieth century.
Empire, in any event, is expensive. As the British Foreign Offi  ce
kept warning during the scramble for Africa, guns are expensive in
housing and education forgone. Th  e British trade in materials and
minerals and tea and spices grew, and a few merchants grew rich, but
such profi  ts were tiny compared with British national income. Trade
with the “periphery” such as Poland was small relative to the trade
of western Europeans with one another. And anyway their foreign
trade was minuscule relative to their internal trade with themselves
(e.g., French people with French people). In 1790, only about 4 per-
cent  of  European  output  was  exported.  Th   e  share  was  smaller  in
- And countries like Sweden with trivial overseas colonies and
Austria with no such colonies got rich, too, and were able to eat ba-
nanas for breakfast— because they traded, not because they raided.
For European economic growth, the trade with the periphery was,
well, peripheral. Th   e terms on which the British exchanged railway
locomotives  for  jute  with  India  would  have  been  about  the  same
had India been independent— unlikely, considering the disorganiza-
tion of the Mughal Empire— or, more likely it might have become
a French colony. In any case, Britain’s exports to India were about a
fi   ft  h of its exports to the United States and Europe. Th   e   collections
at the British Museum would now be diff  erent, doubtless. But a Brit-

ain tending liberal anyway would have waxed rich without seizing
an empire.
And so for other imperialisms. Leopold II of Belgium slaughtered
his way through the Congo, growing rich on rubber suddenly valu-
able for boots and bicycles. No other Belgian benefi ted. Germany’s
dabbling in overseas empire was utt  erly pointless, and the genocide
against the Herero people in Namibia is still vividly remembered a
century on. Th  e Spanish and Portuguese people at home were im-
poverished, not enriched, by their three centuries of empire. Italian
imperialism in Libya and the Horn of Africa might be seen as merely
comical, if the butcher’s bill in Africans and Italians killed were not
added to the balance.

Everybody most everywhere enslaved the Other. Slavery is a com-
mon if horrible human institution. If slavery led to Great Enrichment,
it would have happened in the slave societies of Greece or Rome. It
didn’t. It would have happened in Asia, where “slavery was likewise
common,”  Th   omas  Sowell  observes,  or  China  specifi  cally,  where
“there  [are]  records  of  slavery  going  back  to  1800  B.C.”
## 1
It  would
have happened in Portuguese- speaking Brazil, which received, we
have noted, many more African slaves than North America did. Or
it would have happened along the Barbary coast of Africa and in the
Middle East more generally, where more Europeans were sold into
slavery between 1500 and 1800 than Africans transported to North
America— and where Sowell reports that “14 million African slaves
were  taken  across  the  Sahara  Desert  or  shipped  through  the  Per-
sian Gulf and other waterways to the nations of North Africa and
the Middle East,” compared with some 11 million Africans shipped
across the Atlantic.

Th  e slave markets of Algiers were every bit as
competitive and “capitalist” as the slave markets of Charleston and

It is said that there were large profi ts to be had in the slave trade.
Aft  er all, as Karl Marx put it, “Liverpool waxed fat on the slave-trade.”
Indeed. But slave trading did not have barriers to entry. It is such
barriers that make for supernormal profi  t. A ship is a ship, mobile of
course between uses in Dublin or Dakar. It earns what a ship earns,

regardless of what it carries— a normal, and modest, return, if some
of the cargoes were abnormal and prideful.
And the earnings of slave traders from Newport, Rhode Island,
or Bristol, England, were trivial sources of investment for industri-
alization.
## 3
If the profi ts, such as they were, of the trade are judged
crucial, why not the profi  ts from, say, the pott  ery industry, of similar
magnitude, or from retail trade, much larger? What makes shameful
profi ts more effi  cacious for the Great Enrichment than honorable
ones? (Th   e reason seems to be the desire to see “capitalism” anyway
as born in sin.)
It  is  right  to  note  that,  for  example,  higher  demand  for  cott  on
textiles meant higher demand for raw cott  on and, therefore, higher
demand  for  slaves  to  pick  it.  Similarly,  to  take  an  interesting  case
studied by two left ish historians, higher demand for twine to bale
American wheat straw meant that Mayans and Yaqui Indians in the
Yucatan  were  forced  to  harvest  cactus  to  make  the  twine.
## 4
But  it
does not follow that the exploitation was caused by the bett  erments
in cott on and twine. Th  e existing structure of power that allowed
slavery or other exploitations in the fi rst place is the salient cause,
not the use to which the exploited people were put. At length the
liberal theory that no one should be a slave to anyone, and the Great
Enrichment following, shook the structures of power. Th   at is what
the left  should be celebrating and thinking of ways to encourage.
Instead it stops at blaming “capitalism” for slavery and patriarchy and
other tyrannies, which were in fact relieved by liberalism.
Th   e  African  American  poet  Langston  Hughes  we  have  quoted
sang in the same poem about an imagined America, “Let it be that
great strong land of love / Where never kings connive nor tyrants
scheme  /  Th   at  any  man  be  crushed  by  one  above.”  Th   at   slavery
crushed from above and stole unrequited toil cannot be doubted.
Th   at’s  what  being  a  slave  means.  Yet  the  system  was  accepted  on
all sides until liberalism and Great Enrichment. Being a slave was
viewed as a personal misfortune, of course. Th   e Europeans such as
Robinson Crusoe seized by Barbary pirates could tell you about it, as
could the Frenchmen sentenced to the galleys for importing calico

cloth. But no one, from Aristotle to Daniel Defoe, regarded forced
labor as an evil system. Labor enforced by the lash was common-
place anyway among nominally free European laborers before the
nineteenth century. Wives and apprentices and children and sailors
and the unemployed were routinely beaten. Aft  er all, how are we go-
ing to get our candles lit and our fi replaces tended in the big house,
or get the cott on crop in, without slaves? Th  e answer comes now,
as  Matt    Ridley  puts  it,  by  “enslaving”  coal  and  oil  and  electricity.
Th   e metaphorical enslavement depended on human ideas for com-
mercially tested bett  erment— that is, on innovism. Not coercion.
## §
Yet the contrary case appeals. Listen to the Poet President, and weep
for the decline of political eloquence. In his second inaugural ad-
dress,  carved  now  into  the  north  wall  of  the  memorial,  Abraham
Lincoln declared that “if God wills that [the Civil War] continue
until all the wealth piled by the bondsman’s two hundred and fi ft  y
years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, . . . as was said three thousand
years ago, so still it must be said ‘the judgments of the Lord are true
and righteous altogether.’”
It is a noble sentiment, exhibiting how closely Lincoln read the
Bible as boy and man. He is quoting Psalms 19:9, not an especially
famous verse. But his sentiment about the role of slavery in Ameri-
can wealth aft er 1619 is unwisely if widely credited as literally true
economic  history.  Beyond  the  soaring  theology,  Lincoln’s  words
have been accepted as economics— that American wealth depended
on  slavery.  Th   e  website  of  Teach  US  History  .org  reports  as  fact
that “northern fi nance made the Cott on Kingdom possible, [and]
northern factories required that cott  on,” and so “we can understand
[Lincoln’s theme of ] the War as retribution.” Both North and South,
it says, were entangled in the sin of slavery. Both are said to have
mightily profi  ted from it, and the blood judgments against both are
righteous altogether.
Th   e belief has been reanimated recently in books widely admired
on the left , constituting a King Cott on school of US history: Wal-

ter  Johnson’s  River  of  Dark  Dreams  (2013),  Sven  Beckert’s  Empire
of Cott on: A Global History (2014), and especially Edward Baptist’s
Th   e  Half  Has  Never  Been  Told:  Slavery  in  the  Making  of  American
Capitalism (2014). Th  e rise of “capitalism” depended, they claim,
on the making of cott on cloth in Manchester, England, and Man-
chester, New Hampshire, and the making depended on raw cott  on
raised in the South. And the growing of Southern cott  on, they claim,
depended on slavery. Conclusion, as our good friends on the left
have been saying all these years: “Capitalism” was conceived in sin.
Th  e King Cott on historians are off ering an analysis of original sin
alternative to Marx’s claim of the original accumulation from piracy,
or Friedrich Engels’s of the exploitation of the English working class,
or Eric Williams’s of the profi  ts from the international slave trade, or
the still fashionable claim, fi  rst made by John Hobson and Vladimir
Lenin a century ago, of the profi  ts from imperialism. On the left    the
game is Spot the Original Sin.
But each step in the King Cott on school’s story is mistaken. In
place of economic sense, the story substitutes a warm indignation
against the peculiar institution. Needless to say, along with other
bourgeois  liberals,  we  join  the  school  in  its  indignation.  But  its
economics is plain silly. Th  e enrichment of the modern world did
not depend on cott  on textiles. Th   e   cott  on mills of the United States
and of Europe, true, pioneered certain industrial techniques, but so
did other sectors, such as, among fabrics themselves, wool, linen,
silk,  and  jute.  And  an  economy  is  not  a  fabric  mill.  Widespread
ingenuity—  Yankee  clock  making  and  British  iron  making  and
French porcelain making— was the ticket to modernity.
And making cott on cloth did not depend on Southern supplies
of cott  on. During the cott  on famine of the Civil War, supplies from
Egypt started to replace the South’s. Had the war continued until
all the wealth said to be piled up by the bondsman’s labor was sunk,
Egypt and India and Jamaica could have supplied the cott  on  with
ease. Only in the short run is an existing region of supply “necessary.”
Th   e King Cott  on historians depend on the supply- chain fallacy, that
if a supply chain is ever interrupted, the game is up— there are no
possible substitutes. All links are claimed to be necessary. Such non-

## 126
## *
chapter  18
economic economics inspired, for example, the strategic bombing
in World War II and then in Vietnam. It was ethically repulsive, and
it didn’t work on German industry any bett er than on the Ho Chi
Minh Trail. Such quasi logic doesn’t forge a chain of necessity from
slave- grown  cott  on to modern industry because there are substitutes
everywhere.
Furthermore,  growing  cott  on  did  not  depend  on  slavery.  Th   e
historical facts are conclusive on the point. Before the Civil War,
both whites and the few free blacks grew cott  on. By 1870 whites and
former slaves, despite a massive withdrawal of freed women from
fi  eld work, grew as much cott  on as the South had before the bomb-
ing of Fort Sumter. To be sure, sugar, historically speaking, was a
slave crop wherever it was grown, in Syria, Cyprus, the Canaries, and
the New World. But cott  on never was chiefl y a slave crop, in India,
for instance, or in southwest China, where it was grown in bulk from
ancient times.
Baptist  and  the  other  King  Cott  oners  are  mostly  innocent  of
economics and economic history. Th   at would not be blameworthy
if slavery were not an economic institution, as it was, and if a large
historical literature had not grown up in the mid-  to late twentieth
century, as it did, sett  ing the economic record straight. Among oth-
ers, Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman wrote Time  on  the  Cross
in  1974  and  follow-  up  books  and  articles  aplenty.  From  the  King
Cott  on  texts  and  bibliographies,  one  would  hardly  know  it.  Th   e
King Cott  oners think, for example, that owning a slave constituted
“cheap labor.” But as Fogel and Engerman, Richard Sutch, and all
the economists and some historians such as Kenneth Stampp noted,
the productivity was capitalized into the market price of a slave. If
you owned a slave, you faced the opportunity cost of the alternative
use of the labor, net of maintenance costs. No supernormal profi ts
accrued to people who bought slaves, so to speak, secondhand, or
raised them expensively from babies. What profi ts that didn’t dis-
sipate accrued to the fi rsthanders, chiefl y within Africa.

Th   e King Cott  on school has been devastated in detail by two eco-
nomic historians, Alan Olmstead and Paul Rhode. Th   eir   revelations
are startling.
## 6
Th   ey point out that the share of slaves in US wealth is

grossly exaggerated by the inequality maven Th   omas   Pikett  y,  whose
pseudoestimates are used by Baptist to put slavery into the center
of  the  country’s  economic  history.  And  Olmstead  and  Rhode,  in
line with their own research on the cott on economy of the South,
note that the locus of improvement driving up the price of slaves
was not more extreme abuse of slaves but an astonishing rise in the
productivity  of  the  cott  on  plant,  achieved  by  selective  breeding.
Slavery was extraordinarily evil, we now all agree. But slavery was
not extraordinarily profi table.
Abolition, and the end of routine beating, came from people like
the Quaker abolitionist John Newton, a former slave- trading captain
and author of the hymn “Amazing Grace”; and William Wilberforce,
son and grandson of prosperous merchants of Hull; and Julia Ward
Howe, author of “Th   e   Batt  le Hymn of the Republic” and the daugh-
ter of a stockbroker. See the patt  ern? “Capitalists” and their off  spring
ended slavery.
Yet again we say: ingenuity, not exploitation, is the story of the
modern world. It would be a good idea to stop using, for present- day
politics against “capitalism,” a faux history of slavery, whether by a
hard left   in many distinguished departments of history nowadays or
a generously soft    left  and middle piously persuaded by the harder
folk. Slavery was bad enough without ornamenting it with bad his-
tory and bad economics.

You  may  say,  “Surely  it  was  the  labor  movement  that  ended  or  at
least  sharply  curtailed  the  capitalists’  ruthless  exploitation  of  the
industrial proletariat.”
No, not at all. And more generally, the distributive struggles don’t
do the explanatory job. Th   ey are zero- sum explanations for the larg-
est positive- sum change in economic history. And the negative- sum
possibilities from the labor struggle are well illustrated by British
labor relations during the 1970s.
Real wages and working conditions for workers rose because labor
became much more productive, on account of commercially tested
bett  erments in fi  eld and factory, not because laborers extracted con-
cessions from the bosses. Labor histories and their splendid songs
are fi  lled with accounts of literal violence between miners and scabs
or, from the other side, the copper bosses framing and executing Joe
Hill. Yet the economics is clear. Th   e bosses have resisted unionization,
oft en fruitlessly. Walmart resisted it and incurred the enmity of the
left  , but competitive labor markets in retail meant they had to adjust
the wages and working conditions they off ered because they were
competing with other unionized retailers. If they didn’t, the workers
would walk. On the other side, a union’s “fi ght” and “struggle” for a
larger share of the economic pie, if successful, damages nonunion
labor, which has been in the United States a larger group. If unions
meant higher wages and bett er working conditions for coal miners,
## 19

## 129
then necessarily, unless magic intervenes, it meant higher prices for
coal users. Unions in steel and autos and government and trucking
do the same. Mc Closkey’s uncle Joe, a union electrician in Michigan,
gladly paid union wages because, as he said, he could pass the expense
on to his customers. But who pays the higher building costs? You.
And in any case, the gain to unionized workers has been small.
Th   e economist H. Gregg Lewis in careful studies over many decades
found that the most successful unions raised wages perhaps 15 per-
cent.
## 1
Th   at’s not 3,000 percent. And a multi- industrial union like the
Teamsters (Mc Closkey belonged happily to a professors’ union, part
of the Teamsters’ assemblage) has much smaller eff  ects on wages, a
few percentage points, regularly off set by worsened conditions of
employment. Truck drivers get a tiny boost in pay but drive more
hours at a stretch.
It was the point that Adam Smith made long ago about the sum of
wages plus the money value of conditions. For the same level of skill
in the worker, the sum has to be roughly the same in all parts of the
economy. Otherwise the workers in a disfavored part move away to
the favored part, until the samensss is reestablished. Th   ey walk. Th   us
African Americans moved north in the Great Migration. Th   us   you
yourself leave a well- paying job with too- long hours. A taxi driver
earns less than a coal miner because the conditions in coal mining
are worse— more dirty and exhausting and dangerous— conditions
for which the coal miner gets compensated in cash. It’s not because
it’s just but because it is a natural equilibrium if people are free to
move. Wages and conditions, like water, fi nd their own level, not
mysteriously but by the most ordinary behavior of people. In an ar-
gument typical of economic thinking, Smith noted that people will
crowd into the good wage- and- conditions occupation, driving down
wages there, until the equality of wages- plus- conditions is reestab-
lished. Economists use the fi  nancial word to describe the point: arbi-
trage. It’s why professors, whose technology has not changed since
Socrates, nonetheless earn about the same as airline pilots, whose
technology compared with ancient Greek ship pilots is thousands of
times more productive of travel. A prospective professor who didn’t

like the pay and conditions could go to fl  ight school instead of grad
school.  Enough  slide  from  occupation  to  occupation  to  keep  the
water roughly at its own level.
Smith’s theorem implies that the Democratic Party’s pressure to
improve working conditions, or the Republican Party’s resistance, is
lacking in point. Th   e sum of wages and the money value of working
conditions is determined by the supply of and demand for labor, in
the same way that rent of lett  uce- growing land close to or far from
the city is determined by the crop yield net of the cost of transport-
ing the lett  uce to the city. And so it is for any “factor” of production,
as economists call them: labor in mining and cab driving, or land in
farming and suburban housing, or physical capital in factories and
houses and machines. Th  eir total compensation, economists have
realized  since  the  1870s—  and  have  shown  factually  in  thousands
of studies— depends on the output of the last unit of labor, land, or
capital applied, known as the “marginal product.” Not bargaining
strength.
Th  e contrary theory, inspiring politics left  and right, is that the
bosses have a pile of gold in the back room that can be extracted
endlessly by struggles on the picket line or in Congress, which will
make workers bett  er  off   on net, both in pay and in conditions. If true,
it would be wonderful. Pass a law, and make workers vastly bett  er  off  .
Carden and Mc Closkey would be delighted.
But extraction from fairy gold is not how workers have become
bett  er  off  by 3,000 percent. Skillful bargaining might raise the wage
of workers in a tire factory in Ohio by 5 or even 10 percent above
what it would have been. One and done. But marginal productivity
governs the 1,000 to 3,000 to 10,000 percent to be explained. Clearly,
there isn’t enough profi t in the economy— 10 to 15 percent of na-
tional income— to even double wages by way of expropriating the
gold of the expropriators, much less to increase wages by a factor of
thirty. And in any case the gold- in- the- back- room theory assumes
against all likelihood that the expropriated bosses will stand there
and continue to invest in the factory, though they get less profi t in
return. Th   e shareholders forced to accept a trim today will not wait

to get another next year. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice,
shame on me.
Consider coal mining, in the old country tune sung by Johnny
Cash, Willie Nelson, and others, “Where it’s dark as a dungeon and
damp as the dew, / Where the dangers are double and the pleasures
are few.” In isolated coal mining towns the miners were said to owe
their souls to the company store. It’s said to be a classic example of
the Peabody Coal Company using market power, both as demander
of  labor  and  as  supplier  of  housing  and  groceries.  Th   e   company
could  skimp  on  wages  and  working  conditions.  So  it  is  said.  But
it’s mistaken. Th  e wages of miners in Appalachia in fact compared
favorably to what could be earned in hardscrabble agriculture there.
Th   at’s why men went down the mine. Prices were higher at company
stores  than  at  independent  stores,  but  the  company  store  off  ered
bett er credit, bett er selection, and bett er delivery. Consistent with
Smith’s theorem, there was a trade- off  between wages and working
conditions,  with  more  dangerous  jobs  in  more  dangerous  mines
paying more.

As to the left ’s claim that any employment, slave or “free,” simply
is exploitation, the other Marx— the comedian Groucho Marx—
had something to say. At the height of his success in movies in the
1930s, an old Communist friend of his came by and said, “Groucho,
I desperately need a job. You have contacts.” Groucho, whose sense
of humor was oft en cruel, replied, “Harry, I can’t. You’re my dear
Communist friend. I don’t want to ‘exploit’ you.” And sent him away.
Th   e   left  ish usage and its politics echo down to the present, as in
Th  e Concise Oxford Dictionary. It defi nes wage slave coolly as “a per-
son who is wholly dependent on income from employment,” with
the notation “informal”— but not “jocular” or, bett  er,  “economically
illiterate.” Th  us Judy Pearsall, the editor of the 1999 edition of the
Concise Oxford, who lived, it may be, in a nice semidetached in Lon-
don NW6 and drove an old Peugeot, was a “slave.” You yourself are

probably a slave. Carden and Mc Closkey certainly are. All paid work-
ers are slaves— though all are paid in proportion to the traded value
of the goods and services they help produce for others, and none of
them owes unpaid, coerced service to anyone. Th  e alternative job
may  be  wretched,  but  the  “wage  slave”  does  have  the  alternative,
as a real slave does not. No boss in a labor market in a free country
can use coercion to keep a worker from walking. So it is in any free
economy— with the large exception, as Robert Higgs and Carden
and Mc Closkey and many other liberals observe, of slavery to the
government, through taxation or draft  .  Th   at   is a literal slavery. Try
not paying your taxes. Try evading a military draft  . Yet slavery by the
government is admired by most of the left   and by much of the right,
in terms that echo defensive Southern rhetoric in favor of slavery in
1860: “Th  e slaves need our guidance, and we make them work by
coercion. For the good of the slaves, you understand.”
Th   e labor songs are glorious. “Th   ey say in Harlan Country / Th   ere
are no neutrals there. / You either are a union man / Or a scab for
J. H. Blair.” Mc Closkey claims to know more such songs than any
of her socialist or labor- union friends. She taught them to her col-
leagues on the picket line of the Union of Faculty at the University of
Illinois at Chicago. But the history and the economics of the songs,
with their claim that struggle is what enriched the workers, are mis-
taken. We do really wish that laws and strikes could raise the real
wage  to  the  startling  degree  that  commercially  tested  bett  erment
has. But they haven’t.

Enough already of nots.
What  did  it?  Why,  of  all  sad  places,  did  the  Great  Enrichment
start in the dysfunctional backwater of northwestern Europe rather
than in the cultivated Italian peninsula, or the treasure- rich Iberian
peninsula, or the innovative caliphates of the Islamic Middle East,
or the commercial empires of South and East Asia or Africa or the

Answer: A combination of happy accidents, we have said, begin-
ning  in  1517  led  ordinary  people  and  their  rulers  in  northwestern
Europe to revalue the bourgeoisie and embrace dissent with modi-
fi cation. Th   e bourgeoisie itself did not become greedier, or thrift  ier,
or more hardworking, or more law- abiding. Th   e “bourgeois virtue”
in the title of Mc Closkey’s 2006 treatise does claim, as we have said,
that  the  bourgeoisie  is  not  especially  evil.  But  it  did  not  say—  as,
for  example,  the  great  German  sociologist  Max  Weber  did  say  in
1905 about the same history— that a psychological or ethical change
came over the bourgeoisie that made for enrichment. No.
What  happened,  rather,  was  the  coming,  as  in  the  title  of  Mc-
Closkey’s 2010 volume on the matt  er, of a “bourgeois dignity.” In the
eyes of the rest of the society, businesspeople acquired a new dig-
nity. And in the eighteenth century the dignity began a long career,
in the new liberalism, of application to all commoners, the “third
estate” beyond aristocrats and priests— everyone from manservant

to manufacturer. Th   e outcome was, as the title of Mc Closkey’s 2016
volume puts it, “bourgeois equality” for all. An enrichment of all, in
matt er and in soul, rapidly came, and will come— as we have said
many  times  now,  and  given  evidence  of,  and  as  is  argued  in  Mc-
Closkey’s political book of 2019, Why Liberalism Works.
Litt  le  “effl    orescences,” as the historical sociologist Jack Goldstone
has called them, had long come from litt  le fl ashes of pro- bourgeois
ideology,  in  the  northern  Italian  cities  of  Venice,  Florence,  and
Genoa, for example, or seventeenth- century Osaka, Japan, or Car-
thage two centuries before Christ, or ancient “Tyre, the city of batt  le-
ments,  whose  merchants  were  princes,  and  her  traders  the  most
honored men on earth” (Isaiah 23:8).
## 1
But they burned out quickly.
Th   e four Rs— reading, reformation, revolt, and revolution— assured
that aft er 1700 or so, a pro- bourgeois ideology more than fl ashed
in northwestern Europe, and especially in formerly pro- aristocratic
## England.
Innovism, we have noted, led to great enrichment of the com-
moners. Competition in the third act erodes profi  ts. Th   e social gain
from creativity ends up in the hands of customers, to the tune of
98 percent. Th  e 98 percent, and the 2 percent left  in the third act
to  the  innovators,  are  rough  estimates  by  the  economist  William
Nordhaus (winner of a Nobel Prize in 2018).
## 2
To be sure, 2 percent
of the value of changes to how people make and buy and sell is quite
a lot, as you can see in the $143.1 billion net worth of Amazon’s Jeff
Bezos and the combined net worth of almost $175 billion of Sam
Walton’s heirs. But even if one supposes that Nordhaus’s estimate
of the share left  to the innovators as against the rest of us is off    by
a factor of ten, and the customers only get 80 percent of the value
Bezos created by revolutionizing online shopping and that Walton
created by revolutionizing brick- and- mortar shopping, 80 percent of
the bett  erment is still an enormous sum coming to ordinary people
out  of  commercially  tested  bett  erment.  Furthermore,  Bezos  and
Walton got their fortunes by dealing rather than stealing, in contrast
to the fortunes accumulated by anointed kings or modern tyrants.

very rich, but by stealing, not dealing, by taking from others, not by
making them bett  er  off .
Bezos  and  Walton  are  not  sinless.  We  as  economists  object  to
Amazon  having  a  patent  monopoly  on  the  very  idea  of  one-  click
shopping. And we object when Walmart gets a sweetheart deal from
local politicians eager to att  ract sales- tax revenue for the uses of the
politicians. Th   at is, we liberal economists don’t like overlong patents
(“intellectual  property”  is  regarded  by  us  as  mostly  an  antisocial
confi dence game run by patent lawyers). And we don’t like most
political as against commercial allocations of rights. But we invite
all you people without sin to cast the fi rst stone, and then to open
a “discount city” cheapo store in Rogers, Arkansas, in 1962, or an
online bookstore in 1994 in Bellevue, Washington.
Most criticism of Walmart and Amazon comes because they are
commercially successful— a criticism fed also by an irrational and
specifi cally American objection to well- earned bigness per se. Th   e
animus does not come because they are politically successful. We
doubt therefore that the criticism would change much if Amazon did
not have a patent on one- click shopping or if Walmart did not some-
times  get  special  treatment  in  local  taxes.  (Walmart  actually,  and
somewhat imprudently, didn’t develop a Washington presence until
the government threatened the free international trade on which
its business success has been built. Th   e corruption originated from
Washington, DC, not from Bentonville, Arkansas.)
## §
Th  e Bourgeois Deal has competed during the past couple of cen-
turies with four other Deals for organizing society. Th  e other four
substitute coercion for cooperation, the government for the market,
the visible hand for the invisible hand, top- down for bott  om-  up:  the
Blue- Blood Deal, the Bolshevik Deal, the Bismarckian Deal, and the
Bureaucratic Deal. Although oft en popular at the outset, the four
have regularly consigned humans to poverty and slaughter (Blue-
Blood and Bolshevik) or to weights around the ankles of innovators
and illusory promises of security (Bureaucratic and Bismarckian).

## 138
## *
chapter  20
Th   e Blue- Blood Deal, or what Mc Closkey calls in her 2016 book
the Aristocratic Deal, honors the blood of noble birth. It says, “In
the fi rst act and in the second, pay your land rents promptly, and
curtsey or bow low as I ride by. And go to war to die in batt  le for my
glory and my gain. By the third act, I at least will not have slaughtered
you.” True, aft  er a noble property is established, the use of it will be
effi  cient if the property is exchangeable. So much does economics
affi  rm, contrary to the labor- input justifi cation of property in John
Locke’s writings. But in deep origin the Blue- Blood Deal is of course
a protection racket. When in 1969 the great economist John Hicks
wrote on the basis of slender reading A Th  eory of Economic History,
arguing that the aristocrats were “protecting” their serfs, the great
economic  historian  Alexander  Gerschenkron  observed  that  “the
possibility that the main, if not the only, danger against which the
peasant very frequently was in need of protection was the very lord
is not mentioned.”
## 3
Th   e Blue- Blood Deal claims to reject mere com-
mercial bett erment tested by vulgar profi t and loss— though very
willing to seize the profi t. It embraces bett  erment only in machines
of  war  tested  in  noble  bloodshed.  Th   e  nobility  was  protected  for
centuries from swords and arrows by steel plate armor and was at
last creatively destroyed by the crossbow and longbow and at length
the matchlock.
Th  e Bolshevik Deal, like the Blue- Blood Deal, makes the bour-
geoisie an off er it can’t refuse. Th  e surface mott o, stemming from
Karl  Marx,  is  “from  each  according  to  his  ability,  to  each  accord-
ing to his need.” Sounds nice: note again the imitation of a family’s
ethic, to be applied, as Lenin once said, to a great national factory. As
George Orwell’s masterful pigs said in Animal Farm, all animals are
equal, but some animals are more equal than others: “Do your as-
signed task, turn over the fruits of your labor for distribution by the
Communist Party, and above all do not criticize the party. We will
make all economic decisions for you. Do not ask for equality with
high- level party functionaries. Obey in the fi rst act and also in the
second, and by the third act we will at least not have liquidated you.”
An anti- Bolshevik alternative to the Bourgeois Deal is the Bis-
marckian Deal, which was inaugurated in 1881 under the Iron Chan-

cellor, Ott o von Bismarck, and triumphant aft er 1889, the fi rst year
of old- age pensions in the German Empire. Ludwig von Mises put
Bismarck “among the nineteenth century statesmen the foremost foe
of liberty.”
## 4
Th   e Bismarckian Deal was a buyoff  , bribing the poor to
behave themselves. Bismarck’s explicit plan was to steal the thunder
of his enemies— that is, of the soon- to- be- literally Bolshevik Deal-
ers, and of the left   generally, and of the liberals, too. Th   e   Bismarckian
Deal is the modern welfare state. In Britain it dates from 1911, with
compulsory unemployment insurance. In the United States it dates
from 1933 and the New Deal. Th   e Bismarckian Deal says, “In acts one
and two you should come to view the present government as your
noble and benevolent lord, forsaking family and the institutions of
civil society that so imperfectly and ineffi    ciently provide for old- age
care and emergency medical care. By the third act we will at least
have protected you from the Bolsheviks and the bourgeoisie.”
Th  e Bismarckian Deal has worked splendidly as propaganda, if
not so well in practice. Private contributions to British universities,
for  example,  largely  dried  up  aft  er  the  government  took  over  the
universities aft er World War I.
## 5
On the eve of the British National
(Unemployment) Insurance Act of 1911, of the 12 million then to be
covered by the act, fully 9 million already had voluntary arrange-
ments, especially through “friendly societies.”
## 6
Th   e same was true in
the United States, where voluntary provision of health insurance was
robust.
## 7
(Note the parallels in today’s debate in the US about health
insurance.) Bismarck’s welfare state crowded out private saving for
old age, higher education, health care, and other private projects of
free adults.
## 8
Th  e Bismarckian Deal asks (or more exactly compels)
people to forsake the animation of a free adult life and become chil-
dren of the government— and reliable voters for the Bismarckians.
In the US it has yielded a powerful voting block of elderly pensioners
promising reprisals to any politician who dares touch Medicare or
Social Security. (Mc Closkey gives earnest thanks to younger people
for paying her health care— two hip replacements, fi  xing a burst ul-
cer, removal of her gallbladder. She gets Social Security, too. Th   anks
again, and remember that she votes.)
Th   e fourth alternative to our liberal Bourgeois Deal is the Burea-

ucratic Deal, which sits alongside elements of each of the others. It
embraces the private property of the Bourgeois Deal and rejects the
mass murder of the Bolshevik Deal. So far, so good. It is the Deal
off ered by the administrative state— bett erment by permission, in
contrast to the permissionless bett erment of the Bourgeois Deal.
## 9

In  a  brilliant  book  on  the  US  history  of  administering  of  the  air-
waves, from wireless Guglielmo Marconi to wireless Steve Jobs, the
economist Th   omas W. Hazlett   labels the Federal Communications
Commission’s  administrative  rule,  “Mother,  may  I  innovate?”
## 10
## It
rules over the benighted commoners and bourgeoisie through an
aristocracy of experts— who, as Hazlett  demonstrates in detail, do
not actually know what they are doing when denying or accepting
the request of Mother- may- I. Th   e outcome was decades- long stagna-
tion in technology, as for example in FM radio. Mc Closkey recently
met a young entrepreneur in an industry dependent on computer
technology who told her that the way he escaped the Bureaucratic
Deal was to stay ahead of the bureaucrats in computer technology,
explaining, “If they don’t understand what you’re doing, you can do
it.” For the massive benefi t of customers in retail stores.
Th   e  Bureaucratic  Deal,  which  is  notoriously  loquacious  in  its
rulemaking, says, “Fine, sell tacos out of a truck. But before you do
that, make sure you have the right answers to all our Mother- may- I
questions. Do you have the right permissions from the taxing au-
thorities? Do you have the appropriate licenses for your truck? Will
you be within fi ve hundred feet of a brick- and- mortar restaurant?
Do you and the people who will do the cooking for you have all the
right cards, green and others, granting them our gracious permis-
sion to be gainfully employed? Does the local Taco Vendor Licens-
ing Board— staff ed, of course, by representatives from expert and
already- existing taco vendors— agree that our city needs another
place to buy tacos? Are your methods acceptably environmentally
friendly, as judged by us experts? Are you thinking of serving soft
drinks in 24- ounce cups? Or giving your customers plastic straws?
Or cooking with trans fats? Or handing people larger orders in plas-
tic bags? All of this, of course, is for the protection of the consumers
and workers you are shamelessly trying to poison or exploit.”

Th   e three- act drama of the Bureaucratic Deal, reprised in tens of
thousands of pages of regulations it adds each year, continues so:
“Honor me, an expert by possession of a master’s degree, and give
me the power to tax and regulate you in the fi rst act, and also in the
second, and all subsequent acts. I forbid you under penalty of the
laws (which we experts write) from seeking a bett er deal, such as
moving your factory to Mexico, shift  ing your money to the Cayman
Islands,  operating  your  business  without  a  governmental  license
(which  I  give  out),  or  working  for  less  than  a  decreed  minimum
(which I determine). If you follow my orders and keep paying your
taxes, then by the third and subsequent acts I will at least not have
jailed you.” We told you this Deal was loquacious.
## §
Th   e Bourgeois Deal replies to the Blue- Bloods and Bolsheviks and
Bismarckians and Bureaucrats: “Mind your own business.” Or as Ayn
Rand’s character John Galt says in Atlas Shrugged when asked for a
plan to get the economy going, “Get the hell out of my way!” Th   e
Bourgeois Deal says that the taco truck entrepreneur is accountable
to the bankers who fi  nance her venture, the employees and suppliers
who help her do it, and the customers who vote with dollars for or
against her tacos, earned as the fruits of their own labors for still other
people. Th   e bureaucratic regulation that claims to protect consum-
ers (but regularly protects traditional interests from competition, as
in Germany does prohibition of Uber in favor of traditional taxis) is
in fact much worse at consumer protection than is an aroused public
opinion in a free society. A restaurant that in 1997 was ground zero
for a shigella outbreak in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, did not last long.
Carden still associates the name of another restaurant— which he
has never patronized— with an E. coli outbreak that originated there
when he was in the sixth grade. On mentioning the example to an
audience of high schoolers, Carden was brought up to date about
still another restaurant that had a similar outbreak— and where the
Cardens are now unlikely to dine. A notifi  cation from the Nextdoor
app tells a neighbor’s story about a company not to use because it did

shoddy work. An episode of South Park lampoons the importance of
Yelp reviewers. Th   ey are examples of the market working in a society
with  free  speech—  imperfectly,  but  working,  and  regularly  bett  er
than the inspectors of the Bureaucratic Deal can deliver.
Th  e common honesty of a society of merchants in fact goes be-
yond what would be strictly self- interested in a society of rats, as one
can see in that much- maligned model of the mercantile society, the
small midwestern city. A reputation for fair dealing is necessary for a
roofer whose trade is limited to a city of fi ft  y thousand. A professor
at the University of Iowa refused to tell at a cocktail party the name
of a roofer in Iowa City who had at fi rst done a bad job for her (he
redid the job free, at his own instigation) because the roofer would
be fi nished in town if his name got out in such a connection. Th   e
professor’s behavior itself shows that ethical habits can harden into
ethical convictions, the way a child grows from fear of punishment
toward consulting an impartial spectator within the breast. An un-
ethical person would have told the name of the roofer to spice up
the story. Aft er all, the professor’s own reputation in business was
not at stake.
No  society  embodies  one  or  another  Deal  to  the  exclusion  of
all  the  others.  Mc  Closkey’s  Sweet  Home  Chicago  and  Carden’s
Sweet  Home  Alabama  mix  Bourgeois-  Dealing  innovism  and
Bolshevik(- ish)-  Dealing of socialized control of the means of edu-
cational production under the auspices of a Bureaucratic- Dealing
license  raj,  a  Bismarckian-  Dealing  welfare  state,  and  Blue-  Blood-
Dealing political machines. Life is imperfect. But since 1800, it has
managed to get enough of the Bourgeois Deal to produce a Great
## Enrichment.

We are left  ,  aft  er eliminating the other candidates on off  er, with the
one explanation, the only one that fi ts the timeline and fi ts the ge-
ography and fi  ts the human lives involved. In short, people changed
their ideas about what is lovely in economic life.
To put it economically, they reduced what Don Boudreaux calls
the “dishonor tax” on merchants.

chapter  21
Elite talk about bett  erment, profi  t, and commercial tests changed
from around 1300 to 1600 in parts of northern Italy, the southern
Low Countries, and the Hanseatic towns. It changed more decisively
down to about 1648 in Holland, and then aft  er 1689 in England, and
then aft  er 1707 in Scotland, and before 1776 in Britain’s North Ameri-
can colonies, and still more broadly down to 1848 all over northwest-
ern Europe and its neighbors and off  shoots. In England the change
occurred during a concentrated, and startling, period from 1690 to
- Th  e rhetorical and ideological change in western Europe was
such that the article on government in the French Encyclopedia of
1751– 1766 declared that “the good of the people must be the great
purpose of government.”
## 4
It was a sharp alteration from the honor-
seeking or frankly extractive justifi cations of earlier governments,
in which the glory of the king ruled and the great purpose was far
from the good of the mere people. King “Harry” of England in act
3,  scene  1  of  Shakespeare’s  1599  play  Henry  V urged on his troops
before Harfl  eur in 1415 with “Cry ‘God for Harry, England, and Saint
George!’” Not “Cry God for the economic good of the people in
GDP per head!”
Talk,  the  habits  of  the  lip,  matt  ered,  and  does  still.  In  England
between 1690 and 1720, and still more so down to 1848, ideas and
talk about trade, statistics, bett  erment, and bourgeois life changed.
Th   e four so- called pagan virtues of courage, justice, temperance, and
prudence and the three so- called Christian virtues of faith, hope,
and love, as Mc Closkey argued at length in Th  e Bourgeois Virtues,
apply with suitable modifi cation to a bourgeois as much as to an
aristocratic or religious society. Th   ey appeared in a rhetoric of pru-
dent calculation of costs and benefi ts, and a hopeful att  itude  toward
industrial  novelties  tested  by  commerce,  and  a  just,  nonenvious,
acceptance of ethically acquired profi ts. Honor always matt  ers  to
humans (that “faith”), but what was honorable changed.
Outside northwestern Europe the Revaluation happened much
later. Right down to the Meiji Restoration of 1868, aft er which the
rhetoric in Japan changed startlingly quickly, elite opinion scorned
the merchant. (And yet a samurai conception of honor came back a
half century later in Japanese militarism.) In Japanese Confucianism

the ranking from top to bott  om had been the emperor (recovering his
position in 1868), the shogun (1603– 1868), the daimyos, the samurai,
the peasants, the craft  smen,  the merchants, the night- soil men, and
last of all Koreans. A merchant in East Asia was not a “gentleman,”
to use the European word, and had no honor. He might have periods
of comparative liberty, as in the lightening of legal restrictions dur-
ing the Song dynasty of China (860– 1279). But he did not have the
dignity of the landlord and the general and the imperial offi  cial. So
too England in 1689. But not for much longer.
Ethics, not laws, are fundamental. We agree again with Alexis de
Tocqueville: “I accord institutions [he meant laws] only a secondary
infl uence on the destiny of men. . . . Political societies are not what
the laws make them, but what sentiments, beliefs, ideas, habits of
the heart [in his famous phrase from Democracy in America], and
the spirit of the men who form them prepare them in advance to
be. . . . Th   e sentiments, the ideas, the mores [French les mœurs], alone
can lead to public prosperity and liberty.”
## 5
Th  e practical politician
Lincoln put it this way, in the fi rst of the Lincoln- Douglas debates
of 1858: “With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing
can  succeed.  Consequently  he  who  molds  public  sentiment  goes
deeper  than  he  who  enacts  statutes  or  pronounces  decisions.  He
makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed.”

Th  e codes of conduct to which she adheres are not simply matt  ers

She  does  what  she  does,  and  doesn’t  do  what  she  doesn’t  do,
because as an adult and a professional woman, she has formed by
upbringing and self- criticism and the infl uences of her culture an
ethical identity, a faith, what Adam Smith called the “impartial spec-
tator within the breast.” Institutions absent such an ethic, however
clever their laws, don’t work: “Political societies are not what the
laws  make  them.”  Th   e  neo-  institutionalists  Daron  Acemoglu  and

chapter  21
James  Robinson  report  on  an  att  empt  in  India  to  curb  absentee-
ism among hospital nurses by introducing the institution of time
clocks. Th   e economists in charge of the att empt were sure that the
bare incentives of law, the “right institution,” would work. It didn’t.
Th   e nurses conspired with their bosses in the hospitals to share their
salaries, and they continued not showing up for work. Acemoglu and
Robinson draw a moral that “the institutional structure that creates
market failures” is what went wrong. But the continuing absenteeism
was not about institutions or incentives or laws. A new institution
with the right incentives had been confi  dently applied by the econo-
mists out of the tool kit of orthodoxy of the World Bank, and had
failed. Acemoglu and Robinson do not see that what failed was the
prudence- only theory of the economics profession: add institutions
and stir. “Th   e root cause of the problem,” they assert, was “extractive
institutions.”
## 7
No, it wasn’t. Th   e failure was rather about the lack of
an  ethics  of  self-  respecting  professionalism  among  the  nurses,  of
a  sort  that,  say,  Filipino  nurses  do  have,  which  is  why  they  are  in
demand worldwide.
Contrary to what is commonly believed, ethical convictions can
and do change quickly. Consider the women’s movement and the
resulting change in labor force participation during the 1960s.

Progressive Era around 1900, much of labor law and regulation on

reality is supposed to be “two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom
make water” (but what about heavy water?), and an incontestable
subjective fact is supposed to be “my favorite color is green” (but what
about cultural variation in what is called green?). Th   ese   so-   called
facts are said to be not up for debate, or not much.
In a 1994 book, Mc Closkey coined the word “conjective” to de-
scribe, however, the numerous facts that are accepted socially but are
neither objective nor subjective in the philosophically naive sense
that people usually employ.
## 10
Th   e conjective describes the extremely
large area between what is objectively true and what is subjectively
true. It is, for example, where the scientifi  c action is, on the frontiers.
F = ma might be seen as objective (but what about at the speed of
light?). Th   e present (lack of ) understanding of dark matt  er and dark
energy is not.
Social consensus is at the heart of the conjective, in science as
much as in courts of law or in family gatherings at Th   anksgiving.
A person, a thing, or an entity does its linguistic job by virtue of a
social agreement. Th  e philosopher John Searle has called it by the
somewhat odd phrase a “status function”: “X is treated as Y in con-
text C.”
## 11
A piece of paper is called a $20 bill when it is issued by the
Federal Reserve Bank. Language creates the meanings of X, Y, and
C, and these are up for negotiation. Conjective.
For instance, people have through trial and error created a game
called  soccer.  Consider:  when  a  specifi  c  part  of  the  soccer  ball
“crosses” a specifi c line in the context of a soccer game, it is called
a “goal.” Similarly, an att acker is “off side” if she is between the last
defender and the goalie just as the ball is kicked to her. Th   ese   are
facts, but facts by social consensus as to what the context “soccer”
entails. If enough people are unhappy with the rules promulgated
by the Fédération Internationale de Football, they can form their
own association with their own rules and change the conversation
about what “soccer” is.
Sports rules and their evolution are particularly obvious examples
of conjective facts, changed by way of dissent with modifi  cation. Dis-
senters from the way basketball was played in the National Basket-
ball Association started the American Basketball Association and

introduced the three- point shot, which was ultimately adopted by
the NBA itself aft er the two leagues merged. Farther back, rugby
emerged at Rugby School in England when someone decided that
soccer might be more interesting if you could pick up the ball and
run with it, as was in fact the rule in the lethal intervillage games
of  the  Middle  Ages  from  which  all  the  kicking-  and-  running  ball
games descend. Other dissenters modifi ed the medieval or Rugby
rules and created Gaelic, Canadian, Australian, and American ver-
sions of football. Is an off ensive player allowed to run toward the
line of scrimmage before the ball is snapped? Th  e answer is yes if
the context is “Canadian football” and no if the context is American
football. Objective? No, conjective, by consensus.
And that is the world in which we fi  nd ourselves, a world in which
consensus and conversation are massively determinative of what we
do, and can change, as they did about the economy in England aft  er
- Th   e brain scientist Raymond Tallis described it this way:
We  belong  to  a  boundless,  infi  nitely  elaborated  community  of
minds that has been forged out of a trillion cognitive handshakes
over hundreds of thousands of years. Th   is community is the the-
ater of our daily existence. It separates life in the jungle from life
in the offi    ce, and because it is a community of minds, it cannot be
inspected by looking at the activity of the solitary brain.
## 12

Th  e perpetual conversations happening within the community of
minds, each resulting in a new cognitive handshake, are where the
conjective is formed and re- formed. And so it did to make the mod-
ern world.
If you merely ask people whether they have revalued the bour-
geoisie or not, they’ll probably deny it. Buying low and selling high?
Yuck. Bett  er aristocratic bloodshed on the batt  lefi  eld or bureaucratic
rule- writing in the halls of the Food and Drug Administration. Yet
you can hear what they won’t explicitly say if you hear how their
words changed over time. For major examples among many of the
changes in the conjective, consider how the words honest, true, in-
novation, and novelty exhibit the revaluation of the bourgeoisie in
English from 1600 to 1800.
## §
Th   e   word   honest shift ed from aristocratic to bourgeois honor. Th   e
sorts of deals people could countenance changed. Th   e   shift  in the
word  provides  powerful  evidence  of  a  change  in  social  ethics,  a
change in a decidedly bourgeois direction. To call a man “dishon-
est” in an aristocratic context required a duel with swords the next
morning. To call a man “dishonest” in a bourgeois context requires
a suit for libel, or more likely an exit from dealing with him.
Honest in its older uses did not chiefl  y mean “telling the truth” or

“paying one’s debts” or even “upright in dealing,” as it does today. It
meant “noble, aristocratic,” or sometimes “dignifi ed” in a society in
which only the aristocracy were truly dignifi  ed. What real aristocrat,
aft er all, would bother with merely propositional truth or merely
procedural uprightness when one had to look aft er style, gesture,
heroism, dignity, loyalty to persons, and social position? For Harry,
England, and Saint George.
Honest comes by way of Norman French from Latin honos, yield-
ing honestus, which in classical Latin never meant “telling the truth”
or “keeping one’s word.” Th   at   was   sincerus. Th   e   honestiores (against
the humiliores) of the Roman Republic matt  ered because they were
rich and noble and honorable, not because they were in the habit
of telling the truth. In 1430, an English lady— the word lady then
indicated  high  social  standing,  not  “any  adult  female,”  as  it  does
now in democratic usage— asked for a loan to pay for “honest bed-
ding, without which mine husband’s honesty and mine may not be
saved.”
## 1
Honest here meant “dignifi ed and suitable to rank,” and the
honesty was a matt  er of social standing.
A couple of centuries later, no change. Charles I declared from
the scaff old in 1649 that he was “an honest man and a good king,
and a good Christian.” He did not mean that he kept to his business
bargains or told the truth, which notoriously he did not. He meant
that he was noble, aristocratic, and worthy of honor “by virtue,” as
one says, of his birth and position, an anointed king. Th   e   modern
use of honest as “truth- telling and keeping one’s word” does appear
in English as early as 1500, but the meaning “honorable by virtue
of  high  social  standing”  dominates  its  usage  until  the  eighteenth
century.
Shakespeare, for example, uses “honest” in four distinct ways, yet
never in its modern, bourgeois, “truth- telling” sense.
## 2
Th   e   closest
Shakespeare gets is “genuine,” as in the ’umble servant Davy’s ap-
peal in act 5, scene 1 of Henry IV, Part 2 for an occasional indulgence
toward knaves: “If I cannot once or twice in a quarter [three months]
bear  out  [be  allowed  to  favor]  a  knave  against  an  honest  [high-
status] man, I have but a very litt le credit with your worship. Th   e
knave is mine honest [genuine] friend, sir; therefore, I beseech your

worship, let him be countenanced.” Th   e other three Shakespearean
defi nitions emphasize only knightly honor, as in Othello, Th   e   Moor
of Venice. “Honest Iago,” a phrase common in the play, is being de-
scribed as a high- ranking soldier by profession who was “honest” in
that he was “honorable, noble, warlike, aristocratic.” His motiveless
malignity toward Othello leads him to violate what we call truth. Yet
he is “honest,” a bit of dramatic irony playing on all the meanings
of the word.
Consider too the old phrase “an honest woman.” Othello’s Desde-
mona is so styled, repeatedly, an ironic commentary on her husband’s
suspicions of unfaithfulness, encouraged by honest Iago. It preserves
in jocular talk nowadays the original meaning of the word “honest,”
with adjustments for a woman’s place in a male- dominated culture
of honor. Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth I’s mother, refused Henry VIII’s
advances unless he married her, asserting that “I would rather lose
my life than my honesty,” yet in the end losing both.
In act 4, scene 3 of Shakespeare’s lesser- known play Cymbeline,
Pisanio,  the  loyal  servant,  says  to  himself  that  he  must  dissemble
to remain true to a wider truth: “Wherein I am false, I am honest
[honorable and genuine]; not true, to be true” [not truth- telling, yet
faithful]. Note the play on true, which these days means chiefl y “in
accord with the facts, propositionally accurate.” But it had originally
meant “loyal to a person,” a meaning that President Trump favors.
Th   e   Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles, which we are
using here and elsewhere, gives the fi rst and oldest meaning of true
as “steadfast to a commander or friend, . . . to one’s promises.” Th   e
meaning is labeled “somewhat archaic.” In older English, for exam-
ple, one might “pledge [one’s] troth,” cognate with truth and truce.
All  of  Shakespeare’s  plays  turn  on  genuineness  and  its  lack,  as  in
Hamlet’s agonizing or Portia’s appeal (in the guise of a male lawyer)
for mercy— a double deception since women’s parts at the time were
played by boys. In none of his plays is bourgeois “honesty” honored.
A century and a half later, the honest man in Adam Smith, by con-
trast, was not the aristocrat, noble by blood. Smith’s honest man was
the promise keeper and truth teller constrained by the man within:
“Th   ere is no commonly honest man who does not more dread the

inward disgrace.”
## 3
No one else will know your perfi  dy— but you will,
and you will disapprove, unless your impartial spectator within is
poorly developed (consider again Donald Trump). In Shakespeare
“commonly honest” would have been a silly contradiction. Com-
moners cannot be “honest.” Th   ey are good for comedy in prose, not
for noble speech in blank verse, fi ve beats to the poetic line: “I bet-
ter brook the loss of britt le life / than these proud titles thou hast
won of  me.”
By  the  eighteenth  century  the  word  had  changed,  signaling  a
wide social change. Honest appears four times in Henry Fielding’s
novel To m   J o n e s (1749). Every time, Fielding means “upright, sin-
cere” applied to commoners. Samuel Johnson’s 1755 Dictionary of the
English Language gives three senses of the word honest: “Upright,
true, sincere”; “Chaste”; and “Just, righteous, giving every man his
due.” Every man. None of his defi nitions is “aristocratic.” In Henry
Mackenzie’s 1771 Th   e Man of Feeling, it appears thirteen times— twice
meaning “genuine,” twice meaning “not cheating,” and nine times
meaning “upright.”
In  the  very  early  nineteenth  century,  Jane  Austen  used  honest
thirty- one times, a third of the time to mean “upright,” as in “an hon-
est man,” but never as in “a person of high rank.” A third of the time
she used it to mean “genuine,” as in “a real, honest, old- fashioned
boarding  school,”  and  a  third  of  the  time  to  mean  “truth-  telling”
and “sincere.” By the 1934 edition of the Webster’s New International
Dictionary, the word honesty  in  the  sense  of  bestowing  honor  was
labeled obsolete.
And it wasn’t only in English. What is extraordinary, suggesting
a deeper social tide, is that an identical change happened in other
European  languages  of  commerce  at  the  same  embourgeoisfying
time.
## 4
English got its word honest from French, we noted, compli-
ments of the Norman Conquest. In both French and Italian aft  er  the
seventeenth century, the descendants of the Latin word honos turned
bourgeois, just as they did in English.
What is still more extraordinary is that an identical evolution hap-
pened to an entirely diff  erent root in Germanic languages, meaning

“Honest” Shows the Change
## *
## 153
also “aristocratic.” In Dutch, for example, the word eer (pronounced
“air,”  like  the  fi  rst  syllable  of  the  word  in  German,  Ehre)  means
“honor.” In former times it meant, as in Shakespeare’s English, “aris-
tocratic,” but it came as eerlijk to mean commercial honesty.
## §
Innovation in the use of the word innovation tells the same story. Th   e
Oxford English Dictionary att  ributes the fi rst use of innovation in its
commercial sense, “introducing a new product into the market,” to
Joseph Schumpeter in 1939.
## 5
Th   e date, we reckon, is a litt  le too late (a
tendency in the OED arising from its method before texts were digi-
tized), but anyway in “innovation” Schumpeter included, as econo-
mists do, all sorts of bett erments— in making products, fi nancing
them,  trading  them,  inventing  them,  using  them,  and  so  forth.  A
good thing. By contrast, in earlier times the word was almost always
used censoriously. Th   e English translation in 1561 of John Calvin’s In-
stitutes of the Christian Religion declares, “It is the duty of private men
to obey, and not to make innovations of states aft  er their own will.”
Innovations violated the Great Chain of Being, in which everyone
had a master to whom he pledged his troth. Note the illiberal rule
that everyone has a master, broken in liberalism. Edward VI issued
in 1548 an act “To stay innovations or new rites.” In 1597 the Anglican
theologian Richard Hooker wrote about “suspicious innovations.”
Th   e High Church Archbishop Laud’s proceedings in 1641 were said
to be notorious “in bringing innovations into the Church.” As late
as 1796 Edmund Burke was annoyed about a “revolt of innovation,”
which results in “the very elements of society” [being] “confounded
and dissipated.” No Great Chain of Being, a conservative beloved.
But Samuel Johnson, just a few decades earlier, we have noted,
had writt  en that “the age is running mad aft  er innovation,” of which
he with a certain ironic distance approved. In 1817, Jeremy Bentham
would  praise  “a  proposition  so  daring,  so  innovational.”  By  1862
Henry Buckle, the optimistic English materialist, sneered at people
for whom “every bett  erment is a dangerous innovation”— but even

## 154
## *
chapter  22
then he was playing off  the conservative use of the word to att  ack
change. Only in the past century or so has the word graduated to
full- throated praise for bourgeois bett  erment.
## §
Novelty, too, long had a negative connotation. Wycliff e’s Bible circa
1385 discussed “cursed novelties of voices,” from the Latin profanes
vocum novitates in the Vulgate form he translated— in the original
Greek, more accurately, “profane babbling”— that is, heresies that
were already evident to Saint Paul. Novelty nearly always connotes
something verging on silly and trivial: think about its use now to de-
scribe what you can get from ice cream trucks and “novelty” stores.
It began to acquire favorable connotations, though, in the twentieth
century, when, for example, critics of painting and literature began
to complain of the absence of novelty.
## 6
## §
Ideas  changed,  and  the  words  show  the  change.  In  medieval  and
mercantilist times, patents had to declare that the new idea would
increase  employment.  But  in  1742  the  goldsmith  John  Tuite  said
boldly  that  his  innovation  in  Th   omas  Newcomen’s  engine  would
save labor— that is, put people out of work, which was forbidden in
an earlier politics (and now revised in the irrational fear of massive
technological  unemployment).  Two  years  later,  Jean  Desaguliers
(British,  but  of  French  origin)  was  the  fi  rst  person  to  emphasize
in print that steam engines did indeed save labor.
## 7
Previously the
British  government  would  have  obstructed  damned  innovations
and novelties, such as Elizabeth I forbidding the use of the knitt  ing
machine. At length, bett  erment tested by commerce, and bourgeois
speech  work  in  support  of  it,  came  to  be  regarded  as,  of  all  crazy
things, honest, true, innovative, novel, and saving of human labor.
And that, not “creating jobs” or “protecting” one group against
another, is what innovism born of liberalism gave to England, and
then the world.

Europeans  in  the  eighteenth  century  changed  how  they  thought
about happiness. On a long view, understand, it’s only recently that
people have been guiltlessly obsessed with either pleasure or hap-
piness. In secular traditions such as those of the Greeks or Chinese,
a pleasuring version of happiness is downplayed, at any rate in high
theory, in favor of political or philosophical wisdom. A Chinese sage
said of some goldfi  sh in a pond, “See how happy they are!” A smart-
aleck disciple asked, “Master, how do you know they are happy?”
To which the sage replied, “How do you know I don’t know?” Ah.
In Christianity for most of its history, the treasure, not pleasure, was
to be stored up in heaven, not down here where thieves break in.
Aft er all, as a pre- eighteenth- century theologian would put it— or
as a modern and mathematical economist would, too— an infi nite
aft erlife was infi nitely to be preferred to any fi nite pleasures att  ain-
able in earthly life.
Th   e  unhappiness  doctrine  made  it  seem  pointless  to  att  empt
to  abolish  poverty  or  slavery  or  wife  beating.  A  coin  given  to  the
beggar gave the giver a leg up to heaven, a mitzvah, a hasanaat. But
the ancient praise for charity in Christianity or Islam or Buddhism
or whatever implied no plan to adopt welfare programs or to grant
rights of personal liberty or to contemplate the national product.
A life of sitt ing by the West Gate with a bowl to beg was, aft  er  all,
an infi nitesimally small share of one’s life to come. Get used to it.
For now, and for the rest of your life down here, such is your place

chosen by God in the Great Chain of Being. Take up your cross. Quit
whining. What does it matt er how miserable you are in this life if
you’ll get that pie in the sky when you die?
Such  fatalism  in  many  faiths—  God  willing,  deo  volente, mert-
sishem, insh’Allah—  precluded  idle  talk  of  earthly  happiness.  Said
Job in his travail, “If I have put my trust in gold, or said to pure gold,
‘You are my security,’ . . . then these also would be sins to be judged,
for I would have been unfaithful to God on high” ( Job 31:24). “I am
the Lord thy God; thou shalt have no other gods before me.” Th   e
judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
Th   en  in  the  eighteenth  century  our  earthly  happiness  became
high  fashion.  By  1776,  “life,  liberty,  and  the  pursuit  of  happiness”
was  what  we  all  chiefl  y  wanted.  Jeff  erson’s  formula  was  by  then
wholly unoriginal. John Locke in 1677 wrote that “the business of
men [is] to be happy in this world by the enjoyment of the things
of nature subservient to life, health, ease, and pleasure,” though he
added piously, “and by the comfortable [that is, comforting] hopes
of  another  life  when  this  is  ended.”
## 1
By  1738,  Mirabeau  the  Elder
wrote  to  a  friend  recommending  “what  should  be  our  only  goal:
happiness.”
## 2
## Only.
To see how strange such a remark is, consider whether it could
have  been  utt  ered  by  a  leader  of  opinion  in  1538.  Martin  Luther?
Michelangelo?  Charles  V?  No.  Th   ey  sought  heavenly,  artistic,  or
political glory— not something so domestic as happiness. Yet in the
late seventeenth century, Anglican priests commenced preaching
that God wanted us to be happy as much as holy. Th   ey called it “eu-
daimonism,” from the Greek for “happiness,” which meant literally
“good- guiding- spirit- ism.”  Th  ink of Clarence the apprentice angel
in It’s a Wonderful Life. Anglicans and, astonishingly, some New En-
gland Congregationalists, turned against the old, harsh, Augustinian-
Calvinist line. We are not, declared the eudaimonists, mere sinners
in the hands of an angry God, worms unworthy of grace. No, we are
God’s adopted children and heirs (Romans 8:14–17).
Earthly happiness, heaven here, took on a new importance. Th   e
fourth  epistle  of  Alexander  Pope’s  long  poem  An  Essay  on  Man
(published in 1733– 1734) opens: “Oh happiness! Our being’s end
and aim! / Good, pleasure, ease, content! Whate’er thy name: / Th   at

And “Happiness” Itself Changed
## *
## 157
something still which prompts th’ eternal sigh, / For which we bear
to live, or dare to die.” Pope was no liberal, but he did emphasize an
invisible hand leading to temporal happiness: “Self- love thus push’d
to  social,  to  divine,  /  Gives  thee  to  make  thy  neighbor’s  blessing
thine.” He closes stirringly: “Th   at reason, passion, answer one great
aim;  /  Th   at  true  self-  love  and  social  are  the  same;  /  Th   at   virtue
only makes our bliss below, / And all our knowledge is ourselves
to know.”
## 3
It’s a poetic foreshadowing of Adam Smith, though un-
comfortably close to the amoralism of Bernard Mandeville, which
Smith detested.
Earlier generations had touched the transcendent by sett  ing  their
minds on the things above and anticipating bliss in the hereaft  er.
Th  e eighteenth- century novelty, then, is the talk about happiness
here below. As one of its more charming conservative enemies of
modernity, William Butler Yeats, put it, “Locke sank into a swoon; /
Th   e Garden died; / God took the spinning- jenny / Out of his side.”
## 4
Th  e eudaemonic turn, we affi  rm, was a very good thing, result-
ing in fresh projects to bett er our stay here on earth, some of the
projects remarkably successful. Democracy, for example, was one,
because if you followed the fashion for universal happiness, it be-
came impossible to go on and on insisting that what really matt  ered
was the pleasure of the duke or the lord bishop. Enlightened despots
of the era such as Catherine the Great claimed to seek the good of
all. Frederick, also the Great, claimed to be merely “the fi  rst servant
of the state.” Ha, ha. Such altruistic propaganda paradoxically gave
hoi polloi the idea that maybe they themselves could take care of it,
thanks, sans tyrant. Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in 1835 that “all the
English colonies [in North America] at the time of their birth. . . .
seemed destined to present the development of . . . the bourgeois
and democratic liberty of which the history of the world did not
yet  off  er  a  complete  model.”
## 5
“Bourgeois  and  democratic”—  that
is, liberalism.
## §
In  the  turbulent  seventeenth  century,  especially  in  England,  the
theory  of  happiness  started  its  transformation.  In  her  history  of

## 158
## *
chapter  23
Quakerism, Rosemary Moore notes that during the English Civil
War,  “Ideas  could  fl  ourish  unchecked,  and  the  parliamentary
armies provided a means for their discussion and dissemination.”

Radicals began to ask, as the “Digger” Gerrard Winstanley (1609–
1676) did, “Why may not we have our heaven here . . . and heaven
hereaft  er, too?”
## 7
Th   e intellectual historian David Woott  on, who has writt  en  much
on the Levellers, shows that in England between 1658 and 1832 the
high  theory  about  what  motivated  people  was  transformed.  His-
torically speaking, Woott  on explains, “Pleasure and profi  t were oft  en
coupled together.” But never, he claims, until 1658— bizarrely in the
publication of William Percey’s Th   e Compleat Swimmer— “were  they
claimed to be the only motivations, to the exclusion of all others,
such as honor, virtue, and piety. [It was] a new account of what it
is to be a human being.”
## 8
Th   e English political philosopher Th   omas
Hobbes at the time expressed it in extensively theorized form, and
in Woott on’s reckoning the new account of pleasure and profi t as
motivators climaxed a century and a half later in the theory of “util-
ity” proposed by the Jeremy Bentham (1748– 1832). Bentham’s was a
crude version of pleasure and profi  t, without honor. Woott  on  would
(as we would, too) label him “Bentham the Bad.” Bentham declared,
among numerous other strange remarks, that the only way he could
distinguish poetry from prose was by noting that poetry did not fi  ll
the line to the right margin, or, with more consequence, that the idea
of justice in legal theory was “nonsense on stilts.”
Bentham’s heirs among modern economists leap with gusto into
such  voluntary  madness.  Carden  and  Mc  Closkey  are  both  of  the
Econ tribe, yet we agree with Woott  on that the maximizing of utility
under constraints, as the so- called Samuelsonian economists put it,
does not yield a complete plan of life. “Th   e presumption that we are
all, as it were, in business as individuals,” Woott  on writes, supposes
“that the ties which bind us to family, friends, community, nation
are purely instrumental arrangements of convenience.”
## 9
## So Hobbes
had  argued.  Th  e late Nobel laureate of Chicago, Gary Becker, for
example, wrote in 1973 a pioneering paper on the economics of mar-
riage. He insisted on calling male and female humans M and F, who

meet in the forest and agree to exchange skill in cooking for skill
in  auto  repair.  In  the  few  places  in  the  paper  where  Becker  men-
tions love, he puts it in disparaging scare quotes, ‘love.’ It reminds
us of an old joke. A beautiful woman off  ers a lawyer to have sex with
him. He responds suspiciously, utilitarian- style, “Yeah, but what’s
in it for me?”
Ye t   Wo o tt  on  claims  that  such  utilitarian  reasoning  is  the  heart
of the liberalism we so adore here. Liberalism “cuts through tradi-
tional assumptions about status, rank, and honor. . . . Th   ose   who
were most prominent in att acking the old moral codes were also,
almost without exception, egalitarians,” he asserts.
## 10
True enough.
He correctly observes that Hobbes’s suggestion that “people . . . are
all fundamentally alike” may be said to mark the beginning of the En-
lightenment.
## 11
But the merger of such an “Enlightenment paradigm”
with liberalism inspires Woott  on’s criticism of what has been labeled
(in a historical claim we regard as a fairy tale) the rise of “possessive
individualism.” In a word, there arose an allegedly new selfi shness.
Woott  on,  that  is,  reduces  liberalism,  the  watch  spring  of  the
modern world, to a vulgar utilitarianism of Bentham’s sort. Woot-
ton stops the story of liberalism’s development with Bentham the
Bad,  the  bett  er  to  slam  the  modern  economists  he  detests,  the
bourgeoisie he detests even more, and the liberalism that he detests
most of all. Woott  on joins the left   and the right in the conventional
antibourgeois clamor among the clerisy, as in a lett  er  by  Gustave
Flaubert to George Sand in 1867: “Axiom: hatred of the bourgeois is
the beginning of virtue.”
Ah,  yes,  the  familiar  hatred  of  the  bourgeoisie.  Bentham  1.0  is
surely a bad thing as a life plan, though useful for designing highway
off - ramps and deciding which car to buy and other projects of cost
and benefi t. But stopping at Bentham and then rushing on to the
most  vulgar  of  the  economists  is  an  error.  A  liberalism  under  at-
tack even in 1848 from theorists like Karl Marx and Th   omas   Carlyle
bore its social and economic fruit a long time aft  erward.  Woott  on
att acks the notion that it could have anything good to do with the
modern  world,  though  it  was  bourgeois  Europe  that  created  and
benefi  ted from a liberalism that led to all our joy, of ordinary people

## 160

chapter  23
allowed for the fi  rst time to have a go— Woott  on’s grandfathers and
his mother, for example.
Woott  on’s axiom is that Bentham is really all there is to liberalism.
Yet he himself quotes Mill aft  er his conversion from Benthamism to
liberalism 2.0. If Woott  on had made Mill the stopping point for his
narrative instead of Bentham, it would have been much harder to
reduce liberalism to a desiccated 1.0 calculus of pleasure and pain.
Mill is the very essence of mature 2.0. As Mill wrote in a memorial
essay, Bentham “was a boy to the last,” a suitable ancestor to boyish
economists. “No one who . . . ever att  empted to give a rule to all hu-
man conduct, set out with a more limited conception either of the
agencies by which human conduct is, or of those by which it should
be, infl uenced.”
## 12
Which is Woott  on’s theme precisely.
In fact, liberalism 2.0 characterized the very fi rst generation of
liberals, such as the blessed Adam Smith, whose understanding of
humans  was  richer  than  the  much  younger  Bentham,  and  whose
liberalism Woott  on treats most unkindly; or the second generation,
Mill  in  England  and,  surprisingly,  Henry  David  Th   oreau  in  New
England. Yet the Benthamite version of liberalism remains the con-
ventional target of Catholic conservatives such as Patrick Deneen of
Notre Dame or left   Democrats such as Michael Sandel of Harvard.
Deneen, Sandel, and Woott  on make their att  ack on liberalism easy
by reducing liberalism to Bentham 1.0 and the portions of Machia-
velli, Hobbes, and Smith that seem to fi t selfi shness.
In  reality,  people  act  oft  en  enough  for  reasons  irreducible  to  a
business plan of utility. Th   e liberal ideology that Woott  on  att  acks—
both crude and sophisticated— can still inspire good politics. But
like its doppelganger the modern novel, it’s not our full and contra-
dictory selves. Yes, we have modern theories of selfi shness. No, we
do not follow them. Yes, Bentham was silly. No, liberalism is not.

Th  e Revaluation would have made great reality TV— Keeping Up
with  the  Bourgeoisie.  As  it  was,  the  drama  was  performed  at  fi  rst
especially in Holland, and only aft  er 1700 or so in England. Th   e   por-
trayal of fi nancial markets on the English stage, for example, spread
its technical language to the common tongue.

1712, merely) of Richard Steele and Joseph Addison was the voice of
the bourgeoisie introduced to polite society. It spawned numerous
imitators, for instance in Holland and Spain. Addison in particular
was, as Basil Willey noted, “the fi rst lay preacher to reach the ear of
the middle- classes.”
## 2
In his 1713 play Cato: A Tragedy, an inspiration
long aft erward to the American revolutionaries, the project was to
tame the “barbarous” (that is, aristocratic) pursuit of war and loot
by  preaching  sociable  virtues.  In  the  1720s,  John  Trenchard  and
Th  omas Gordon would use “Cato” as a pseudonym in their advo-
cacy of Locke- inspired freedom of speech and of religion. Th   e   cat
of liberalism was creeping out of the bag.
Th   e Revaluation in the decades around 1700 shows vividly in the
contrast between two plays, each in its era very popular, one from
the time of Shakespeare and the other, recording the Revaluation,
from the time of Addison, Steele, Trenchard, and Gordon. Th   omas
Dekker’s Th   e  Shoemaker’s  Holiday  (1599)  looks  on  its  face  “bour-
geois” but in fact celebrates the conventional, antibourgeois hierar-
chy. One hundred and thirty years later, George Lillo’s Th   e   London
Merchant (1731) gives the bourgeoisie its voice— and even honor.

chapter  24
Th  e Shoemaker’s Holiday tells of Simon Eyre, a mere shoemaker
(based on a historical fi gure of that name, a draper- mayor in 1445),
who ascends to the lordly rank of Lord Mayor of London. Ah, a story
of bourgeois enterprise, Horatio Alger– like? No, nothing of the sort,
not at all. (For that matt  er, neither are the Horatio Alger stories.)
From start to fi nish, Eyre declares that he is a “professor of the
gentle craft  ” of shoemaking. It’s a joke, because “gentle” meant “up-
per class,” and a shoemaker is not. He says repeatedly, “Prince am
I none, yet am nobly born,” a joke line taken from a contemporary
novel about this Eyre. His name, Eyre, is the English version of the
Dutch eer (Dekker was of Dutch extraction) and the German Ehre,
meant in this context as aristocratically “noble.” Eyre rises through
the ranks of alderman, sheriff , and fi nally Lord Mayor by accident,
not by enterprise, and certainly not by right of gentle birth. Dekker
has him speak always in prose, not the blank verse that was reserved
in the drama of the time for gentle characters. Again, ha, ha. Dekker’s
audience would laugh out loud at a prose- bound hero born with the
name “noble” who in fact made shoes for a living.
“Th   e  honor  of  the  Gentle  Craft  ”?  “Gentlemen  Shoemakers”?
“Courageous Cordwainers?” Dekker is sneering at the bourgeoisie,
not honoring it. Th   e play’s romantic lead, the aristocratic Rowland
Lacy, seeks the hand of the somewhat lower- born Rose, daughter
of Sir Roger Oatley, the previous Lord Mayor. Rowland disguises
himself as Hans, a Dutch shoemaker: “It is no shame for Rowland
Lacy, then, / To clothe his cunning with the Gentle Craft , / Th   at,
thus disguised, I may unknown possess, / Th   e only happy presence
of my Rose.”
## 3
Working among the shoemakers, though, he speaks in
prose. When it’s revealed at the comic close of the play that “Hans”
is actually the very noble and gentle nephew of an earl, it’s back to
aristocratic blank verse and to his real identity, and the marriage.
All  the  characters  speak  as  befi  tt  ed  the  Great  Chain  of  Being.
Th   rough military service, Eyre’s journeyman, Ralph Damport, “gen-
tles his condition” (as said Shakespeare’s Henry V to the commoners
at the siege of Harfl  eur) and speaks briefl  y in blank verse. But when
he returns from the wars a comical cripple— we are not in a liberal
age of respect for people with disabilities— it’s back to lower- class

prose. Eyre and his wife in speaking to journeyman shoemakers use
the familiar “thou” (compare French tu) but use the formal “you”
(vous) when speaking to their bett  ers. In every way Th   e   Shoemaker’s
Holiday enforces traditional hierarchy. No bourgeois liberalism of
equals dealing in markets here. Th   e stage direction “Giving money”
is second only to “Enter.” Well. Does it make the play bourgeois and
disruptive  through  money  in  the  sense  that  Adam  Smith  or  Karl
Marx or Joseph Schumpeter would understand, or now as a pha-
lanx of Silicon Valley “disrupters” and “infl  uencers” would? No. Th   e
payments are almost entirely from a superior to an inferior. Th   ey
are hierarchy- expressing tips, not the dealing between equals in a
market.  “Giving  money”  is  not  ordinary  business,  much  less  the
fi nancing of creative destruction. It speaks of a zero- sum world in
which one person’s loss is another’s gain, and therefore it is nobly
greathearted to give to one’s inferiors.
Eyre gets his loft y position not because of bourgeois enterprise
but because of sheer good luck, by happening upon a wrecked Dutch
ship and, at the goading of his wife, selling its cargo. As the literary
historian Laura Stevenson notes, “by att  ributing all the innovation
to Mistress Eyre, [the story] can celebrate Eyre’s later achievements
as a wise, just, and charitable rich man without having to portray
him at fi  rst as an entrepreneur who has sullied himself by conjuring
up a questionably honest business deal.”
## 4
Likewise the 110 Horatio
Alger stories from 1867 onward are commonly said to represent the
essence of innovism. Th  ey don’t. Th   e   att ractive boys are helped to
their good luck by att entive older men, every time. Innovism has
nothing to do with it. So too in Th  e Shoemaker’s Holiday. Like Th   e
Merchant of Venice, it dishonors trade, profi t, interest, enterprise.
## §
In  1731,  by  contrast,  George  Lillo’s  Th   e  London  Merchant  inaugu-
rated the “bourgeois tragedy”— a phrase like “gentle craft  ”  absurd
by  earlier  dramatic  standards.

Tragedies  were  about  gentlemen
and gentlewomen (the more gentle, the bett er), not tradespeople.

## 164

chapter  24
(names  indicating  character  were  conventional  stagecraft  ,   like
Charles Dickens’s Mr. Gradgrind running a school) declares proudly
to his apprentice, one Trueman, “Honest merchants, as such, may
sometimes contribute to the safety of their country, as they do at
all times to its happiness.” Note the new defi nitions of honest and
happiness  implied.  He  speaks  of  “the  dignity  of  our  profession,”
which would have evoked laughter in Shakespeare’s England, and
concludes with a defensive fl  ourish in the class language of the time:
“As the name of merchant never degrades the gentleman, so by no
means does it ever exclude him; only take heed not to purchase the
character of complaisant at the expense of your sincerity.” Sincerus
here, modern “honesty.”
Th  e play erases the distinction between the noble and the mid-
dling. All the characters speak in prose rather than in verse. Th   e   Lon-
don Merchant is embarrassingly amateurish when placed alongside
a work by Christopher Marlowe or William Shakespeare. But it was
extremely  successful.  In  the  fi  rst  three-  quarters  of  the  eighteenth
century, it was a frequently produced play in England, performed
annually for the benefi t of the young bourgeois of London, invari-
ably at Christmas, down to 1818 and oft  en also on the Lord Mayor’s
Day in November.
Th   orowgood  praises  his  apprentice  Trueman  as  thoroughly
bourgeois: “I have examined your accounts. Th   ey are not only just,
as I have always found them, but regularly kept and fairly entered.
I commend your diligence.” Th  e bad apprentice George Barnwell,
tempted  by  a  prostitute  to  evil  (though  a  feminist  reading  of  the
play can see her as a symbol of female autonomy), is disastrously
defi  cient, though he had once been promising in bourgeois virtues.
He  defrauds  and  then  kills  his  uncle  in  a  shocking  aff  ront  to  the
sensibilities of Lillo’s day. Of Barnwell, the goody- goody Trueman
says that “never was life more regular than his: understanding un-
common at his years; and open, generous manliness of temper; his
manners easy, unaff ected, and engaging.” He remarks sadly on his
wayward colleague that “few men recover reputation lost— a mer-
chant, never.”
A  supplement  to  a  later  edition  of  the  play  tells  of  a  physician

Th   e Change in Valuation Showed in English Plays, Poems, and Novels

## 165
treating  a  patient  suff  ering  from  a  guilty  conscience.  Th   e   patient
had mismanaged some of his father’s funds to pay for “an improper
acquaintance with a kept mistress of a captain of an Indiaman, then
abroad.”  Upon  seeing  Th   e  London  Merchant,  he  had  experienced
a crisis. But at the doctor’s suggestion he was reconciled with his
father, and the doctor told the actor who played the miscreant Barn-
well, “You have done some good in your profession, more, perhaps,
than many a clergyman who preached last Sunday.” A preface to an
early edition praises the preacherly tale of Barnwell’s descent: “No
lesson can be more necessary to inculcate among that valuable body
of youths who are trained to mercantile business, so essential in a
commercial country . . . than this warning how impossible it will
be to avoid the snares of ruin, if they suff er themselves to be drawn
into the paths of the harlot, . . . and plunge them headlong into vice,
infamy, and ruin.”
## §
Th   e  Revaluation  shows,  at  least  around  the  edges,  in  Miguel  de
Cervantes’s 1605 novel about pseudoaristocratic Don Quixote. Th   e
noble, if insane, Don just does things, impervious to reason or the
complaints  of  his  proto-  bourgeois  companion  Sancho  Panza.  As
the historian Joyce Appleby puts it, “Don Quixote . . . epitomizes
the qualities that spelled economic failure for the Spanish. Perhaps
his mistaking a windmill for a mighty opponent was Cervantes’ way
of saying that Spanish gentlemen, mired in the past, couldn’t even
cognize this benign source of energy for productive work.”
## 6
It  was
not until very late in the eighteenth century that you fi nd any such
praise for bourgeois life as Th   e London Merchant employed in Spain’s
gigantically popular and voluminous drama.
A century aft  er  Don Quixote and a century before Spain introduces
a few liberal characters into its drama, and a liberal constitution for
the nation, by contrast, the early island scenes of Daniel Defoe’s Rob-
inson Crusoe (1719) are fi lled with bourgeois calculation. Crusoe’s
problem of choice under scarcity on the island stands against stories
of shipwrecks in the Odyssey and the Aeneid and the Bible, in which

## 166
## *
chapter  24
God or gods stand ready to perform miracles of abundance. Crusoe
has to make painful choices as to what to take from the disintegrating
wreck of his ship. It’s the economist’s choice under scarcity. In the
novel the mundanities of scarcity became art. W. A. Speck writes that
it “can be read as a paean of praise to business activity.”
## 7
And so to dear Jane Austen (1775– 1817), in a thoroughly bour-
geois Britain. Marriage was the literal business of young women of
the gentry, a truth universally acknowledged. Th  e absurdly undig-
nifi ed and unbalanced prudence of many of the minor characters
in  such  a  business  is  contrasted  in  Austen  with  the  dignifi  ed  and
self- conscious ethical development by the major one— at any rate,
when they abandon their folly. Th   e minor Reverend Collins in Aus-
ten’s 1813 novel Pride and Prejudice proposes to the heroine Elizabeth
Bennet with idiotic prudence:
My reasons for marrying are, fi rst, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself ) to set the
example  of  matrimony  in  his  parish.  Secondly,  that  I  am  very
persuaded it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—
which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the
particular advice of the very noble lady whom I have the honor
of calling patroness.
## 8
Austen’s major characters never speak this way, not aft  er  they’ve
grown up. Like Adam Smith before her, Jane Austen is, above all, an
ethical writer, focusing on the coming to maturity of a free person.
Not much happens in the novels except ethical growth. Th   ough   she
was lower gentry, the daughter of an Anglican priest, and not her-
self a member of the urban bourgeoisie, she was amiable (a favorite
word) toward such folk. One brother became a banker in London.
She exhibited none of the antibourgeois snobbery that lasted into
recent times among the bett er sort in Britain, and is characteristic
of the modern clerisy.
Beyond her novels, Austen was bourgeois in the sensible concern
she had for money. In a lett  er to her niece Fanny Knight, an heiress,
Austen explained that Mansfi eld Park had sold out its fi rst edition,

noting that “I am very greedy and want to make the most of it; but
you are much above caring about money. I shall not plague you with
any particulars.”
## 9
In November 1812 she wrote to a friend that she had
sold Pride and Prejudice to a publisher for £110, noting that she would
have preferred £150 but “we could not both be pleased.”
## 10
Th   e   liter-
ary critic Marilyn Butler explains that Austen, who was thrilled to
have made as much as £400 in total from her novels (twenty times
the average annual income of a working family and only a bit below
what the Austen household lived on annually), and felt in her last six
years (1811– 1817) that she was an Author— because she was making
money at it.
## 11
Jane Austen, of all surprising examples, embodied the
## Bourgeois Revaluation.
Ideology oft  en leads the economy, we say. In India the best Bolly-
wood fi lms changed their heroes from the 1950s to the 1980s from
bureaucrats to businesspeople, and their villains from factory owners
to policemen, in parallel with a shift   in the ratio of praise for market-
tested bett erment in the editorial pages of the Times of India.
## 12
Th   e
people of India are now enriching by doing the same as the English
did two centuries before, improving in the most signifi  cant ways the
poor and the middle class.
For which we say, hip, hip, hooray!



No one expected the Bourgeois Revaluation and its liberalism, and
their  enriching  fruit.  Even  if  someone  had,  a  sane  person  in  1492
bett ing on where there would be a Great Enrichment would have
bet the farm on China or the Middle East, regions which then far
surpassed  Europe  in  trade,  science,  technology,  property  rights,
and political stability. Yet bett erment in the end fl ourished in the
dysfunctional northwest of Europe.
Th   e  Great  Enrichment  didn’t  occur  because  of  anything  his-
torically deep about Europeans, such as (to mention some of the
loonier,  if  ever  popular,  hypotheses)  melanin-  challenged  skin,  or
ancient  Germanic  liberties,  or  the  highly  selective  democracy  of
ancient Athens (populated chiefl  y by the unfree: slaves, women, and
metics), or a Christianity which for some reason waited nearly two
thousand years to pay off   in mundane equality.
Liberalism  and  its  innovism,  and  then  the  Great  Enrichment,
occurred instead because of a cluster of happy accidents between
1517  and  1789,  embodied  in  the  four  Rs  we  mentioned  in  chap-
ter 20— reading, reformation, revolt, and revolution. Th   ey led to the
fi   ft  h R , a revaluation of commerce and bett  erment, plain in literature
and political thought, we have shown, of England and Scotland, cul-
minating in the Bourgeois Deal. Th  e Deal was slowly expanded to
all  classes  and  was  partially  protected  from  the  other  B-  Deals  by
liberalism and the success of the innovism among commoners that
it inspired. You know our argument.

Consider reading. Th   e shared language of Latin unifi  ed the Euro-
pean elite in high culture, though Europe, as we have observed, was
politically fragmented. Once the printing press was reinvented in
Germany out of China, the unity- within- fragmentation made it hard
to suppress ideas from circulating. Aft er a fi erce “batt  le of ancients
and moderns,” European elites came to believe in the possibility and
desirability of progress.
## 1
Some other scholars claim that European
elites embraced the notion that progress was an obligation entailed
by God’s gift   of reason.
## 2
It was defi nitely not, however, a fruit of the
Renaissance, which was an elite accomplishment hostile to com-
merce and to equality of permission and favorable to conservation of
the high culture of the ancients; nor was it a fruit of the elite portions
of the Enlightenment.
What was crucial in the reading of books, though, was reading
by ordinary people, inspired by their library cards, so to speak— the
Benjamin Franklins inspired by, say, Daniel Defoe’s An Essay Upon
Projects (1697) to leap into extraordinary lives. Th  e presses slowly
enabled  reading  to  extend  far  beyond  a  Latin-  fl  uent  elite.  Books
came off   the presses in all the languages of Europe— this in contrast
to eff ective censorship farther east, in the Ott oman Empire and in
China and Japan.
Th   e political elites tried to make censorship work, which then as
now was the best way to stop destabilizing innovations, as nowadays
in  the  censorship  of  the  internet  in  China,  Iran,  and  the  Russian
Federation.  In  sixteenth-  century  Spain,  for  example,  the  crown
restricted travel and banned many books.

## In 1675, England’s King
Charles II issued A Proclamation for the Suppression of Coff  ee Houses,
the coff  eehouses being a fashionable craze (then as now) where men
gathered to hear the news and to study the price currents. Sweden
prohibited coff ee imports fi ve times between 1756 and 1817.

at length newspapers emerged, the elite turned to capturing them. In

But political competition checked the censors, besides creating
safe havens for political refugees such as John Locke, or for that mat-
ter  Th   omas  Hobbes.  In  merely  three  years  aft  er  1517,  the  printing

presses of Germany could spread fully 300,000 copies of Martin Lu-
ther’s radical works across Europe. In a week in August 1520, Luther
could publish 4,000 copies of To the Christian Nobility of the German
Nation, what he called a “broadside to [the emperor] Charles and
the  nobility  of  Germany  against  the  tyranny  and  baseness  of  the
Roman curia.” Th   e next week the press issued 4,000 more of a longer
version of his anti- Roman blast.
## 6
Th   e pope could no more suppress
the works of Luther than George Lucas could suppress bootleg cop-
ies of the 1978 Star Wars Holiday Special.
So it went, across the European edge of Eurasia, with rulers play-
ing a game of whack- a- mole they couldn’t win. Th   e allies of the de-
posed Stuarts of England, such as again Hobbes, could fi nd refuge
in France. Th   e allies of the deposed Bourbons of France could fi nd
refuge in England. Th   e Dutch printers soon overtook the Venetians
as  the  big  publishers  of  pornography  and  sermons  and  political
pamphlets, issuing in the 1690s radical Locke’s work in English and
radical Pierre Bayle’s in French. Voltaire’s Philosophical Lett  ers were
publicly burned in 1733, aft  er which many of the philosophes felt the
hand of state and church. But no matt  er: their works circulated, and
they undermined the ancien régime. Montesquieu’s Spirit of the Laws
was published anonymously in his old age in 1748 in Switzerland and
smuggled into France. Aft er 1832 King Louis Philippe enacted laws
against cartoons making fun of his pear- like visage and the corrup-
tions  of  his  régime.  Th   e  French  instead  purchased  their  cartoons
abroad, continuing to make merry of the so- called Bourgeois Mon-
arch, and at length toppled his throne.

Or consider among the Rs the Reformation. An explosion of such
reading material made it possible— that, and Luther’s eloquent pen
and his political luck. Th   e Bible was translated into ordinary Euro-
pean languages accessible to people who couldn’t read Latin, at fi  rst
a daring act, as when Luther did it in German. In 1401, a translation
had gott en the Englishman John Wycliff e denounced as a heretic,
posthumously,  and  in  1536,  it  got  another  Englishman,  William

Tyndale,  executed.  By  then,  however,  sixteen  thousand  copies  of
Tyndale’s translation of the New Testament, or one for every two
thousand  English  people,  were  circulating.  Tyndale’s  last  words
were, “Lord! Open the King of England’s eyes!”
## 7
Th   e Lord did: two
years later the newly Protestant Henry VIII ordered a translation
based  on  Tyndale’s  be  placed  in  every  parish  church.  By  1611,  the
English could read a version of the Bible, ordered and authorized by
King James I, or have it read to them in the lessons of the Anglian
mass. It justifi  ed Tyndale’s angry boast to an orthodox opponent, “If
God spare my life ere many years [to fi nish the translation], I will
cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the scripture
than thou dost.”
## 8
Th  e priesthood of all believers, and behind it the individualism
of the Abrahamic religions generally, matt  ered to the beginnings of
the shocking notion that a plowman has in right as much to say on
public aff  airs as a prince. Yet Luther, appalled by the Peasants’ Revolt
in southern Germany of 1624– 1625, was nothing like a radical in poli-
tics and wished the plowmen would stick to their plows, declaring,
“A worldly kingdom cannot stand unless there is in it an inequality
of persons, some being free, some imprisoned, some lords, some
subjects.”
## 9
Not liberal.
On the contrary, what made men and women bold in politics and
the economy was not Luther’s Magisterial Reformation (from magis-
ter, master) in Germany and Scandinavia, and also among Anglicans,
but the so- called Radical Reformation, ranging from some Calvin-
ists to all Anabaptists and Quakers, and then even Anglicans in the
form of Methodism, and fi nally a liberal Protestantism and even a
liberal Catholicism supporting ordinary people having a go. In the
fi rst wave of the Radical Reformation in the Netherlands, ordinary
people— combmakers,  bakers, cobblers, and others without inher-
ited eerlijheid, “honesty”— questioned whether the communion host
was  the  body  of  Christ,  and  suggested  in  heretical  jest  that  if  the
Virgin was holy, then the donkey on which she rode was a holy ass,
and compared that same Queen of Heaven to the local madwoman.
Th   e rhetoric of the priesthood of all believers congealed around
the notions of progress and dignity of ordinary people, not pie in

the sky. Th   e French liberal Turgot lectured on progress in 1750 from
a theological chair. Robert Nisbet called it “the fi rst . . . secular . . .
statement of the ‘modern’ idea of progress.”
## 10
It took a long time for
the “obvious and simple system of natural liberty” of Adam Smith
to become the default logic of even the elite. But it did take hold,
enough to be revolutionary.
Th   e inspiriting cause of economic change was not, contrary to what
Max Weber argued in 1905, anxiety over predestined election. What
made people bold in practicing frenetic bett  erment— not merely, as
Weber thought, defensive saving and hard work— was rather the par-
ticipation of ordinary people in religious congregations with weak or
no governance from above. Th   e Radical Reformation, as against the
more hierarchical one of Luther or Zwingli or Henry VIII, in other
words, was a delivery room for a democratic theory long aborning.
In particular, radical Protestant governance of congregations gave
standing  to  any  member—  thus  the  governance- by- resistance- to-
the-  king’s-  bishops  among  German  Pietists  and  English  Method-
ists; and governance- by- elders among Scott ish Presbyterians and
Moravian  Hutt  erites;  and  governance- by- local- community  among
Anabaptists (called now Mennonites), Independents (called now
Congregationalists), and Baptists (called now Baptists); and, aft  er
a  while,  governance- by- no- one- in- particular  among,  say,  Quakers.
John Wesley, for example, emphasized congregational consensus,
nonordained preachers, independence from state interference, and
sometimes even pacifi sm and tax resistance in the face of the state’s
proud projects.
Th   e Protestants discarded fi  ft  een hundred years of church history
to return to what they believed was the faith of the fi rst and second
century.  Political  argument  shift  ed  away  from  disputes  between
popes and emperors and toward disputes between governments and
individual consciences. In places like Switzerland, church offi  cials
came  to  be  accountable  to  their  congregants  rather  than  to  kings
and bishops. Th  e wars of religion, though they were nothing like
politically liberal in the modern sense, strengthened the conviction
that a man’s a man, for a’ that.
Ideas did it.

Adam  Smith  pushed  along  the  Revaluation,  and  he  was  its  most
noble and persuasive advocate. He is the hero of our book. Th   ough
he  wrote  two  and  a  half  centuries  ago,  he  is  fresher  than  today’s
newspaper.
In  particular,  the  Scott  ish  professor  of  moral  philosophy  and
father of modern economics never, ever said that “greed is good.”
Nor did he, unlike his friend David Hume (1711– 1776), lead towards
a Benthamite notion (before Jeremy Bentham) that “utility” from
benefi t minus cost runs the human drama. On the contrary, Smith
practiced “humanomics,” an economics with the humans and their
ethics left    in.
## 1
Aft er all, grass is utilitarian, seeking water and sun-
shine optimally. Rats (except in the movie Ratatouille) act for benefi  t
minus cost selfi shly in their ratt  y  litt le schemes. But humans, said
Smith,  also  seek  love  and  justice  and  courage  and  the  rest  of  the
peculiarly human virtues— and the humans fail, too, with peculiarly
human vices, such as envy and hatred and pride.
Most people have not gott en the memo about our hero and his
humanomics. Th   e 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind is based on a popular
biography by Sylvia Nasar about the prominent mathematician John
Nash— who surprisingly got in 1984 the Nobel memorial prize in
economics. Th  e young John (played brilliantly, as usual, by Russell
Crowe) is in a bar surrounded by some male Princeton University
classmates. A blonde walks in with four brown-haired friends. Th   e
young  men  discuss  who  should  win  her,  and  how.  One  of  Nash’s

classmates says, “Recall the lesson of Adam Smith: in competition,
individual  ambition”  .  .  .  and  everyone  except  Nash  joins  him  in
unison, with smiles all around: “serves the common good!” Nash,
who always thinks for himself, to the point of a sweetly Smith- like
Asperger’s syndrome, has a lightbulb moment, and declares, “No.
Th  e only way we all get laid” is by cooperating rather than compet-
ing. He dashes out, presumably to write it down in mathematics,
announcing dramatically as he leaves, “Adam Smith . . . is wrong.”
Well, no. About Adam Smith, Nash and his classmate were mis-
taken, and so are the many proud economists and calculators who
have  not  actually  read  a  page  of  his  books.  (Th   ere  are  only  two:
what are you waiting for?) Smith never said that “in competition,
individual ambition serves the common good.” Th  e ambitions of
Macbeth  or  Faust  or  Stalin,  for  example,  did  not  serve  any  good,
common or other.
True, Smith in a famous but routinely misunderstood passage in
1776 spoke of appealing to the self- love of others, rather than ap-
pealing to their lordly charity or their slavish obedience: “It is not
from the benevolence [or the compelled obedience] of the butcher,
the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner [and from your

from their regard [as free people] to their own interest.” He is say-
ing  that  you  should  be  properly  democratic  in  the  theater  of  the
marketplace— not expecting by lordly right to take without recom-
pense,  or  by  a  beggarly  lack  of  dignity  to  receive  without  recom-
pense. You and the baker and butcher are equals in Smith’s view. To
pay your way is to respect their equal dignity.
Like his contemporary the German philosopher Immanuel Kant,
Smith emphasizes in a liberal way that people are not merely means
to others’ ends, to be used up in one- sided coercing or begging. He
is affi  rming that they are humans with dignity and liberty, with the
right equal to yours to reply to a freely given off er, “No thank you.”
One must give, in a just and democratic humility, to receive with-
out lordship or slavery. Smith, an egalitarian respecter of persons,
would have been appalled by the young men in the Princeton bar
seeing the young woman as sexual meat, to be chewed from all sides

without regard to her interest, in a “competition.” Smith’s ethical and
economic point was that an equal right to say no leads to a massive
social cooperation, and one’s dinner.
Smith, that is, was above all an ethical thinker. He wrote the two
books, Th   e   Th   eory  of  Moral  Sentiments  (1759,  fi  nishing  the  much-
amended sixth edition just before he died, in 1790) and An Inquiry
into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776, with its own
sixth edition, slightly amended, appearing in 1791). Such a meager
output would make him a borderline case for tenure nowadays in
many universities, and a sure- fi re no in most departments of eco-
nomics. “Good Lord,” the economists would say aft  er a hurried look
at  his  academic  credentials,  “he  didn’t  publish  any  articles  in  the
American Economic Review reporting statistical tests or fi eld experi-
ments or mathematical proofs of existence!”
## 2
Th   e   Th   eory of Moral Sentiments is routinely ignored by economists
(though since the 1990s the academic philosophers, if not the econo-
mists, have started to pay the book serious att ention). Many prac-
titioners of our beloved economic science don’t know that Smith
wrote anything other than the Wealth of Nations, which anyway few
have read. We ourselves are not exceptions. Carden didn’t read Th   e
Th   eory of Moral Sentiments until the summer aft  er he fi  nished gradu-
ate school, and only then because he was recruited to the Liberty
Fund’s “Adam Smith Boot Camp.” Mc Closkey didn’t read it until
she taught it in a course on economic ethics in 1996 at Erasmus Uni-
versity of Rott  erdam, in the Netherlands— when she was fi  ft  y-  three
years old. Her graduate program, in one of Harvard’s numerous con-
tributions to the decivilizing of economists, had dropped the history
of economic thought as a requirement in 1963, the year before she
started her PhD. Shame on us, and on our teachers.
Ignoring Th   e   Th   eory of Moral Sentiments (or TMS, as sophisticates
call  it)  is  a  big  mistake,  supporting  the  crazy  picture  of  Smith  as
the theorist of “greed is good,” in line with the bright boys in the
Princeton  bar.  Many  have  supposed  that  there  is  a  mystery  that
Smith wrote in 1759 on “sentiments,” which they mistakenly take in
its modern meaning as love, and in 1776 on prudence, which they
mistakenly take in its modern meaning as the opposite of love, self-

ishness. Which is it, Mr. Smith, they ask, love or selfi shness? Long
ago, German scholars named the supposed inconsistency Das Adam
## Smith Problem.
## 3
On  the  contrary,  Smith’s  great  project  in  all  his  writing  was  to
develop a full and temperate ethic for a commercial society— not to
reduce all behavior to a selfi  shness suited to grass and rats. In TMS,
in a rare instance of intemperance in this most temperate of scholars,
he gets wound up against the chief greed- is- good theorist of the age
we have mentioned, Bernard Mandeville. In a doggerel poem in 1705,
Mandeville had embraced vice as good for business. His is the core
idea in the conservative theory of trickle down combined with the
socialist theory of trickle up. Spend, spend, spend. Break windows
to give jobs to glazers. “Such is the system of Dr. Mandeville,” wrote
Smith, “which once made so much noise in the world, and which,
though,  perhaps,  it  never  gave  occasion  to  more  vice  than  would
have been without it, at least taught that vice, which arose from other
causes, to appear with more eff  rontery, and to avow the corruption
of its motives with a profl  igate audaciousness which had never been
heard of before.”

Th   us his blast against “competition” viewed as the
Princeton boys’ scrum.
Smith’s   theorizing   protected   bourgeois   betterments—   like
opening  a  new  trade  in  pepper  or  devising  a  new  waterwheel—
from the att acks by other businesspeople “competing” by erecting
government- sponsored monopolies against the bett erments; or by
aristocrats intent on “competing” the same way to keep things as
they so pleasantly are; or by peasants or proletarians “competing” to
seize some of the stuff   by tip or gift   or theft   or graft   from the riches of
the merchant or aristocrat. By contrast, the bourgeois innovator gets
profi  t, and his dinner, by respecting the dignity of others. He works
not by coercing others in violent “competition,” but by making an
off er to a customer that she may accept or reject. Th  e seller with a
worse off er, naturally, regards himself as suff ering from “violence”
(thus regular taxi driver as against the bett  er  off  er from ride- sharing
company drivers) but he is not to be encouraged in the belief. As the
great liberal Mill put it in 1859, “Society admits no right, either legal
or moral, in the disappointed competitors, to immunity from this

## 180
## *
chapter  26
kind of suff ering; and feels called on to interfere, only when means
of success have been employed which it is contrary to the general
interest to permit— namely, fraud or treachery, and force.”
## 5
Th  e alternative to respecting individual dignity is deciding eco-
nomic matt  ers collectively, through the government, a government
seized by political “competition.” Aft er all, there are only two ways
to get other people to do what you would like them to do, such as
providing your dinner. You can coerce them, by private or public
violence; get the government to do it. Or you can persuade them, by
persuasion or off ers of money. As the modern- day liberal philoso-
pher David Boaz put it, “In a sense, there have always been but two
political philosophies: liberty and power.”
## 6
Th   e eighteenth- century French political philosopher Jean- Jacques
Rousseau opted for power, as Th   omas Hobbes had, and initiated an
antiliberal  tradition  that  eventuated  in  socialism  and  fascism.  He
met Smith, with whom he angrily quarreled, as he did with everyone
he met. (Rousseau sent his children to the orphanage to give himself
more quiet time to write a treatise telling people how to raise their
children.  Not  a  nice  fellow.)  He  imagined  that  the  right  of  a  free
and dignifi ed individual to say no should be trumped by a mysteri-
ous “general will,” which Rousseau and similarly placed experts or
Communist Party offi  cials could so easily discern, and impose on
others by coercive measures. (About raising children, for example.)
For the past century or so many good people of a sort that would
formerly have been of a liberal tendency have swallowed Rousseau’s
notion that the government is therefore a good protector of, say, the
poor. Let’s do it by power, the absence of a liberty to say no, not by
persuasion, having such a liberty. Th   e editorial board of the Wa s h i n g -
ton Post declared that “obviously, the market economy’s legitimacy
depends on equal opportunity, actual and perceived, which is why,
contrary to small- government bromides of the political right, gov-
ernment must intervene to protect less- advantaged participants in
the marketplace.”
## 7
You bet. Can a government with such powers be
trusted not to use them for the “protection” of the more- advantaged?
When have the rich and powerful, such as doctors protecting their
monopoly or farmers protecting their crop insurance or steelmak-

## 181
ers protecting their domestic market, not used governmental power
for their own benefi t? Th  e evidence seems prett  y plain, outside of
small islands of rectitude such as Denmark and New Zealand. And
even there, as Danes and New Zealanders can tell you, governmental
intervention to protect less- advantaged participants in the market-
place tends to be clumsy and counterproductive.
Th   e politics of power leads to endless proposals for coercive poli-
cies that are less than productive. For example: Let’s protect people
by government policies of antitrust. Th  e idea of a government as a
protector of the people against private monopoly, or as a protector
of the poor instead of lett  ing the poor work free of coercion, would
have struck an eighteenth- century Scot such as Smith as hilarious.
Europeans  of  Smith’s  day  saw  the  government  as  a  monopoly-
making  instrument  of  special  interests,  especially  the  interests  of
the lords in charge— and nothing like a disinterested body discern-
ing a benevolent general will, as though such a thing was plausible
on its face.
To say that Smith invented an ethic for a commercial age is not
the  same  thing  as  saying  he  admired  everything  the  bourgeoisie
did.  Smith  warned,  for  example,  that  the  interests  of  merchants
and manufacturers are “always in some respects diff  erent from, and
even opposite to, that of the public.”
## 8
He was warning against the
monopoly- making of a government seized by special interests. Po-
litically, he certainly did not recommend unfett  ered rule by the bour-
geoisie, what we now call crony capitalism. Th   e economist Th   omas
Sowell used to off er an A in his courses to students who could fi nd
any passage in Smith in which he said something nice about busi-
nesspeople. Th   at is, Smith was an enthusiast for free markets, but he
was no friend of businesspeople using government to “compete” by
erecting protective monopolies, such as taxes on foreign business-
people, paid in the end by domestic consumers.

Th   at is, Smith was not naive. Th   e philosopher James Ott  eson  iden-

society:  (1)  the  economizer  argument,  (2)  the  local-  knowledge
argument, and (3) the invisible- hand argument.
## 9
Regarding the economizer argument, Smith observes that “every
individual is continually exerting himself to fi nd the most advanta-
geous employment for whatever capital he can command.”
## 10
Th   at’s
not greed, merely ordinary prudence, such as you exercise when you
go shopping. “Capital” can be taken in a wide sense to mean any
useful input (such as labor or land, too) that has some alternate use.
Or the money in your purse.
How can you accomplish the most advantageous employment
among the alternatives, Plan A or Plan B? Well, you choose by your
own lights according to what the plans yield for you. Of course. But
note: it is by “your own lights,” not by the general will or by what
the government- protected monopoly of taxicabs wants. A liberal-
ism— no slaves, the right to say no— is built into Smith’s argument
at the outset. Yo u decide, not the government or the community,
not the experts or the masters. You know best how to “economize”
in using your own capital. It is a reasonable assumption, but one that
all the statists fi  rmly deny. And they deny that anyway an adult should
in equal dignity be assumed to choose wisely— even if on occasion
that adult does not. But the problem with statism is that only by an
imposed assumption of political and administrative perfection will
the general will choose bett  er than the individual does. And always
the statist general will takes away the dignity of individual choice.
Th   e general is a nasty master.
In a logic that economists fi nally got clear a century aft  er  Smith,
economizing means “choosing the bett er way of doing it overall—
Plan A rather than Plan B.” What is “bett  er,” said the economists of
the 1870s, is not “using the least labor” (Smith missed the point, and
it led to a sadly mistaken picture of the economy as a supply chain,
a picture believed always by the man in the street and by the stat-
ist enthusiasts for industrial policy). What is bett er is up to you to
decide, considering how much you value what you get from Plan B
compared with Plan A. Th   e insight of the 1870s was that “value” is in
this sense “subjective.” Value is not an objective, physical, engineer-
ing fact, a matt er of resources and supply chains. People with their

own,  personal  knowledge  of  their  own  preferences—  not  expert
central  planners  armed  with  engineering  knowledge  of  the  labor
content of goods— decide what is valuable and therefore what to
do. It is deeply liberal: no masters; instead, you.
Such  an  “economizer”  argument  leads  naturally  in  Ott  eson’s
scheme  to  Smith’s  second,  “local-  knowledge”  argument.  Smith
despised  what  he  called  in  TMS  “the  man  of  system”—  the  bossy
bureaucrat or the Communist Party offi    cial with the general will and
engineering knowledge in hand. As he says, “What is the species of
domestic industry which his capital can employ, and of which the
produce is likely to be of the greatest value, every individual, it is
evident can, in his local situation, judge much bett  er than any states-
man or lawgiver can do for him.” Th  e economist Friedrich Hayek
would in 1945 call it “knowledge of the particular circumstances of
time and place,” wholly unavailable to an outside planner.
## 11
Th   e   free
person possesses the relevant local knowledge, enjoys the benefi  ts of
wisely choosing Plan A, and bears the costs of not choosing Plan B.
Free adults would want the credit or blame in choosing. Th   ey   don’t
want to be treated like toddlers, who do not know what they want.
Th   ey are free adults, willing in simple justice to pay the freight.
Smith puts his hostility toward outside busybodies (recall Hil-
lel’s formulation of the Golden Rule) this way: “Th   e statesman, who
should att  empt to direct private people in what manner they ought
to employ their capitals . . . would be nowhere so dangerous as in
the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy
himself fi  t to exercise it.” Th   e expert economist who thinks he knows
how to fi ne- tune the economy or the politician who is sure she can
judge whether a high- speed rail should go from Boston to Worcester,
Massachusett  s, is, under Smith’s reasoning, a dangerous fool.
Th   e  economizer  argument  and  the  local-  knowledge  argument
then provide the basis for what Ott  eson calls Smith’s “invisible- hand
argument.” According to Smith, “Th   e annual revenue of every soci-
ety is always precisely equal to the exchangeable value. . . . As every
individual . . . endeavors as much as he can both to employ his capital
[and labor and land] . . . [so] that its produce may be of the great-
est value, every individual necessarily labors to render the annual

## 184
## *
chapter  26
revenue of the society as great as he can.”
## 12
Th   at is, people sell their
goods and services in as effi  cient a way as they can, which makes
the economy as a whole effi  cient in the exact sense of maximizing
the annual revenue of the society. “Th   e economy” is not something
separate from the sum of transactions of the individuals in it. Th   en
Smith articulates the apparent paradox, in one of only two places in
his published writings using the theological phrase “invisible hand”:
“He intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other
cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part
of his intention.”
Smith  is  not  advocating  gain  achieved  in  any  but  ethical  and
peaceful  means.  Not  “greed  is  good,”  or  the  Princeton  boys’  “in
competition, individual ambition serves the common good.” But
“by pursuing his own interest he frequently [note the careful quali-
fi cation of fr  equently] promotes that of the society more eff  ectually
than when he really intends to promote it.” Smith is using the local-
knowledge argument again. It was a feature of his own principled
intellectual modesty called by two students of the matt  er  “analytical
egalitarianism.”
## 13
He had writt  en fi ercely in TMS against the expert
“man of system . . . [who] seems to imagine that he can arrange [by
state compulsion guided by his conception of the general will, or
more likely by his own selfi sh interest] the diff erent members of a
great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the diff  erent
pieces upon a chess- board. He does not consider that . . . every single
piece has a principle of motion of its own.”
## 14
It’s liberalism again: you
have a right to a “principle of motion” of your own, as long as you do
not physically damage other people.
Smith was reacting here against a view of society and economy
dominant in 1776 and, alas, still vibrant— the view that government
can pick winners by an “industrial policy,” or that a black- lett  er  law
tells where taxes will ultimately fall, or that consumers need to be
corrected  in  their  consumption  (recently  revived  in  proposals  to
“nudge” people), or that natural liberty in running airlines or grocery
stores or education in medicine needs to be closely regulated— lest
we fall, as Bill Murray’s cheeky Peter Venkman put it in the original

## 185
Ghostbusters, into apocalyptic “human sacrifi  ce, dogs and cats living
together— mass hysteria!” It ain’t so.
## §
Against the idea that grasping greed is the ethic for a commercial
society, Smith wrote in the fi  rst line of Th   e   Th   eory of Moral Sentiments
that  “However  selfi  sh  man  may  be  supposed,  there  are  evidently
some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of
others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though they
derive nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.” He goes on
to rebuke, we have noted, Th   omas Hobbes and Bernard Mandeville,
by name and at length (both practices unusual in Smith’s writings),
for depending on no ethic other than a selfi sh version of prudence,
and reducing all motivation therefore to mere selfi shness.
Th   e   Th   eory  of  Moral  Sentiments  was  Smith’s  favorite  of  his  two
published books. He was what is known nowadays in departments
of  philosophy  as  a  “virtue  ethicist,”  in  the  tradition  of  Aristotle,
Plutarch, Cicero, and Aquinas, with lively parallels in other cultures
such as Hinduism and Confucianism. Smith was the last of the Eu-
ropean tradition until the 1950s and 1960s, when a set of British fe-
male philosophers, including Elizabeth Anscombe and the novelist-
philosopher Iris Murdoch, caused it to fl ower again. Mc Closkey in
2006 brought it over into economics, and in 2019, we have noted,
Bart Wilson and another Smith, the Nobel laureate Vernon, carried
on a Smithian economics under the rubric of humanomics.
Adam Smith, Vernon Smith, and the new tradition of humanom-
ics treat economic actors as mixes of prudence with the other virtues
which are more characteristically human than a prudence shared by
grass and rats. From the seven principal virtues of courage, justice,
temperance, prudence, faith, hope, and love, Smith chose four and a
half (courage, justice, temperance, prudence, and a litt  le bit of love,
which his teacher Frances Hutcheson called “benevolence”). He was
missing faith, hope, and the transcendent kind of love (Greek agape)
because he, like Hume and Voltaire and others, had an aversion to

## 186
## *
chapter  26
conventional religion. Th   ey did not see that hope (having a project)
and faith (having integrity) and transcendent love, the greatest of
these (which is value in its widest sense), are human motivations in
the offi    ce as much as in the church.
Of the seven virtues of classical and Christian theory, Smith paid
particular att ention to prudence in Wealth of Nations, temperance
(chiefl y, not solely) in TMS, and justice in a projected Treatise on
Jurisprudence, a manuscript of which was burned at Smith’s request
when he died (but which lives on in elaborate notes by his students).
Th   e approach Mc Closkey calls Prudence Only, however, reduces
all  virtues  to  vice,  and  in  particular  the  sin  of  pride,  which  is  the
worship of the self. In “maximizing utility,” as economists put it, you
set yourself up as your only ethical end, a litt le god in the style of
Trump. But a courageous man does not charge the enemy’s guns
for utility, or happiness, but for identity, for the very sake of being
courageous.  A  loving  wife  does  not  love  her  husband  because  he
is amusing or because he has yellow hair or because he can muscle
open the tops of jars (although that is a very good thing, Carden’s
wife thinks). She loves him for himself alone. She is interested in his
fortune beyond money. His happiness is necessary to hers, though
she derives nothing from it but the pleasure of seeing it. It is an end
worth pursuing for its own sake.
Smith’s  ethical  theory  is  deeply  social.  People  are  accountable
beings. As he put it in a lett er to Gilbert Elliot some months aft  er
the publication of TMS, “Man is considered as a moral, because he
is regarded as an accountable being. But an accountable being, as the
word expresses, is a being that must give an account of its actions to
some other, and that, consequently, must regulate them according
to the good liking of this other.” Th   ough the accountable being “is,
no doubt, principally accountable to God, in the order of time, he
must  necessarily  conceive  of  himself  as  accountable  to  his  fellow
creatures.”
## 15
We are accountable, one to another, and therefore to the
judgment of the impartial spectator formed out of our lives with our
fellow creatures. Unless we are Donald Trumps.
In  1600  or  1660,  no  one  in  England  or  Scotland  would  have
thought to write a two- volume Wealth of Nations, treating a nation

And Th   en Old Adam Smith Revealed / Th   e Virtues of the Bourgeois Deal

## 187
as a prudent project for the self- bett erment of a bourgeois society
and especially of its poorest members (though in 1662 Pieter de la
Court wrote Interest van Holland, a best seller defending free trade
and the republican government of the United Provinces; the Dutch
were fi  rst). By Smith’s time, though, the rhetorical ground in Europe
had shift  ed, and an ethic of acting had started taking the place of an
ethic of being.
## 16
Procedural correctness matt  ered.  Th   e new bourgeois
society Smith theorized was pragmatic, prudent, non- utopian, and
wary of both state power and monopolies.
Smith’s formulation of the Bourgeois Deal embodied an ethic of
self- ownership. He was especially indignant about restrictions on a
worker’s right to dispose of his labor as he saw fi  t. Th   e English Sett  le-
ment and Removal Acts, for example, would force the poor back
to the parishes of their birth lest they overwhelm relief resources.
Th   e acts literally removed and resett  led them, cleansing them from
a locale by order of the general will. Smith observed, “To remove a
man who has committ ed no misdemeanor from the parish where
he chooses to reside is an evident violation of natural liberty and
justice. . . . Th  ere is scarce a poor man in England of forty years of
age, I will venture to say, who has not in some part of his life felt
himself most cruelly oppressed by this ill- contrived law.”
## 17
## Compare
immigration law and especially its administration in the Trump- era
## United States.
Th  e invisible hand pushes people out of where they are wasting
resources and into where they are creating wealth, in both cases as
measured by people’s willingness to pay with the fruits of their la-
bors. But there is another invisible hand, a social one. We become
polite  members  of  our  society  by  interacting  on  the  social  stage.
Note: “inter- acting.” Smith talked oft en in theatrical terms, and he
did not believe that we could depend on natural niceness or natural
greed- is- good nastiness for social peace on the world’s stage. He em-
phasized that societies and selves shape people. As boys, he noted,
the  poet  and  the  philosopher  are  litt  le  diff  erent,  and  this  against
the Blue- Blood pretense that the litt  le lord got his nobility from his
blood. Rather, they are playing on a social stage their whole lives, in
never- ending improvisational comedy and conversation. As Smith

## 188
## *
chapter  26
put it, “everyone is practicing oratory on others through the whole of
life.”
## 18
Such commerce and conversation, whether social or fi  nancial,
change us. You have to live in the world to become civilized, and you
are a social— even a theatrical— product. As Shakespeare put it in
As You Like It, “All the world’s a stage, / And all the men and women
merely players.”
Above all, Smith articulated an ideology of the Bourgeois Deal.
He showed his ethical standard for the denizens of the middle sta-
tion in an unsigned memorial on a bourgeois friend, his very fi rst
publication, in 1758:
To the Memory of  Mr. William Crauford, Merchant of Glasgow
Who to that exact frugality, that downright probity and plainness
of manners so suitable to his profession, joined a love of learn-
ing, . . . an openness of hand and a generosity of heart, . . . and
a magnanimity that could support . . . the most torturing pains
of body with an unalterable cheerfulness of temper, and without
once interrupting, even to his last hour, the most manly and the
most vigorous activity in a vast variety of business . . . candid and
penetrating, circumspect and sincere.
## 19
It’s not a tribute to Greed is Good or Prudence Only or Me First or
even “in competition, individual ambition serves the common good.”
It praises the bourgeois virtues. Th   e phrase is not an oxymoron.
## §
Adam Smith’s Th  eory of Moral Sentiments, like many modern nov-
els, is about growing up, ethically speaking. In fact, liberalism is the
political and economic and social theory of adulthood. Th   e   adult
individual lives in a city with his family, and respects his community,
but exercises Kant’s “autonomy,” Greek for self- rule.
Th   e  other  two  of  the  three  great  theories  of  society  since  1776
are nationalism and socialism. If liberalism is the theory of being
an adult, nationalism and socialism are nostalgic longings for the

And Th   en Old Adam Smith Revealed / Th   e Virtues of the Bourgeois Deal

## 189
comforts of childhood. As Sigmund Freud noted, we long to return
to the security of our father and mother. Nationalism reproduces our
father, the king and country for which we are willing to die. Social-
ism reproduces our mother, who will protect and nourish us.
Modest versions of nationalism and socialism are not corrupt-
ing. It’s harmless, even sweet, to celebrate the victories of the US
women’s soccer team. It is virtuous to provide for your children from
your ability and according to their need. But many versions of the
father- mother government have been disastrously bad for human
welfare. Vladimir Putin’s nationalism in the Russian Federation or
Nicolás Maduro’s socialism in Venezuela have not been harmless,
sweet,  or  virtuous.  Yet  citizens  of  the  United  States  are  in  a  poor
position to cast the fi  rst stone. Governments worldwide are too big,
too bossy, too much the Hobbes- Rousseau “family” of masters over
children.
We should wish to be free adults, perhaps with prompt protection
by a modest government from invasion by Canada or COVID-19, or
maybe taxed for an eff ective safety net to help the poor and handi-
capped—but  mostly,  liberated  to  venture.  Which  is,  aft  er  all,  the

Our  intellectual  debts  are  too  numerous  to  list  fully.  Mc  Closkey
has been giving seminars and lectures on these topics around the
world for more than two decades, and Carden has given numerous
talks on the project at colleges and universities (many supported
by generous grants from the Charles Koch Foundation)— including
multiple visits to McKendree University just outside Saint Louis—
and  at  student  seminars  sponsored  by  the  American  Enterprise
Institute, the American Institute for Economic Research, the Fra-

Southern Methodist University as well as in sessions at the Southern
Economic Association (with commentary from Steven G. Horwitz
and Sarah Skwire) and the Public Choice Society (with commen-

Koch  Foundation,  and  Oak  Martin  did  a  few  explorations  in  the
history of hymnody that ultimately didn’t make it into the fi nished
product but that are appreciated nonetheless. Harry David prepared
the  index.  Howard  Finch,  dean  of  Samford  University’s  Brock
School of Business from 2011 to 2019, suggested that we make “Leave
Me Alone and I’ll Make You Rich” the title of the book rather than
the  subtitle  or  just  a  theme.  Carden’s  family—  wife  Shannon  and
children Jacob, Taylor Grace, and David— deserve special mention
for  steady  support  and  pleasant  diversion  as  the  project  evolved.
Th   ere is, no doubt, a great deal in this book which we get wrong or
treat inadequately. Please let us know so that we can write an even
bett  er future edition.

## Notes
We have kept notes to a minimum. When a fact or idea or even a
quotation is easily found by looking it up online (e.g. Federalist 51),
or when it is part of the common currency of economics or history,
known to all serious students, and uncontroversial (e.g., Edward I
took the throne of England in 1272; or modern economic growth
per person is on the order of a factor of 30), we have resisted the
academic temptation to add a note to exhibit our amazing erudi-
tion. But when a quotation would be hard to fi nd, we want to help
you follow up. When an idea or calculation is properly att  ributable
to Professor N— and there are many of these that we have boldly
appropriated: for example, Hans Rosling’s brilliance— we wish to
give  due  credit.  If  we  have  missed  any  of  these,  please  forgive  us,
then tell us, and we’ll fi  x it.

- Smith, WN, 1:421. Smith in fact applies it only to “capital” in a strict sense,
which leads him to a fallacious view that investment at home is bett  er  than
investment overseas. But his treatment of the allocation of labor elsewhere in
the book comes to similar conclusions, though his connection between labor
and product markets leads him into another fallacy, the labor theory of value.
Smith is our hero. But real human heroes are not without faults.
