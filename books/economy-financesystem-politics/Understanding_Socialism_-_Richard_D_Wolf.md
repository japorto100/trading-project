## Introduction
Socialism is a kind of yearning for a better life than what capitalism permits
for most people. Socialist yearnings are as old as capitalism itself, because
they are its products. Where and when capitalism's problems and failings
have accumulated criticism and critics, socialist voices have risen. And so it
is again now. Any serious discussion of socialism must begin by
acknowledging socialism's rich diversity. Whatever particular aspects of
socialism we choose to analyze, they need to be located within socialism's
complexity. That avoids presenting one's own interpretation as if it were the
entirety of socialism. In this book, I focus on the economic aspects of
socialism, how it differs from capitalism in broad outlines. I am more
interested in socialist critiques of capitalism and their implications about
socialist alternatives than in the particulars of the few, early experiments in
erecting socialist systems (USSR, People's Republic of China, and so on)
that history so
far offers. Finally, my own education and work constrain me to concentrate
on Western Europe and North America. Some important aspects of
socialism are thus not covered or discussed here. Yearnings for better lives,
such as socialism proposes, are not new. In slave societies, the slaves hoped
and dreamed of lives less hard and less out of their own control. Their
yearning aimed to obtain freedom. They sought social change that would
preclude any one person being the property of another. In feudal societies,
the serfs — "free" in the sense that no one "owned" them — yearned for
better lives too. Their subordination to lords included heavy labor and other
burdens that they wanted lifted. They hoped and dreamed of a society in
which they would not be bound to the land, the lord of that land, and the
feudal dues of labor and subservience. The serfs mobilized in the 1789
French Revolution to demand liberty, equality, and brotherhood. In effect,
the serfs had expanded on what the slaves had called freedom. In the
American Revolution against British King George III, the revolutionaries
were neither slaves nor serfs. They were mostly self-employed farmers,
craftspeople, and merchants subject to a foreign feudal kingdom. Their
yearnings thus differed from those of slaves and serfs. They wanted liberty
as individuals to pursue their dreams without hindrance from feudalism or

monarchism, whether foreign or domestic. They added democracy to the
goals advanced by the slaves and serfs before them.
The different systems of slavery, feudalism, and small-scale self-
employment produced masses of people yearning for better lives.
Eventually, each of those systems provoked revolutions. Many people then
sought to break away from and go beyond those systems. The French and
American revolutions marked key moments in the social transformations of
major pre-capitalist systems into capitalist ones. By "capitalist system" we
mean that particular organization of production in which the basic human
relation is employer/employee instead of master/slave, lord/serf, or
individual self-employment. The revolutionaries who wanted and built
capitalism hoped and believed that transitions to employer/employee
relations of production would bring with them the liberty, equality,
brotherhood, and democracy they yearned for. The revolutions' leaders
promised — to themselves and to the people they led — that those goals
would be achieved. But the transitions to capitalist employer/employee
relations that increasingly replaced the previous slave, feudal, and self-
employment relations of production had unintended consequences.
Capitalism soon proved to be different from what its revolutionaries had
hoped. While it enabled some people to be more free and more independent
than slaves, serfs, or self-employed subjects of monarchies had been, it also
seriously limited freedom, independence, and democracy for many.
Capitalism betrayed many of the promises made by its advocates. It
produced and reproduced great inequalities of income and wealth. Poverty
proved to be endemic, as capitalism seemed equally adept at producing and
reproducing both wealth and poverty. The capitalist rich used their wealth to
shape and control politics and culture. Democratic forms hid very
undemocratic content. The cyclical instability attending capitalism
constantly threatened and hurt large numbers, and so on. Growing numbers
of employees within capitalism began to yearn for better lives. They defined
those yearnings first in the familiar terms of the earlier French and
American revolutions: equality, fraternity, liberty, and democracy. They
criticized a capitalism that failed to deliver those to most people and
demanded social changes to achieve them. Many people still continue to
want a better, softer, friendlier capitalism, where government regulates and

intervenes to achieve more of what the French and American
revolutionaries had yearned for and promised. They often self-define as
"socialists." However, capitalism's development provoked another, different
perspective that also called itself socialism. In that view, capitalism had not
broken from slavery, feudalism, and monarchy nearly as much as its
advocates had imagined. Slavery had masters/slaves, feudalism had
lords/serfs, and monarchy had kings/subjects as key sources of their
inequalities, lack of freedom, oppressions, and conflicts. The
employer/employee relation of production in capitalism generated parallel
problems. Capitalism installed monarchies inside individual workplaces,
even as monarchies outside workplaces were rejected. Kings mostly
disappeared, but inside each workplace the owners or their designated
boards of directors assumed king-like powers.
Capitalism proclaimed democracy outside workplaces, where people
resided, but banned it from inside its workplaces. For some, socialism
protests against all the dichotomies: slave/master, serf/lord, subjecting, and
employee/employer. It seeks their abolition in favor of democratically self-
governing communities of equals. Such socialists insist that democracy
applies to the economy as well as to politics. They see no way for politics to
be genuinely democratic if it rests on a non-democratic economic basis. The
corruption common to all political systems resting on capitalist economies
— endlessly experienced, regularly exposed, and constantly reproduced —
is their proof. The inequalities attending all capitalist economies are
protected, and thus reproduced, because even a formally democratic politics
disproportionately empowers capitalism's employer class. How to
concretely organize socialism, and how to achieve transition to it from
capitalism, have always been issues of disagreement and debate among
socialists. Anyone referring to the socialist position on what constitutes a
socialist economy and society, or on how to achieve transition, is making a
major mistake. Socialism is more like a tradition of multiple different
streams of thought about these questions. The extraordinarily rapid spread
of socialism across the globe over the last century and a half brought it to
societies with very different histories, economic development, cultures, and
so on. Many different interpretations of socialism emerged. Likewise,
practical socialist movements over the same period display successes and
failures — in labor struggles, party politics, and in early efforts to construct

socialist economies and societies — that also shaped diverse kinds of
socialism.
The debates among socialists have sometimes been extreme. Some
interpretations view others as outside the tradition, not "real" or "true"
socialism. Some interpretations added adjectives to "socialism" to
distinguish among the interpretations. Examples include "democratic,"
## "market," "libertarian," "anarcho-," "eco-," "evolutionary," "revolutionary,"
"Soviet," "Christian," "Utopian," "scientific," "national," "parliamentary,"
"state," "Stalinist," and more. Socialists never universally accepted or
recognized any one authority's definition of socialism. Instead, socialism
has always been a tradition of multiple, different, contested streams of
thought and practice. We try here to explain when and why we use one or
some among socialism's interpretations and when we discuss the tradition
as a whole. In the name of socialism, individuals, groups, movements,
parties, and governments have sometimes acted in ways that other socialists
and non-socialists have found unjustified or even horrific. While the same
indictment applies to Christianity, or democracy, or freedom, etc., that is not
an excuse. Stalin and Pol Pot are stains on the history of socialism that it
must account for and reject. The Spanish Inquisition, missionaries'
misdeeds, holy wars against infidels, and countless wars among different
interpretations are parallel stains on Christianity. Centuries of colonialism,
the slave trade, world war, and mass poverty in the midst of great wealth
stain capitalism. Transition from capitalism to one or another kind of
socialism does not guarantee that all socialist goals will be achieved or that
none will be abused. The abolition of slavery did not mean freedom was
achieved and never subsequently abused.
Likewise, the end of serfdom by a revolutionary transition to capitalism did
not guarantee liberty, equality, and fraternity for all. Nonetheless, the
passing of slavery and of feudalism were important, necessary, positive
steps for humanity. Socialists argue the same for the transition from
capitalism to socialism. Indeed, socialists today, across nearly all their
different streams and interpretations, recognize that the tradition benefits as
much from acknowledging abusive usages of socialism (not to be repeated)
as from celebrating and building successful usages. Socialism is continually
reborn, since the problems of capitalism, especially inequality and cyclical

instability, remain unsolved. A particular burden for today's new generation
of socialists — and for the writing of this book — arises from the last half
century's taboo on socialism, especially in the United States. That taboo left
a legacy of ignorance about socialism in general and about its many
profound changes over the last 50 years. My hope is that this book helps to
overcome that taboo and its legacy, and thereby helps build a new
socialism.

## Chapter I
A Brief History: How Socialism Got to its Here and Now
Socialism grew from a small European social movement two centuries ago
into a huge global movement today. Historically, that is far faster than
comparable movements in history, such as Rome's empire, Christianity, or
Islam. Even the capitalism that spawned socialism as its critical "other"
began earlier and so grew less quickly. Today's socialism reflects its rapid
spread across a changing world's diverse natural, political, economic, and
cultural conditions. A brief look at socialism's remarkable history offers us a
useful angle for understanding it. Socialism exploded in 19th-century
Europe and took off across the continent. Echoes and ramifications of the
French and American revolutions provoked correspondingly revolutionary
thinking and writing. In philosophy, politics, economics (then called
"political economy"), and culture,
many ruptures and breakthroughs occurred. The remaining feudalism and
feudal empires disintegrated, and industrial capitalism and ethnic
nationalisms spread. The 1848 Revolutions led to major reorganizations of
Europe's map (especially the unifications of Germany and Italy), and
capitalist colonialism took major steps toward creating an integrated world
economy. All such events spurred the development and expansion of
socialism as well. Socialism gathered the critics and criticisms of
capitalism's evident tendencies to widen income and wealth differences.
Socialism came to stand for a yearning toward far greater equality.
Socialism likewise accumulated the protests and protesters against
capitalism's instability, its built-in cycles that confronted the working class
with sudden unemployment and income loss, on average every four to
seven years. The plague of recession and depression feared by most
employers and employees alike struck many as an utterly irrational feature
of capitalism and more than sufficient to provoke a yearning for a system
that would not need or permit such cycles. By the second half of the 19th
century, European socialists were numerous and self-confident enough to
form social movements, labor unions, and political parties. Socialist
newspapers, books, and pamphlets spread their ideas. Serious theoreticians

(especially Marx, Engels, and their students) added depth and reach to
socialism, developing the tradition into a substantive literature of social
criticism, analysis, and proposals for making social change. Marx's Capital,
Volume 1 defined a fundamental injustice — exploitation — located in
capitalism's core employer/employee relationship.
Exploitation, in Marx's terms, describes the situation in which employees
produce more value for employers than the value of wages paid to them.
Capitalist exploitation, Marx showed, shaped everything else in capitalist
societies. Yearning for a better society, socialists increasingly included
demands for the end of exploitation, replacing the employer/employee
relationship with an alternative production organization in which employees
functioned democratically as their own employer. In 1871, socialists seized
power in Paris and established and governed a commune there. For a few
weeks, Europe and the world glimpsed some outlines of how society would
function differently were socialism to replace capitalism. Socialists also
glimpsed a basic strategy for transition from capitalism to socialism.
Socialists would capture state power and use it to create, protect, and
develop the socialist alternative to capitalism. Socialists in 19th-century
Europe generally embraced the key slogans of the French and American
revolutions: liberty, equality, fraternity, and democracy. What distressed and
activated them was that actually existing capitalisms had failed to achieve
those ideals. Socialism was the demand to go further, to be more
"progressive," precisely to realize liberty, equality, fraternity, and
democracy. If capitalism could or would not move forward in that way, then
it needed to be pushed aside for a better system, namely socialism. Several
central issues took form as major alternative streams of socialist thought
coalesced around them. One issue concerned building socialism around
images, sketches, and
even functioning models of the desired post-capitalist society. Cooperative
workplaces, collectivist communities, anti-individualist kinship groups, and
more comprised social models that inspired "Utopian" socialists. Examples
include Robert Owen and his New Lanark community, Charles Fourier and
his Phalanstery, Etienne Cabet and his worker cooperatives, and many
others. The Utopians often believed that to achieve progress beyond the
capitalisms of their day, people living within those systems had to see and

experience today anticipations of future socialism. Constructing and
promoting such anticipations became a major strategy to win adherents for
a transition from capitalism to socialism. Other socialists tilted their
emphases elsewhere. Marx and Engels offered a "scientific" socialism as a
critique of Utopian socialism. They argued that beautiful Utopias would not
produce revolutions against capitalism nor transitions to socialism. Rather,
transformation would emerge when the tensions, conflicts, and crises
resulting from capitalism's internal contradictions produced the desire and
capacity for social change among a part of the population that could achieve
that change. For Marx and Engels, the potential revolutionary agent was the
industrial proletariat — the working class — allied with those intellectuals
who understood the future dangers inherent in capitalism's internal
contradictions. Socialists to this day debate the roles of Utopian impulses
and models on the one hand, and the mobilization of a revolutionary
working class inside capitalism on the other, in relation to strategies of
transitioning to and sustaining socialism.
Another major issue agitating and dividing socialists, particularly in the
latter half of the 19th century in Europe, was the debate over reform versus
revolution. Would the transition occur and best be furthered by accumulated
reforms of capitalism, or would a sharp break by means of revolution be
required? Eventually labeled as the debate between "evolutionary" and
"revolutionary" socialisms, its object was to determine the best strategy for
the socialist political parties then emerging. One side, often associated with
the German socialist Eduard Bernstein, prioritized "parliamentary
socialism." They believed that socialists should contest in elections and
engage electoral coalitions around reforms of capitalism, yet simultaneously
argue and push always for the further social transformation needed to
secure a new, better society. Such a strategy could build the mass
consciousness and the political-party apparatus to take state power. With
such a political base organized by a mass party, acquiring state power
would enable a transition from capitalism to socialism that capitalists and
their supporters could not block. Against such a strategy, "revolutionary"
socialists, such as Vladimir Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg, countered that
capitalists would never relinquish their wealth and power without resorting
to extreme measures, including mass violence. In the revolutionaries' view,
it was naive and foolish not to anticipate and prepare for those reactions to

socialist advances. Such socialists argued that it was always appropriate to
analyze the internal contradictions and tensions within capitalism to identify
moments when revolutionary ruptures were possible. Just as the English,
American, and French revolutions were key events in the European
transition
beyond feudalism to capitalism, such socialists anticipated parallel
revolutions for the transition from capitalism to socialism. Debaters of the
most effective path toward socialism sometimes also proclaimed middle
grounds: commitments to struggle for reforms but always with an explicit
caveat that reforms would never be secure until a basic change to socialism
had been accomplished, which required a revolutionary break. Just as
socialists have long debated the relative importance of Utopian versus
scientific socialisms, and reformist versus revolutionary socialisms, the
20th century brought forward a new and different kind of debate. The
Soviet revolution of 1917 inaugurated the first enduring government
committed to socialism: the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).
The 1917 revolutionaries (especially Lenin) drew many important lessons
from the very short-lived French socialist experiments in the Paris
Commune of 1871. Marx's analysis of why the Paris Commune survived so
briefly served Lenin with significant guides that helped the Soviet
revolution become the first durable experiment in constructing a socialist
government. From its beginning, the USSR provoked debate among
socialists. Disputes focused on whether Soviet leaders' decisions properly
applied pre-1917 socialist ideas and principles. On a deeper level, the
European socialist movement had to confront two significant changes from
what had agitated and driven socialism during the 19th century. First,
socialism now had two different contexts that became two distinct, albeit
also connected, social projects. Socialists living and working inside still-
capitalist countries continued to
focus on how to mobilize workers for transformation to socialism.
Socialists living and working in the USSR, meanwhile, focused on
constructing, protecting, and strengthening a socialist economy, society, and
government. Many of the latter socialists appealed to their comrades inside
capitalist countries to give priority to defending and supporting socialism's
"first country," the USSR. On that question socialists split everywhere.

Socialists supporting the Soviet interpretation mostly changed their name to
"communists" and broke away to form communist parties. Socialists who
were more or less skeptical or critical of Soviet actions and statements
generally held on to the name "socialist." Debates swirled openly among
multiple socialist and communist parties, and also (usually less openly)
within them, over whether and how the USSR embodied, distorted, or
betrayed socialism. Those debates continued even after the USSR imploded
in 1989. The new USSR's charismatic leader, Lenin, took the position that
what the 1917 revolution had accomplished was what he called "state
capitalism." By that he meant that socialists had achieved and sustained
state power and used it to displace private capitalists from their enterprise
positions. The new USSR nationalized industry and placed state
functionaries in the place formerly occupied by private capitalist boards of
directors. The employer/employee structure of capitalism had been retained,
but who the employers were had been changed. Debates among socialists
had to broaden to consider state capitalism alongside private capitalism and
socialism as forms relevant to socialist strategy. However, that broadening
lasted only a short time. Lenin's death in 1924, the bitter split within
the Soviet leadership between Leon Trotsky and Josef Stalin, and Stalin's
emergence as the dominant leader starkly changed socialist debates.
Perhaps Stalin's most consequential early decision was to declare that the
USSR had achieved socialism. What Lenin had called "state capitalism"
thus became "socialism." Stalin offered the USSR as the successfully
achieved transition from capitalism to socialism, the model for those
seeking socialism everywhere. Whatever Stalin's intent — perhaps to give
the long-suffering Soviet people a sense that all their sacrifices had
achieved their goal — his declaration had deeply problematic effects. It
identified socialism — for the world — with a social system at once poor,
wracked with internal conflicts, and tightly controlled by a harsh political
dictatorship. Socialism's enemies have used this identification ever since to
equate political dictatorship with socialism. Of course, this required
obscuring or denying that (1) dictatorships have often existed in capitalist
societies and (2) socialisms have often existed without dictatorships. That
obscuring and denying continues to this day. The second big change that the
first half of the 20th century brought into socialism came from the rise of
local movements against capitalist imperialism. Their targets were Europe's

formal colonialism, chiefly in Asia and Africa, and the US's less formal, but
no less real, colonialism in Latin America. Those oppositional movements
increasingly found their way to socialism. Sometimes, students attending
universities in colonizing countries encountered socialists and socialism
there. More generally, colonized people seeking independence took
inspiration from, and saw alliance
possibilities with, workers fighting exploitation in the colonizing countries.
The latter increasingly glimpsed similar possibilities from the other side.
Socialism spread, via capitalist imperialism, to all colonies and thereby
helped to create a global socialist tradition. The multiple interpretations of
socialism that had evolved in capitalism's centers thus spawned yet more
and further-differentiated interpretations of socialism. In particular, diverse
streams within the anti-colonial and anti-imperialist tradition — theoretical
and practical — interacted with and enriched socialism. Over the second
half of the 20th century, until 1989, global socialism exhibited both its
greatest successes and worst setbacks. By the 1970s, the USSR had
recovered from World War II to become the world's second superpower.
Communist parties held power in Eastern Europe, China, Cuba, Vietnam,
and beyond. Anti-colonial movements were often infused with socialist
ideas and led by socialists. The Vietnam War pitted one product of the anti-
colonial-cum-socialist movement against its opposite. The final defeat of
the US in Vietnam in 1975 marked a kind of peak for modern socialism.
Socialist parties frequently formed governments, alone or in coalitions
(sometimes with communist parties), across Europe after 1945. The
socialism/communism split that developed after 1917 was hardened in and
by the Cold War. Socialism — often called "democratic socialism," "social
democracy," or "socialist democracy" — took hold in Northern and Western
Europe especially. Workplaces there were mostly left in the hands of private
capitalists. However, the government
sometimes operated some major industries (e.g., utilities, transport, banks)
while controlling the economy with heavy regulations and taxation. The
government's goals included labor protections, income redistribution, and
provision of basic welfare via subsidized education, housing, transport, and
health care. This kind of socialism stressed its difference from — and often
political opposition to — the communist system in the Eastern European

countries allied to the USSR. Those countries also referred to their
economic systems as "socialist." In them, the government owned and
operated large sections of industry and agriculture, and provided more
subsidized public services. Social democrats and communists criticized and
debated one another. At the same time, the celebrants of private capitalism
mostly attacked both kinds of socialism. Dissenters criticized both of the
major streams, or types, of socialism. For example, some believed that the
communist stream empowered the state apparatus excessively, in violation
of the bottom-up notion of social power they identified with socialism.
Others found social democracy left too much power and wealth
concentrated in the hands of large private capitalist interests. Social-
democratic regulations and public services were always insecure, always
vulnerable to well-financed attacks when private capitalists opposed them.
The social democracies' capitalist-generated inequalities rendered their
democracies not genuinely socialist in such dissenters' view. In the United
States a peculiarly skewed notion of socialism took hold, especially among
those who disliked it, but also among the general public. Large segments of
the population
came to view the terms "communist," "socialist" "anarchist," "Marxist" and
for many also "liberal," as synonyms. They were all "anti-American," and
there was really little point or need to distinguish among them. This unusual
perspective was partly the fruit of an admittedly poor education system
unbalanced by Cold War ideological imperatives. Waves of McCarthyite
opposition to communism — as well as left-wing, center-left, and even
liberal politics — have swept through the US since the mid-1940sf faded in
some parts of the country while remaining strong in others. Such opposition
has even resurfaced again now in the Trump era. Those waves effectively
destroyed the US communist and socialist parties to an extent rarely
equaled elsewhere after World War II. The repressions also taught large
portions of the US public to suspect, dismiss, demonize, and avoid all the
synonyms equally. The taboo on socialism imposed by anti-communism in
the US after World War II had kept socialism from being taught in most
schools. And when it was, teachers treated it dismissively and briefly. They
needed to prove their anti-socialist credentials amid a general demonization
across social institutions of all things socialist. The 1950s firing of teachers
with known socialist sympathies had been an effective warning. US labor

unions, too, were caught up in the anti-socialism sentiment and turned
against what were often their most militant members and organizers. Thus,
unlike its counterparts in most other capitalist countries, organized labor in
the US largely severed its previously close connections with socialist
organizations and individuals. The 50-year decline of the US labor
movement was partly a result of anti-socialist purges inside US unions as
they tried to show
a loyalty to capitalism that they hoped would protect them. It did not. For
many, communism, socialism, Marxism, anarchism, and more recently
terrorism, are all noxious anti-American ideologies and practices that differ
only in their spelling. From the mid-1940s until Bernie Sanders' 2016
campaign for president, any candidate accepting the label "socialist"
thereby risked political suicide. It was not unusual in the US to see almost
all government activity (other than the military) attacked as socialist (e.g.,
the post office, Amtrak, TVA, Medicare, Medicaid, and so on). Thus,
countless Soviet scholars could and did explain that the USSR was socialist
— or even state capitalist — and merely hoped one day to develop further
into communism. Nonetheless, few in the US paid attention. For most,
either word applied synonymously. Such was not the case in Europe, where
most people knew from family, neighbors, newspapers, and so on, what
rough boundaries separated socialists from communists, etc. The implosion
of the USSR and its Eastern European allies in 1989-1990 set back
socialism generally, but especially the communist stream. The social-
democracy stream was less affected. However, many of socialism's critics
have since portrayed the end of the USSR as some sort of final victory for
capitalism in its 20th-century struggle with socialism/communism. Amid
the capitalist triumphalism, all strains of socialism were thrown together as
having somehow all expired. The reality would soon prove quite different.
Capitalist triumphalism attached itself to the neoliberalism that surged in
the 1980-2008 period. Neoliberalism is an
ideology holding that deregulated market-exchange and private- (not state-)
owned and -operated enterprises always yield superior economic results,
including in housing, health care, education, etc. Sustained economic
growth (its dependence on debt expansion ignored or downplayed) enabled
the idea that a "new economy" had emerged that would grow forever and

would finally bury an abandoned socialism. Many socialists and
communists were depressed and deactivated by the triumphalism and
perceived economic growth, especially in the old centers of capitalism
(Western Europe, North America, and Japan). Yet just below the radar of
most Western public opinion, China's brand of socialism — a hybrid state
capitalism that included both communist and social-democratic streams —
proved it could grow faster over more years than any capitalist economy
had ever done. By early in the 21st century, China had become the second
economic superpower, after the US, and was gaining fast. Socialism, it
turned out, had not died, but it had moved its center east. That should not
have surprised anyone, since capitalism had done the same. The 2008
global crash of capitalism, and the neoliberalism that had preceded it since
the 1970s, added new disruptions to the history of socialism. Neoliberalism
generated a surge of income and consumption growth that challenged the
Soviet and Eastern European socialisms. Those systems had focused on
industrial growth (impressively achieved) that prioritized capital goods and
infrastructure over individual consumption. The latter was promised but
largely postponed to facilitate the growth of the former. But their
populations, badly affected by World War II, resisted and resented
repetitions of reduced,
postponed, or slow consumption growth. Reduced Cold War tensions, plus
the spread of television and other displays of disparate consumption levels,
plus building resentments over limited civil liberties, combined to collapse
the Soviet and Eastern European socialist governments. A relatively
peaceful transition away from them began. Ironically, because little internal
debate had been allowed by those governments, the broad citizenry knew
little about the diverse streams of socialism. The existing socialist
governments had presented their shared interpretation of socialism as the
only valid, real version. Thus the only alternative to the socialism that most
Eastern Europeans knew was its arch-other, namely Western capitalism. The
idea that there were other kinds of socialism than what existed in Eastern
Europe — and that their citizens' aspirations might best be achieved via
transition to one of them—was rarely put forward. In the rush to exit from
Eastern European socialism, the crowds surged toward Western capitalism
with but a few, unheeded voices urging that the desired goal be Scandinavia
or Germany, not the UK or US. It was another history lesson showing the

deep dangers everywhere of shutting down debate over alternative systems.
The economic surge of Western capitalism, despite being debt-driven,
created a near euphoric notion of capitalism's ascendancy. That was
reinforced into full euphoria with the collapse of the world's first socialist
state, the USSR, and its post-World War II European allies. The 20th
century's struggle between capitalism and socialism seemed over, won
definitively by capitalism. The future would be perpetual capitalist growth
benefiting all. Warning signs — including the
hard historical fact that capitalism has suffered costly, periodic boom-and-
bust cycles across its history — were widely ignored. Both government and
corporate debts accumulated, and new populations were introduced to the
joys of consumer debts. Many thought it need never end. But it did in 2007
and 2008 when debt bubbles burst and took down the global capitalism
system. Once-proud megabanks and other megacorporations suddenly
stopped bashing governments as wasteful, inefficient burdens on the private
sector's back. Instead their private jets took them to global capitals where
they begged to be bailed out by trillions of dollars or euros of government
money. Given the corporations' political power, the governments responded.
They financed huge bailouts with massive additional government debts.
Once done, governments decided to rein in the exploding debts by imposing
austerity — at least slowing, if not reducing, government spending and
borrowing. Public employment, pensions, and public services became major
targets for cuts. Given the neoliberal mentality cultivated over the prior
decades, most "leaders" foresaw few risks in their austerity policies. Few
imagined that many people would balk at the sequential spectacle of (1)
megacapitalists profiting from a debt bubble they helped to create, (2) those
same capitalists securing a government bailout when that bubble burst, and
(3) leaders then imposing austerity on average citizens to offset the bailout.
Nor did the leaders see the dangers in demanding that the working classes
they had victimized also absorb the social costs of massive new waves of
desperate immigrants.
They were wrong. A revolt commenced, slowly at first, differing with
national and regional contexts. Capitalism's instability, inequality, and
injustice were just too much. Increasingly, voters turned against the
traditional old political leaders and parties, the center-left and center-right

that had comfortably alternated in power. Both had dutifully administered
the neoliberal regimes in North America, Western Europe, and Japan since
the 1970s. Both had cooperated in bailing out the collapsed
megacorporations from 2008 to 2010. And both had then promised the
people to ease austerity but, once in power, mostly did the opposite.
"Populisms" of the left and right surged into political prominence. Some
formed new political parties. Some entered strained coalitions with the old
center-lefts and center-rights. Some forced alliances in which they
subsumed elements of the older, traditional parties under a new "populist"
leadership. Sometimes they governed. And sometimes they refused to play
parliamentary politics and remained "populist" movements. On the left,
such populisms often included explicit anti-capitalist aspects. On the right,
flirtations, or more, with fascism often occurred. Socialism suffered a
peculiar combination of decline and rebirth in the aftermath of the 2008
capitalist collapse. It continued the decline that had set in after the 1970s
and had accelerated with the demise of the USSR and Eastern European
socialist governments. Social-democratic parties began a steady loss of
voters and social support, partly because of their accommodations to
neoliberalism, especially when that included acceptance of austerity
policies. Some socialist parties dissolved. Some entered coalitions with
their
former adversaries, the traditional center-right parties. All these maneuvers
failed to stem the decline of traditional socialism. But rebirths also
occurred. In some European countries, explicitly anti-capitalist parties
formed that were socialist in substance but ambivalent about the name. The
word "socialism" had acquired a host of bad associations in a century of
demonization by its enemies, who often equated socialism with the worst
programs undertaken in its name (by Stalin, Pol Pot, etc). After its global
crash in 2008-2010, capitalism's veneer was badly broken and a renewed
socialism burst forth. In the US, the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011
included explicit and self-confident affirmations of both anti-capitalism and
pro-socialism convictions in ways not seen in the prior half century of mass
social movements. Then Bernie Sanders' breakthrough 2016 campaign, in
which he ran for president as an explicit "democratic socialist," returned
socialism to a place within major portions of public discourse about US
politics and society. In each country on earth, socialism exists, advances,

and retreats. It processes the lessons and bears the scars of its history there.
Yet each country and its socialism are also shaped by socialism's global
history: by now a richly accumulated tradition of many diverse streams
(interpretations, tendencies, etc.). They reflect its two centuries of gains and
losses, successes and failures, declines and rebirths, and critical responses
to capitalism's shifting fortunes and contradictions. Socialism's repeated
revivals, like its global spread, attest to its deep relevance to a troubled
capitalist wortd, past and present. We need to understand
socialism because it has shaped, and will continue to shape, us all. It is the
greatest assemblage we possess of the thoughts, experiences, and
experiments accomplished by those yearning to do better than capitalism.
Chapter II
## What Is Socialism?
Socialism is a yearning by people living in a capitalist economic system,
whether private or state capitalist, to do better than what that capitalism
permits and enables. By "doing better," socialists mean many things. One is
having work that is more socially meaningful, less physically and
environmentally destructive, and more secure in delivering an adequate
income for yourself and your family than what is generally available in
capitalist societies. Another is having the lifelong education, leisure, and
civil freedoms to pursue real participation in politics, intimate and
friendship relationships, and cultural activities of your choice. Socialists
want to be able to explore and develop their full potentials as individuals
and members of society while contributing to its welfare and growth.
Of course, these are abstractions and generalizations, but they suffice at this
early stage of our argument. Socialists believe such desires are generally
frustrated for most people in capitalist societies. Transition from a capitalist
to a socialist society is then the means to achieve a society that successfully
provides all people with better lives in the sense conveyed above. In
societies with a slave economic system, many slaves yearned for
emancipation from the horrific burdens and constraints imposed on them.
Their thoughts, dreams, and actions eventually contributed to achieving this

goal. Likewise, serfs wanted to abolish the burdens imposed on them by the
feudal economic system, and over time they helped make the break from
that system. Socialists recognize the uniqueness of slavery and feudalism
and also draw inspiration from the slaves' and serfs' struggles against these
past economic systems. Socialists want to make a parallel break from
capitalism. Slaves and serfs learned that freedom, liberty, and the
overcoming of slavery and feudalism did not magically solve all their
problems. Socialists have come to learn the same about socialism. Ending
slavery and feudalism were enormously important, progressive steps taken
in human history. Socialism, too, will not be a panacea, but it will, in
socialists' views, represent a major progressive improvement over
capitalism. Beyond their shared yearning, socialists advocate a variety of
criticisms of capitalism, a variety of strategies for transition to socialism,
and a variety of conceptions of what socialism is.
Because in most cases socialists focus on the economy, so shall we here.
Any economy is a set of ways and means to produce and distribute goods
and services that the people in that community need or want. Our food,
clothing, shelter, amusements, transport, and much more comprise our
needs and wants. Our labor combines with tools and equipment and
workplaces, as so many inputs, to produce goods and services, as so many
outputs. Before production, resources (such as land, water, space, etc.) need
to be distributed to workplaces to be available to the laborers as production
inputs. After production, the outputs (goods and services) need to be
distributed to those who consume them. An economy comprises the
production and distribution of productive resources and production's
outputs. As a way of organizing the production and distribution of a
society's goods and services, socialism differs from capitalism and indeed
from many other economic systems. In socialism, the whole community of
people served by, and living with, or in, an economy participate
democratically in producing and distributing goods and services. In slavery,
this is clearly not the case. In a slave economy, participants are divided into
masters and slaves. Masters control (and literally own) the productive
inputs, including the laborers themselves, and decide the fate of slaves in
both production and distribution. In feudalism, economic participants are
divided into lords and serfs. The latter are not property as in slavery, but
they occupy social positions based on the feudal positions of their parents.

Children of serfs are likewise usually serfs, and often of the same lord or his
children. Children of lords become lords or
find associated positions within the feudal economy. Like masters, lords
exercise a socially dominant power that derives in large part from their
position in relation to production and distribution. Masters and lords are
usually few, relative to the numbers of slaves and serfs. Capitalism is
different from slavery, feudalism, and socialism. Capitalism divides
participants in production and distribution into employers and employees.
Employers are few; employees are many. Employers direct and control
employees' work with regard to the production and distribution of goods
and services. Employees are not anyone's property, nor are they bound to
the land or to the employer of their parents. They are "free" in the sense that
they can voluntarily enter into a contract to work for any employer they
choose who is hiring employees. Hiring is the purchase of an employee's
"labor power" — a person's ability to work over a specific period of time.
Labor power is paid for with products or money called a "wage." Wages did
not exist in slavery or feudalism, as the relationship of the two primary
groups involved in those systems generally secured the work of one for the
other without a labor contract. Another different economic system entails
individuals working alone, say as farmers, craftspersons, service providers,
etc. In producing and distributing resources and products, such persons
work individually. Their economy displays no dichotomy of the sorts
encountered in slavery (master/slave), feudalism (lord/serf), or capitalism
(employer/employee). Likewise, such an economy is not socialist since it
does not entail the democratic and collective decision-making in production
and distribution that would occur in a socialist
system. Typically called "self-employed" in modern economic terminology,
such an economy of individual producers is found throughout much of
human history, often occurring alongside and interacting with slave, feudal,
capitalist, or socialist systems. Indeed, it is important here to note that
actually existing economies, past and present, often display coexisting
economic systems. Thus, the US had capitalism in the North and slavery in
the South before the Civil War. Likewise, today capitalist corporations (with
boards of directors functioning as employers within them) coexist and
interact with self-employed lawyers, architects, graphic designers, and so

on, who are operating within a different, non-capitalist (i.e., non-
employer/employee) economic system. In both these examples, there are
market-exchange relations between participants in the two different,
coexisting economic systems. In other words, while their organizations of
production are different — capitalist in the corporation, self-employment in
the lawyer's office — they share the same distribution system: namely,
market exchange. Socialism allows such coexisting systems as well. What
the USSR called its socialist (i.e., state-owned and -operated) enterprises
could and did enter into market-exchange relationships with private
capitalist corporations located, say, in Europe. China's socialist enterprises
(i.e., state-owned and - operated) today engage in market exchanges with
private capitalist enterprises inside and outside China. There are many such
examples, because many existing national economies include more than one
kind of economic system, and these different systems interact both
nationally and internationally.
Socialist economic systems differ in important ways from capitalist
systems, but here we must acknowledge that socialists disagree about those
differences. Indeed, so do non-socialists, and often in similar ways. Since
we will encounter these disagreements repeatedly in this book, we spell
them out here. One concept of socialism differentiates it from capitalism by
the economic interventions of the state. For this concept of socialism,
capitalism is a system of employers and employees such that both kinds of
people have no position within the state. Thus their enterprises are referred
to as "private." A capitalist economy exists if and when all or most
enterprises producing and distributing resources and products are such
private capitalist enterprises. Usually, in this view, the interactions among
private enterprises, their hired laborers, and their customers are all
exchanges in what this view labels a "free market." Like the word "private"
applied to the enterprise, the word "free" applied to the market is meant to
signal that the state as a social institution does not intervene (or intervenes
minimally) in the production and distribution of goods and services.
Capitalism in this approach is defined as private enterprises plus free
markets. It then follows that if and when a state intervenes or interferes in
such private enterprises and/or free markets, capitalism is at least
compromised or at most transformed into socialism. Since society
intervenes through the agency of the state, this first kind of socialism names

that "social intervention." Many libertarians, for example, believe that
capitalism is compromised to the extent that it allows or admits state
economic interventions. Where capitalism
displays problems, libertarians' solutions tend to favor moving closer to the
goals of fully private enterprises and free markets. In this model, the extent
of the state's intervention — from taxation and regulation to state-owned
and -operated enterprises — defines the degree of socialism and its distance
from capitalism. True, or "pure," capitalism exists when state interventions
are near zero. For some variants of this perspective, socialism exists when
the state's interventions are substantial or pervasive. For other variants,
socialism exists in each individual state economic intervention: a
government-run post office, a minimum wage imposed on employers, a
progressive individual income tax, and so on. This latter perspective leads
to notions that modern capitalism is actually a "mixed" system in which
capitalism and socialism coexist. There are disagreements among
proponents of these different variants. An example of great importance over
the last century concerns the following debate: If the state merely regulates
enterprises that otherwise remain private (owned and operated by private
citizens with no position in the state apparatus), this is not socialism. Only
if the state additionally owns and operates enterprises, at least within major
sectors of the economy (sometimes called "the commanding heights"), does
socialism exist. For decades, many referred to the Soviet Union as
"socialist" because most of its industries were dominated by state-owned
and -operated enterprises. In contrast, people hesitated to apply "socialist"
to countries where state economic interventions were considerable but
mostly excluded state-owned and -operated enterprises. A variation on this
sort of thinking called the latter "socialist" and the former "communist."
This reflected the post-1917 split in
world socialism over the USSR's embrace of state-owned and -operated
industrial enterprises. Socialists critical of or opposed to the USSR's form
of socialism kept the name "socialist" while those who saw the USSR as the
model for post-capitalist socialism took the name "communist." That split
proved very influential in much thinking about capitalism versus socialism
across the 20th century. "Communism" became the widely accepted name
for that kind of socialism that went beyond taxation and regulation to add

the all-important direct state ownership and operation of enterprises. The
socialists who joined and built communist parties advocated going beyond
taxation, government spending on public services, and regulation to include
state ownership and operation of many or all enterprises. Other socialists
instead celebrated private, market capitalism where the state taxed, spent,
regulated, and redistributed income and wealth more equally but did not
own and operate many enterprises. The parties of such folk kept the
"socialist" name and often stressed their commitments to political freedoms
and civil liberties — in contrast to the practices of the communist systems,
first in the USSR and later elsewhere as well. The Great Depression of
1929-1941 added more layers of controversy and confusion around the
name "socialism." The depth and duration of that capitalist crash provoked
a whole new economics named after John Maynard Keynes. This new
economics was devoted to rescuing capitalism from itself by both
explaining the causes of capitalism's depressions and also offering policies
(monetary and fiscal) to moderate, contain, and limit them. These were
policies designed to be
implemented by state authorities like central banks or government
treasurers intervening in the economy. Champions of capitalism were often
horrified by Keynesian economics. To many, such policies seemed yet
another assault on private enterprise and free markets, another celebration
of state intervention in the economy, another kind of socialism. These
people scoffed at Keynesians' frequent response that they aimed to save
capitalism from itself. Keynesians insisted that the recurring depressions
afflicting private capitalism, if not moderated by Keynesian state
interventions, would eventually turn the working class against capitalism
and thus end it. Keynes's pro-capitalist critics feared the power of the state
more than the risk of recurring depressions. Despite Keynes's own repeated
rejection of and distaste for socialism, communism, Marxism, and so on, to
this day many closely associate Keynesian economics with socialism. The
issue of the state has always loomed large in defining socialism and its
difference from capitalism. Modem capitalism came into the world
oppressed and limited by the absolute monarchies of late European
feudalism. Eventually, capitalism opposed these monarchies and then
overthrew them. In France, the antagonist of the 1789 revolution was King
Louis XVI; the American Revolution targeted King George III. Late

feudalism's strong states were feared enemies. But anxieties about strong
states persisted in capitalism long after feudalism had been defeated and
discarded. The reason for these anxieties was and remains mass or universal
suffrage. When working-class people become the
majority of voters electing parliaments and other state officials, capitalism's
champions sense trouble and risk. Employees may and likely will blame
their suffering (unemployment, low wages, bad working conditions, poor
housing, etc.) on capitalist employers. Employees will recognize that their
votes can empower a state apparatus to reduce or end that suffering. Tax
structures, regulations of enterprises and markets, and other state
interventions in the capitalist system can alter the distributions of income,
wealth, and power from what they would be without such state
interventions. Universal suffrage can enable the majority (employees) to
offset the inequalities flowing from a capitalist economy dominated by a
minority (employers). For the champions of private capitalism, the risks of
a state powerful enough to impose taxes, regulations, and wealth
redistribution through universal suffrage is as frightening now as feudal
absolute monarchies were at capitalism's birth. Modern capitalism wrestles
with a contradiction: It needs a strong state apparatus — for coordination,
external and internal security, managing externalities and the business
cycle, and so on — and it fears the same. In the wake of the Great
Depression in the US, public opinion favored state interventions such as the
New Deal. Forty years later, the so-called Reagan revolution ushered in a
neoliberalism that sought to minimize state interventions in the economy.
After the 2008 crash of capitalism, economists Paul Krugman and Joseph
Stiglitz are urging a re-evaluation of the benefits of state intervention. But
not everyone agrees. Capitalism's history did not produce only one socialist
opposition with a shared focus on the state;
it also produced socialist dissenters. These dissenters also disliked
capitalism and thought human society could and should do better, but they
rejected the state and state intervention as the focal point of the contest
between capitalism and socialism. While such dissenters have always
hovered around the edges of the socialist movement, what brought them
into the center of debate were the difficulties encountered by the early
experiments in actual socialist economies. With an eye to the USSR after

1917, as early revolutionary enthusiasm and social transformations gave
way first to Stalinism in the 1930s and then the implosion of 1989, the
problematic relation of socialism to a powerful state took center stage.
Many socialist critics of capitalism saw the state in the USSR as having
itself become an obstacle to the kinds of social progress socialists
championed. The social costs of the rapid economic development the USSR
achieved were too large to deny or keep tolerating. Views arose that the
socialism of the USSR and its socialist allies had given the state too much
power and transformed the rest of socialist society too little. The key
questions became: Why did this failure happen, and what is to be done
about it? Struggling to answer these questions brought another kind of
socialism to the forefront among socialists. In this interpretation of
socialism, what defined it was less the role of the state in the economy, and
more the organization of production in the workplace. The key issue of this
kind of socialism is how human beings collaborate inside workplaces
(factories, offices, stores) to produce the goods and perform the services
that society needs or wants.
In capitalism, the participants in production are divided into employers and
employees. In this alternative view of socialism, such should not be the
case. The key term here is "should," because such a socialist organization of
production has not yet been undertaken on a society-wide basis. Traditional
socialisms concentrated on state activities — taxation, regulation, and state
ownership and operation of workplaces — not on transforming the human
relations within those workplaces. Indeed, traditional socialisms had taken
over the basic employer-versus-employee organization of production from
capitalism and changed it little if at all. Instead, socialist states taxed and
regulated workplaces that had retained their capitalist organization
(employer/employee) and sometimes also replaced private individuals with
state officials as employers. Socialist workplaces could and should be
fundamentally different from capitalist workplaces in this alternative view
of socialism. In capitalist workplaces, a small group (owners, boards of
directors selected by owners, etc.) makes all the key decisions. In so doing,
they are not accountable to the mass of employees or others affected by
those decisions. In their internal organization, capitalist workplaces were
and are still fundamentally undemocratic. They exclude majorities from
power as surely and completely as monarchies exclude their subjects. The

socialist alternative to capitalist organization entails the democratization of
a workplace's internal structure. Every employee now has one constituent
voice — equal to all other employees — in deciding what the workplace
produces, what technology it uses, where production occurs, and what is
done with the net revenues or surplus generated. In effect, in this model the
employees become collectively their own
employer. The age-old dichotomies of masters and slaves, lords and serfs,
and employers and employees are finally displaced and overcome here.
This conception of socialism thus represents a fundamental historical break
from the slave, feudal, and capitalist systems. In this perspective, socialism
has pivoted from a largely macroeconomic to a primarily microeconomic
focus. Socialism accomplishes the transition from capitalism by rebuilding
the economy from the bottom up. Traditional socialisms never took this step
on a society-wide basis of laying the foundation for an enduring economic
system meant to replace capitalism. The early efforts at transition from
capitalism to socialism stopped short at macro-changes — socializing
means of production so they became state-owned and -operated,
substituting centralized planning for markets as the major distributional
mechanism, etc. — and never got to the micro-level. Traditional socialisms
thus failed to target or include the micro-level democratic transformation of
the workplace. That failure to complete the socialist revolution likely
contributed to undermining the survival of those early, incomplete
transitions from capitalism. This is not surprising. Incomplete transitions
have been the norm in the passages from slavery to feudalism or capitalism,
from feudalism to capitalism, and so on. The emancipation of slaves during
the US Civil War, for example, led to various subsequent relations of
production — sharecropping, dependent tenancies, and so on — that fell far
short of the economic freedom ex-slaves sought. Such was similarly the
case with the early breaks from feudalism that led to capitalism.
Each economic system produces multiple forms that experience more or
less successful transitions to new systems in different ways and at different
paces. Many early experiments in transitioning from one economic system
to another teach lessons that may help, if conditions permit, in assembling
the means for a complete transition to a different system at some point in
the future. There is little reason to expect that the transition from capitalism

to socialism will be different in this respect. As has been the case with other
economic transitions in history, the move away from capitalism has
involved, and will continue to involve, more or less successful efforts, trials
and errors, and steps forward and backward, until lessons learned combine
with evolved conditions to enable the complete transition to socialism.
Socialists have learned crucial lessons from the Russian, Chinese, Cuban,
and other revolutions of the 20th century. The economic systems
constructed and tried by those revolutionaries have taught yet more lessons.
The accumulated theories and practices of the socialist tradition have today
been filtered through the conditions of a changing global capitalism to
propel the tradition in new directions. Thus, today's socialism is
characterized by both old notions and strategies, and new ones focused on
democratizing workplaces.
Chapter III
Capitalism and Socialism: Struggles and Transitions
Human beings have had many different economic systems in their history.
Transitions among them occurred in all directions. Changes in nature
(climate, resource exhaustion, earthquakes, and so on) influenced those
transitions, as did changes in technologies and social conflicts (wars, class
struggles, migrations). Along the way in each particular system, beliefs that
it was the final or permanent system eventually proved wrong. Change is as
continually present in economic systems as in everything else. Kinship or
tribal economic systems, with collectively owned property alongside
collective production and distribution of goods and services, gave way to
private, individually owned and operated systems, and vice versa. Both of
those sometimes gave way to slave systems, and again vice versa. Those in
turn experienced transition to feudal
(lord/serf) or capitalist (employer/employee) systems, and so on. Capitalist
systems appeared and disappeared locally and repeatedly in human history
before becoming regionally, nationally, and now globally prevalent. To
imagine that today's capitalist system will last forever contradicts the
history of every other system as well as of capitalist systems that arose and
fell in the past. Hopefully, our collective knowledge of the different systems

and transitions among them can limit and shape future transitions (as we
seem to have done in precluding transitions back to slave and feudal
systems). No sooner did modern capitalism emerge in transitions out of
feudalism and individual (self-employment) economic systems in Europe,
out of a slave system in a large part of the US, and out of a variety of
systems in the rest of the world, than it was challenged by another
transition: socialism. Advocates of socialism sought transition beyond
capitalism while capitalism's defenders tried to prevent any such change.
Over the last two centuries a widespread theme of politics, economics, and
culture was a struggle between advocates of capitalism and socialism over
transitions between the systems. For most of the 19th century, capitalism
seemed in the ascendancy; the possibility of transition to socialism, small.
By the end of that century, that possibility had grown markedly stronger.
Transition to socialism had become an explicit goal of socialist political
parties then active in capitalism's major centers (Western Europe and North
America). Across the 20th century, socialism shadowed capitalism around
the world. Socialists in both colonizing (capitalist) and colonized (non-
capitalist) territories began to see possibilities of transitions to socialism.
In nations where socialist or communist parties gained sufficient
government power, transitions became official policy. Debates over the
forms, mechanisms, and paces of transition proliferated. Debaters often
took clues from what was known about earlier transitions between
economic systems. Of particular interest was the transition from feudalism
to capitalism in Europe after the 15th century. The basic lessons drawn by
socialists from past transitions between economic systems was captured in
Marx's succinct phrase: "The history of all hitherto existing societies is the
history of class struggles." Slavery was beset by struggles between masters
and slaves, feudalism by struggles between lords and serfs, and capitalism
by struggles between employers and employees. Those class struggles
shaped the quality and history of each type of economic system and thus of
the societies in which those systems existed. Class struggles are always key
contributors to eventual transitions to different economic systems. The
feudal system had its internal contradictions that generated conflicts
between lords and serfs over labor and rental obligations, soil exhaustion
from feudal cultivation techniques, wars among lords, and so on. The
struggles provoked by such contradictions produced two noteworthy results

internal to European feudalism. The first was a transition in which a
decentralized structure of lords and serfs on small and medium-sized
manors gave way to increasingly large, concentrated manors organized as a
hierarchy with a huge feudal manor at the top. The lords of those top
manors became the kings of the so-called absolute monarchies of late
European feudalism.
The second result of European feudalism's contradictions disconnected serfs
from manors (via revolts, escapes, changed farming practices, etc.). Such
displaced serfs lost their access to manorial resources, and thus urgently
sought means of survival by finding and settling with other feudal outsiders.
Among these were bands of outlaws living off plunder: the Robin Hood
model. Other serfs, instead, joined with merchants: a group, neither lord nor
serf, that existed by engaging in trade. Merchants exchanged goods with
lords and serfs, often moving them from where they were relatively
plentiful and cheap to where they were scarce and expensive. When
merchants needed help to secure or expand their trading, they began to enter
into a new and different relationship with serfs disconnected from feudal
manors. They struck a deal: merchants advanced to disconnected serfs the
means for their survival in exchange for the serfs providing their ability to
work for the merchant as the merchant directed. Employer and employee
came into existence alongside lord and serf. In that deal, capitalism, a non-
feudal economic system, arrived. It featured a new relationship in the
production and distribution of goods and services different from the feudal
one. In the feudal system, the serf was bound to the lord across generations.
The bond — an intense personal connection of the serf and his/her family to
the land and its feudal lord and lord's family — was all the stronger because
church rituals sanctified it. In contrast, the employer and employee were
both "free" persons bound by neither personal nor religious connection.
Instead, they entered voluntarily into a contractual relation governing the
exchange between them. They exchanged what was private property to
each:
commodities or money owned by the employer (accumulated by the
merchant) and the ability to do labor (or labor power) owned by the
employee. The employer purchased labor power and combined it (in
production) with other inputs (tools, equipment, raw materials, etc.)

likewise purchased by the employer. During production, the worker's labor
added value to the value already embodied in the other inputs that got used
up in production. The outputs of production contained a total value equal to
the sum of the used-up inputs' value and the value added by the laborers.
The employer sold the outputs and thereby obtained their value in
exchange. Money was usually the measure and means of exchange. With
that total value in hand, the employer typically replaced the used-up inputs
and paid the employee what had been contractually agreed upon: the wage.
This typically left the employer with some "extra" or "surplus" value. That
was because the value added by the worker usually exceeded the value of
the wage paid to the worker. That excess was the employer's gain - often
called "profit." Profit was the employers' incentive, their "bottom line," and
thus capitalism's driving force. The concept of "capital" had long defined
the use of money to make more money (as moneylenders and merchants
did). Because the employer/employee production system did exactly that
too, it came to be called "capitalism." In this capitalist, employer/employee
relationship in production, what the capitalist offered was privately owned
wealth (perhaps inherited, stolen, accumulated from merchantry or
moneylending, or saved from wages). But the
capitalist only offered that wealth on condition that combining it with labor
power in production would yield a surplus value for the capitalist. In other
words, the seller of labor power needed to accept — knowingly or
unknowingly — a payment (wage or salary) that had less value than what
the worker's labor added to the other inputs used during the production
process. It is this core mechanism that generates struggles between
employers and employees. Employers want to pay less value to workers to
acquire their labor power. That is because the less paid to workers, the
greater the surplus or excess of value added by the worker in production
over the value paid for the worker's labor power. That surplus is the
employer's goal and means of competitive survival. In contrast, workers
want more value paid to them for their labor power, as that enables their
standard of living and that of all others dependent upon them. Class
struggles between employers and employees follow. They have dogged
capitalism everywhere and throughout its history. Sooner or later, European
struggles between lords and serfs grew and matured from disputing only
their respective obligations within the feudal system to questioning,

challenging, and eventually overthrowing the feudal system itself. Along
the way, revolutionary serfs found allies among the employers and
employees that established enclaves of capitalism within the larger feudal
society. Serfs seeking to leave feudal manors found refuge in the villages,
towns, and cities where capitalist economic relationships existed and were
accepted. The latter grew accordingly and so did the threat they represented
to feudal lords, who often crushed the
many large and small capitalist experiments in those villages and towns
(e.g., Emperor Frederick I's wars against the city-states of northern Italy in
the 12th century). There were centuries of trials and errors, countless efforts
to construct and sustain capitalist economic systems surrounded by more or
less hostile feudal manors (e.g., the enclosures in Britain). Slowly a
reluctant feudalism accepted coexistence with a rising capitalism.
Eventually, the capitalist employers and employees allied with increasingly
anti-feudal serfs to make revolutions against absolute feudal monarchs and
thereby complete the transition from feudalism to capitalism. A parallel
pattern characterizes the growth and maturation of capitalism's struggles
between employees and employers. Socialism is the form that maturity
took. Socialism represents the awareness of employees that their sufferings
and limitations come less from the employers than from the capitalist
system. It is that system that prescribes for both sides the incentives and
options, the rewards and punishments for their behavioral "choices." It is
that system that generates their endless struggles and the employees' slow-
dawning realization that system change — transition from capitalism to
socialism — is the way out. Most employers have understood for a long
time that socialists were their enemies. Even as socialists' ideas changed,
what they wanted for employees seemed almost always to be contrary to
what employers wanted or felt they could tolerate. In the 19th and 20th
centuries, when socialists seemed to want more state economic intervention,
employers mostly feared where that might lead in terms of constricting their
freedom to profit from employing workers. Only during
capitalist depressions (especially the 1930s) or when socialist political
movements were very strong did employers relent and make some
concessions to keep the capitalist system in place. Faced with the rapid rise
of socialism in Germany, Otto von Bismarck and his successors undertook a

state welfare system and eventually allowed labor unions. In the US,
socialism's rise likewise propelled Franklin Roosevelt to legalize labor
unions; begin Social Security, unemployment insurance, and massive
federal jobs programs; as well as institute a minimum wage. In both these
cases, however, the basic capitalist employer-versus-employee system was
maintained. Socialist movements, organizations, political parties, and
spokespersons were repeatedly silenced, imprisoned, and crushed.
International opposition and isolation greeted the Soviet Union after 1917
and the People's Republic of China after 1949. The US after World War II
and Germany after 1968 purged many socialists from government,
academic, and other social institutions. The US under Trump has been
trying to revive an anti-Chinese bloc since 2018. For at least the last
century, socialist efforts to mount political movements, take power, and
develop socialist economic systems have suffered ideological, political,
economic, and military destruction around the world. This was usually led
by the US in an effort to protect capitalism and the democracy and freedom
it allegedly generates. Over more or less the same time period, the transition
from capitalism to socialism was seen, from both sides, as a movement
from a system of private enterprises and markets to a system of state
enterprises and state planning. With some
important exceptions, that movement seemed ascendant from 1917 to 1989,
while the reverse movement has seemed dominant since. The implosion of
the USSR seemed the nodal turning point. Most socialists celebrated the
transition from private to state enterprises and from markets to planning as
central components of building a new socialist society. They were
optimistic that society's ownership of the means of production by the state
and planned distribution of resources and products by the state would
finally end the unequal distributions of income and wealth typical of
capitalism. It would similarly avoid capitalist instability by preventing
business cycles through government planning. The irrationality of
unemployment would be eliminated, and technological advances would
enable a growing shift from work to leisure within each day. Freedom
would then come to mean freedom from exploitation because work itself
was reduced as a portion of one's life and because the workers were
producing surpluses not for others (i.e., the employer/capitalist class), but
rather for their own representatives in a democratic workers' state. In

contrast, advocates for capitalism saw transitions to socialism as retreats
from the freedoms and standards of living achieved by capitalism. Workers
in socialism, they warned, would have only one employer and thus lack the
freedom to leave one employer for another, which existed in private
capitalism. More problematic still, they argued, was the power concentrated
in the proposed socialism's state apparatus (especially when one, single
political party controlled that apparatus). It would be the owner and
operator
of workplaces, the planner who distributed resources among them, and the
distributor of outputs among all who wanted them. Such concentrated
economic power within the state could make it dictatorial within socialist
societies, thus extinguishing civil liberties and individual rights. Critics of
socialism along these lines characterized the state powers inside the USSR,
the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, Cuba, and so on, as dictatorships.
The 20th century's "great debate" between capitalism and socialism was
distinguished by the former's private enterprises and markets versus the
latter's public enterprises and central planning. Where governments taxed
and regulated private capitalist enterprises (but did not own and operate
them) and regulated markets (but did not replace them with planning), the
term "socialist" was retained. In contrast, "communist" designated that kind
of socialism in which state-owned and - operated enterprises prevailed and
markets either disappeared or were controlled by central planning
authorities. "Socialist" thus came to be used for many countries in
Scandinavia, other parts of Western Europe, and Asia. "Communist"
described countries like the USSR and its Eastern European allies, the
People's Republic of China, Vietnam, Cuba, and so on. These usages were
not universally agreed upon, but they were more widespread than
alternative usages. On one level that great debate ended in 1989 with the
implosion of the USSR and its Eastern European allies, along with major
economic changes in many of the other communist economies. A kind of
capitalist triumphalism advanced the idea that capitalism had won and
socialism had
lost. For many of capitalism's enthusiasts "no alternative" could outcompete
capitalism. A kind of "end of history" had set in so far as economic systems
were concerned. However, the great crash of 2008 (capitalism's second

worst after the Great Depression of the 1930s) showed that capitalist
triumphalism was mistaken. Criticisms of capitalism resumed alongside
heightened class struggles. Also after 1989, many socialists felt the need to
explain what had caused the implosion of the 20th century's efforts to
construct socialist economies in Eastern Europe. Explanations emerged and
sometimes extended to asking whether the very notions of socialism needed
to be re-examined. Might there need to be changes in 21st-century
socialism's goals and strategies based on lessons learned from its 20th-
century experiments and efforts? A debate arose among socialists that
continues to the present. Broadly speaking, one side holds on to the 20th-
century conventions: that socialism entails either the socialization of the
means of production plus central planning, or a democratic government that
regulates private capitalism and markets for social goals. The other side
criticizes both those conventions, claiming they may not be necessary and
they are definitely not sufficient. With or without socialized ownership and
planning or government regulation, 21st-century socialism focuses on and
prioritizes something else — namely, the transformation of workplaces
from capitalism's hierarchical internal structures to fully democratic worker
cooperatives. The focus of the capitalism-versus-socialism debate is being
basically challenged by the changes within socialism. The role of the state
is no longer the central issue in dispute. Who the
employers are (private citizens or state officials) now matters far less than
what kind of relationship exists between employers and employees in the
workplace. Are they different groups of people such that one hires/fires the
other, one produces a surplus and the other appropriates it one makes all the
key decisions and the other either accepts them without participating in
them or else leaves to find employment in another, similarly organized
workplace? Or are they cooperative workplaces where the collective of all
workers democratically makes the key decisions: what, how, and where to
produce; how to use profits; and what wages/salaries to pay each individual
worker/collective member? Socialism is shifting such that one of its priority
goals is the transition of workplaces from capitalist hierarchies to
democratic cooperatives. This prioritized goal is to be added to and
emphasized alongside the conventional socialist priority goals. That is,
socialism is becoming the movement to build a new society with equally
important new macroeconomic and microeconomic institutions. In such a

society, new macroeconomic institutions will have likely transitioned from
private to a mix of state and regulated private ownership, and likely from
relatively "free" market distribution to a mix of planning (centralized or
decentralized) and regulated market exchanges. Its new microeconomic
institutions will have transitioned from capitalist, hierarchical ones to
democratic worker co-ops. Socialism will mean and require the advocacy of
social change toward, and the building of, a society in which both these
macro and micro transitions are underway and have been significantly
achieved.
At a certain stage in their development, feudal class struggles between lords
and serfs became about more than the specifics of their relationship (sizes
of feudal dues, rents, corvee labor obligations, and so on). They began to
focus on the feudal class relationship as a whole and began to conceptualize
alternative relations of production and correspondingly different societies
built on them. As struggling serfs grew in consciousness and self-
confidence, they also gained a certain space and acceptance for the
alternative capitalist system to coexist inside feudalism. Eventually
transition occurred, often punctuated by revolutions such as the ones that
occurred in England, America, and France in the 17th and 18th centuries. In
the 21st-century socialism discussed above, a similar transitional trajectory
is envisioned. Within capitalism, employer/employee struggles are
resuming after their declines in the second half of the 20th century. Quickly
they are maturing from capitalism's specifics to systemic concerns with
socialist alternatives. Interest in, and formations of, worker co-ops are
growing fast, as is the self-confidence of socialists. This is remarkable for
two major reasons. First, the two great experiments in transitions beyond
private capitalism in the 20th century - Russia and China - have yielded a
rich crop of lessons, precedents to build on, and tragic detours to avoid.
Resuming the effort of a transition to socialism entails close attention to
those lessons. Second, those two experiments contributed to two great
reactionary purges that targeted socialism in the 20th century: fascism
before World War II and anti-communism afterwards. The legacies of those
purges
continue to impact socialism today, creating both obstacles and
opportunities for the transition to socialism in the years ahead. In any case,

that transition is once again front and center on the historical agenda.
Chapter IV
Russia and China: Major Experiments in Constructing Socialism
Socialism took a huge step when socialists achieved, for the first time, what
so many socialists had long wished for. In 1917 socialists in Russia
emerged from the chaos of the czar's loss in World War I with an effective
combination of revolutionary theory, strategies, and tactics. A small, well-
organized political party enabled them to "seize the state." From that
position they undertook to construct what they understood to be the world's
first socialist government and society, the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics (USSR). From a set of Utopian dreams of a world better than that
provided by early capitalism, socialism had grown with (and because of)
capitalism to become its systemic critic. Along the way, socialist criticism
developed both theoretical and practical expressions: the British Chartists,
Proudhon's ideas,
Marx's life's work, the Revolutions of 1848, the German Socialist Party. A
groundswell of people, their organizations and activities, built 19th-century
socialism into a formidable international movement of social criticism and
opposition to capitalism. Then, in the 1917 Russian Revolution and its
aftermath, socialism added something new and different. "Socialism" began
not only to mean the most developed, systematic critique of capitalism, but
also to refer to constructing, operating, and governing a post-capitalist
economic system and society. Something barely begun and lasting only
weeks in the Paris Commune of 1871 was rethought and refashioned in
Russia in 1917. It lasted for over 70 years. In undertaking the experiment of
building a socialist alternative to capitalism, socialism changed itself
profoundly. For example, with the beginning of the experiment, socialism
split into communism and socialism over profound disagreements. Ever
since 1917, socialists and communists offered different but overlapping
critiques of capitalism. They differed also in their evaluations of the new
socialist economies constructed first in, and later also beyond, the USSR.
From the beginning, the new USSR's survival and growth provoked
opposition and anxiety in socialism's enemies, both inside Russia and

internationally. The pro-monarchist, ultra-nationalistic "White Russians"
allied with foreign governments, resulting in a civil war and an invasion by
foreign troops (British, French, Japanese, and American) aimed at defeating
the experiment. Innovation and hostility shaped much of the USSR's first
decades. Later in the century, in 1949, socialists in China undertook a
similar experiment. Revolution took them from an oppositional force
targeting Chinese capitalism to a revolutionary government determined to
construct a new, post-capitalist economic system: the People's Republic of
China (PRC). In some ways, China's socialists replicated inside the PRC the
Soviet experiment inside the USSR. For example, as in the USSR, Chinese
socialism operated mostly within a communist party and focused on state
ownership of the means of industrial production and state central planning.
In other ways, however, China's development as a socialist economy and
society took different directions. For example, since the 1980s, China has
increasingly enabled large private capitalist enterprises, foreign and
domestic, to operate inside the PRC, and relied on exports and the world
market. Together, the USSR and the PRC have represented the most
important national experiments in constructing a socialist economic system
and society. As the largest countries by geography (USSR) and by
population (PRC), they exemplified how far socialism had come in the
historically short span of under two centuries. Together, they showed how
capitalism's global expansion beyond Europe had been matched by
socialism's. The results of these two experiments had, and continue to have,
immense impacts on socialism and capitalism today. In this book, our
approach to the USSR and China focuses on their relationships to an
evolving socialism. We seek to avoid
Cold War denunciations and apologies that so often badly distorted debates
over these topics as each side demonized the other and celebrated itself.
Much of the literature since 1945, and even after the implosions of Eastern
European socialisms in 1989, repeats those lopsided themes. Of course,
every writer's partisanship influences what gets written. Our perspective
should by now be clear. We aim to offer a non-dogmatic, nuanced
assessment of the two greatest experiments to date in constructing socialist
economies. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) In the century
before 1917, Russia was a mostly feudal society in a painful transition to

capitalism. In that process, feudalism was only officially abolished in 1863,
and the capitalism that emerged included a large component of foreign-
owned firms. When Russia entered World War 1 in 1914, it was still a
transitional economy with significant feudal remnants; a fast-growing
capitalist sector; and many tensions among landlords, capitalists, ex-serf
peasants, and an urban working class. The extreme inequalities among them
and widespread desperate poverty had already exploded earlier in 1904-5,
when both a war with Japan was lost and a revolution convulsed large areas
of Russia. Thus, Russia's defeat in World War I finally undermined the
autocratic czarist government at a moment when an emerging capitalism
was still relatively new, brutal, small, and vulnerable to competing
capitalists in far stronger European countries.
Desperate wartime conditions, extreme inequality, and poverty, coupled
with czarist censorship and repression battling winds of parliamentary
democracy and socialism from the West, combined to produce a
revolutionary explosion in 1917. The czarist regime collapsed, and the
Russian capitalists were too weak politically to form a durable replacement
government. The socialist-party faction (Bolsheviks) that led the revolution
had learned lessons from the 1905 revolt (chiefly, the need to build an
alliance with a revolutionary party among the peasant majority). It had also
established a significant presence in the small industrial Russian working
class. Its anti-capitalist message gathered the political strength necessary to
wage the 1917 revolution and establish the USSR as a new society with a
new socialist government. For some, the survival and growth of the new
Soviet society was a kind of validation of socialist movements everywhere.
It was seen that socialists could overturn a hostile government. Socialists
could capture state power and make it serve in the transition from
capitalism to socialism. Others went further: They saw the USSR as the
embryo of a global socialist future. It was an embryo to be nurtured and
supported as a priority for socialists everywhere. Still others worried that
the Soviet version of socialism could or already did clash with the values
and commitments of other socialists. The victorious Bolshevik faction had
long struggled with opposing factions inside Russian socialism. The
milestone represented by the Soviet revolution sharpened differences that
had been maturing inside 19th-century socialism.

Among these differences were deep divisions over how to utilize state
power, once captured, to bring about the transition to socialism. One side
advocated peaceful, parliamentary politics, while the other advocated
revolutionary breakthroughs. Other differences concerned civil liberties and
tolerance for dissent in societies governed by socialists, democratic
governance of workplaces and residential communities, and commitments
to internationalism. Key aspects of the new USSR became flashpoints for
disagreement. Was the concept of a "dictatorship of the proletariat" a
shorthand to define a government's class priorities or a description of how
socialist governors treated the governed? Was socialism necessarily a
transnational movement and society, or could there be "socialism in one
country"? Were anarchists allies or enemies of socialism? These and still
other disagreements among socialists around the world reacting to the
USSR produced the profound split mentioned earlier. Those who stayed
with the idea that the USSR represented socialism's future and deserved
basic support by socialists everywhere broke away from global socialism
and took the name "communist" Those who were more or less critical of the
kind of socialism being constructed in the USSR kept the name "socialist."
In the early 1920s many existing socialist political parties split along these
lines. The socialist movement thereafter included both socialist and
communist political parties. The split provoked parallel divisions among
self-identified socialists outside political parties as well.
In the first decade after the 1917 revolution, the USSR had to face the fact
that, as the only country with a government committed to socialism, it was
alone in the world. Efforts at parallel revolutionary breaks elsewhere in
Europe (Hungary, Bavaria, etc.) had not succeeded. Extraordinary efforts
and sacrifices enabled the Bolsheviks to win the civil war and their newly
formed Communist Party of the Soviet Union to retain leadership. The early
Soviet leadership under Lenin had to grapple with multiple, threatening
crises from the outset: near-total isolation within a hostile world of
capitalism, extreme poverty, urgent needs to recover from the war, and
complicated splits between communists and socialists within and outside
the USSR. Lenin himself admitted that socialism was a goal, not yet an
achieved reality. A socialist party had taken political power, but it still had
not used that power to transform capitalism into a very different socialism.
As Lenin put it, they had achieved "state capitalism." That is, a socialist

party had state power, and the state had become the industrial capitalist
displacing the former private capitalists. But Soviet society was still
capitalist in the employer-employee organization of its economy. He hoped
and worked to guide that state capitalism into a transition to socialism. But
when Lenin died in 1924, the new leadership that emerged (and remained
into the 1950s) revolved around Stalin. The Stalinist period was a period of
nearly constant crises. Foreign hostilities were problems from the
beginning. The 1929 capitalism crash provoked a rising right-wing political
movement (e.g., Nazism and other fascisms) that targeted Bolshevism.
Internally, the initial revolutionary distribution of land to the peasants had
produced a peasantry — the majority inside the USSR — with quite
different goals and objectives than those of the government. Stalin's state
saw rapid industrialization as the top Soviet priority, in order to: (1) defend
the USSR's socialism against the hostile industrialized economies
threatening it from outside; (2) deliver on the political promise to rapidly
modernize Soviet society as a whole; and (3) recover from the damages of
World War I, revolution, civil war, and foreign invasions (1914 to 1922).
Stalinism came to be the name for the Soviet government's harsh,
sometimes violent, determination to achieve these goals against any and all
opposition, real and often imagined. This entailed constricting consumption
to free the maximum possible resources for industrialization. Stalinism also
constricted civil liberties; artistic expression; theoretical debates over
socialism's diverse interpretations; and many early Soviet experiments in
politics, culture, and economics where revolutionaries sought to
institutionalize concepts of socialism. For example, initial Soviet
experiments to free women from the subordination and drudgeries of
patriarchal households inherited from the feudal and capitalist past were
abandoned as "socially too disruptive," in much the same way as the
Soviets renounced the early efforts at democratizing workplaces. Amid
Stalinism's pressures, questioning basic Soviet strategy became taboo. The
benefits of Stalinism in preparing for and defeating Hitler's attack, in rapid
industrialization, etc., have been debated against Stalinism's internal costs
in political repression, cultural uniformity, neglect of agriculture, etc., to
this day.

The development of the USSR, led by its Communist Party, has sharpened
certain differences among socialists — often expressed by disagreements
between socialists and communists — since the 1920s. Many socialists
outside the USSR pursued a transition beyond capitalism by means of
parliamentary politics. Their socialist parties embraced peaceful change, to
be achieved by winning elections. Once the state apparatus had been won
for the socialist party, it would proceed to shift ownership of the means of
production from private to state. However, this would be a long, slow
process during which private capitalist enterprises would coexist with a
slowly expanding state sector. At the same time, the socialist state would
regulate or replace market exchange with its own centrally planned
distribution of resources and products. That, too, would be a long, slow
process. Other socialists formed other socialist parties that promoted a
shorter, faster transitional path. They formulated programs of rapid
nationalization of industry, deeper market regulation, and more systemic
planning. They foresaw the need for a rapid redistribution of wealth and
income to solidify their political base as well as a speedy transition. They
generally wanted more extensive and rapid implementation of the
following: rising minimum wages; progressive taxation of property and
income; and subsidized national health care, housing, education, and
transport. In contrast, communists and the communist parties they
organized advocated a socialism that insisted on more or less immediate
state ownership and operation of most, or at least "the commanding
heights," of industry, and often parts of agriculture too. The USSR, for
example, despite keeping the
word "socialist" in the country's name, followed the communist model and
nationalized most industries and. after 1930. an important part of
agriculture ("state farms"). After World War II. the communist model based
on the Soviet experience tended to be followed by many new socialist
governments in Asia (China and Vietnam). Europe (the USSR's Eastern
European allies), and Latin America (Cuba). Communist political parties
around the world — loosely connected in "Communist Internationals" —
celebrated the Soviet model and criticized the socialist alternative. The
socialists generally did the reverse. Despite the socialist/communist split,
many on both sides endorsed the old, pre-split idea that socialism was the
first stage of the transition beyond capitalism, whereas communism was a

later stage. Some held socialism to be an in-between stage: no longer
capitalist but not yet communist. A remark by Marx often served to
summarize the difference: In socialism, the rule governing work and the
distribution of income is "from each according to his/her ability and to each
according to his/her work." In communism it will be "from each according
to his/her ability and to each according to his/her need." Such shared
perspectives help explain why Soviet-type economies often run by
communist parties called their economies "socialist" (as both the USSR and
PRC consistently did). Likewise, where socialists governed economies that
retained a mostly private capitalist system (for example, many countries in
Western Europe at various times) in a slow and uneven transition, their
socialist parties also referred to their own economies as "socialist."
The actual economic history of the USSR has been far more complex than
one might guess from the Cold War depictions dominating the literature.
For example — and contrary to the idea that communists always reject
private property — one of the first acts of the new Soviet government
formed in 1917 was to divide and give land to the mass of landless peasants
as their private property. At that point, land was by far the most important
"means of production" in the economy. Even after the later collectivization
of agriculture around 1930 (when state farms began their steady growth in
importance), the many "collective farms" were private, not state, operations.
In addition, Stalin had to allow effective private property on the peasants'
"individual plots." The notion that the USSR banned all private property is
false. Likewise, the notion that the USSR eliminated markets in favor of
central planning is false. What did happen was that widespread market
transactions were allowed and encouraged within the larger framework of a
central economic plan. Some market exchanges occurred at prices set
administratively by planners, while others were freely negotiated among
buyers and sellers. Across Soviet history, policies came and went that gave
more or less freedom to market exchanges relative to central plans.
Rejecting Cold War caricatures still leaves the problem of deciding how
best to characterize the actual economic system in the USSR. Was it
genuinely post-capitalist, and if so, was it sodalist? If it was not socialist,
what was it? Given the central role played by the USSR in the 20th
century's so-called great debate between capitalism and socialism, deciding
what the

USSR actually was is to take a position in and on that debate as well. In the
wake of the 1917 revolution, the new Soviet government took actions
drawn from the thinking and the platforms of 19th-century European
socialism. It nationalized industry (but not agriculture). It closed the stock
market. It established a central government economic-planning institution
charged with organizing the distribution of resources among workplaces,
and products among the workplaces and consumers who wanted them. It
established regulations and goals that drove the economy to (1) recover
from the devastations of 1914-1922, (2) build up industrial capacity to
overcome economic underdevelopment and military vulnerabilities, and (3)
provide rising standards of living for the population. In place of profit
maximization for capitalists and elite consumption standards for Russia's
top one percent, the Soviet system prioritized industrialization and growth.
It proved far more successful at achieving goals (1) and (2) than (3). But
were industries in the USSR socialist or capitalist? If the criterion to answer
this question is whether they were owned and operated by private citizens
or state officials, then they were socialist, because the Soviet state owned
and operated them. Suppose instead that the criterion is whether the
relations of production were hierarchical and dichotomous in the private
capitalist manner: an employer minority hired an employee majority. Then
the Soviet industrial system would have to be deemed capitalist since a
minority of persons — Soviet state officials — functioned as employers of
an employee majority. It would be state capitalism because the
employers were state officials and thus different from private capitalism
where employers are NOT state officials. There is no question that Soviet
industry was predominantly hierarchical and dichotomous. In Soviet
industrial workplaces, a state official was placed in the position of
employer, through the agency of leaders of the state and the Communist
Party. In private capitalism, the position of employer is occupied either by
the individual(s) who own(s) and organize(s) the workplace or by corporate
boards of directors elected by shareholders with one vote per share owned.
The Soviet revolution had changed who the employer was; it had not ended
the employer/employee relationship. In place of private capitalism, the
Soviet revolution had established a state capitalism. The notion that
capitalism displays both state and private forms should come as no surprise.
Historically, the slave and feudal economic systems before modern

capitalism likewise displayed both private and state forms. Alongside or
instead of private masters who owned slaves, states and state officials could
and did own slaves. Local feudal lords across medieval Europe had serfs,
but so did the lords who operated as state officials, e.g., kings. Historians do
not find the presence of state forms of slavery or feudalism alongside (or
instead of) their private forms as signs that those societies no longer deserve
the labels slave or feudal — quite the contrary. Capitalism, too, displays
both private and state forms in varying proportions. The USSR constructed
a largely state-capitalist economy. Given its early circumstances — poverty
and economic underdevelopment, war and post-war economic destruction,
global isolation and hostility — state capitalism was as far as Lenin and
others felt they could proceed toward socialism. Socialists had achieved a
revolutionary government and taken control of a major nation's industry.
They were in a good position to make the further transition from state
capitalism to socialism. During the 1920s, the USSR achieved economic
recovery from the disasters of 1914-1922. It also allowed and supported
private enterprises, especially merchants and farmers, under what Lenin
named the New Economic Policy (NEP). By the end of the 1920s, those
private enterprises had grown. Some remained self-employed individuals,
while others became small capitalists (an employer/employee structure).
Under Stalin, however, private interests and the Stalinist notion of a
transition from capitalism to socialism clashed. The Soviet government then
suppressed much of what Lenin's NEP had produced. It collectivized
agriculture, pressing the peasants who had acquired their own land in the
1917 revolution into newly organized private collective farms and state
farms. Many of those peasants — and especially those who had become
richer and often employers of others who had lost their land — resisted
collectivization as a program depriving them of their private property.
Stalin's government responded harshly, and violence ensued as
collectivization was completed. On collective farms, farmers sometimes
functioned as small self-employed individuals and sometimes as small,
medium, or even large cooperatives. The structures of these agricultural
cooperatives sometimes came very close to having workers become the
collective owners and operators of their farms. The collective farms often
reproduced the employer/employee structure of capitalism

with the difference that employees had some (varying) influence on the
employers. In contrast Soviet state farms adopted the same
employer/employee structure that had been established in industry: state
capitalism. For many years, private collective and state farms coexisted in
the USSR. However, so strong was the attachment of Soviet farmers to
"their own piece of land" that such pieces were set aside for them on
collective and state farms. These were, in effect, the private property of
individual farmers (and their families) who could work them, sell the
produce in local markets, and retain the resulting revenues. Thus, the Soviet
class structure was indeed complicated. State capitalism in industry and
agriculture coexisted with private self-employment and
collective/cooperative systems across large parts of the agricultural sector.
In addition, an underground (legal and illegal) economy exhibited self-
employed individuals, small capitalists, and small worker co-ops.
Regulating this economy was a powerful state that included a central
planning apparatus and also an intrusive Communist Party apparatus. As an
engine of rapid economic development with emphasis on industry, Soviet
state capitalism was remarkably successful. The USSR's growth took it
from being one of Europe's poorest regions devastated by war in 1917 to
being the world's number-two superpower by the 1960s. Moreover, that
achievement occurred despite massive destruction in the USSR from both
World Wars, revolution, civil war, foreign invasions, and a violent
agricultural collectivization. The prices paid for such growth included an
underdeveloped agriculture; limited real-wage gains; many unmet consumer
needs; and
continued constraints on civil liberties, political freedoms, etc., under
Stalin's nearly 30 years of dictatorial leadership. The generation and
reinvestment of huge surpluses enabled Soviet industrialization. Some of
those surpluses were realized within the industrial sector. Some came from
keeping wages low while continuously boosting worker productivity. And
some came from unequal exchanges between industry and agriculture by
means of planners keeping administered prices of agricultural staples
(chiefly grains) low relative to the industrial products farmers bought
(tractors, implements, fertilizers, etc.). These planning and industrial
management decisions shaped the costs incurred for the industrial growth
achieved. Lenin's hope that a socialist government plus state capitalism

would enable and suffice for a further transition from state capitalism to
socialism proved premature. A decade after the revolution, it was clear that
much more had to be done to lift Soviet industry to the point where an
adequate economy could support an adequate military so both could survive
surrounded by a hostile capitalist world. To that end, Soviet workers would
need to continue to work for low real wages, and agriculture would
continue to be squeezed — both to fund more industrialization. The difficult
forced march of Soviet development, pressured by time, continued. In that
situation, Stalin and his advisers made a fateful decision that has shaped
socialism's global history since. Breaking decisively with Lenin, Stalin
declared socialism to have been achieved in the USSR. No further
references to state capitalism in the USSR would be tolerated. Socialism
was no
longer the goal of a transitional period that would, in turn, give way to a
transition to communism. Instead socialism was the here and now.
Socialism was the USSR and vice versa. Communism was effectively
banished to so distant a future as to be irrelevant here and now. It thus
became easier for socialism's critics and enemies to attack socialism. One
could quote Stalin to equate socialism with the USSRs ongoing problems:
constrained real wages, squeezed agriculture, absent civil liberties and
political freedoms. Before, those lamentable conditions had characterized a
transitional period before socialism was achieved. But after Stalin's decision
to "declare" socialism achieved, those conditions became definitions of
socialism. Critics made a habit of repeating the equation endlessly. The
strategy of socialism's enemies became simple and obvious: First use
military threats, economic sanctions, covert interventions, and political
isolation to worsen the conditions of a nation run by socialists, and then
identify those conditions with socialism. After 1945, the Cold War, with its
arms race and global confrontations, took a huge toll on the USSR. Before
then it might have hoped to free up some of its surplus for investment to
provide increased private consumption for workers through higher real
wages and to fund better collective, subsidized consumption. The wartime
alliance with the US, UK, and France against Nazi Germany likely
encouraged such hopes. But after the alliance came the Cold War, and
Soviet leaders instead invested still more in very expensive armaments

(including nuclear), in costly military campaigns (Afghanistan), and foreign
support projects (Cuba).
After 1945, Western, primarily US, mass media (especially television and
cinema) spread and expanded their reach into the USSR. After the 1960s,
their reach further increased and brought abundant evidence of levels of
mass consumption much higher in the West than in the USSR, and higher
also than what Soviet mass media had led Soviet citizens to expect about
Western mass consumption. Food, clothing, apartments, cars, and
furnishings shown widely available to working people in the West
stimulated pent-up demand in the USSR. That plus later-reduced US-USSR
tensions stimulated the repressed demands of Soviet workers and citizens
for more consumer goods, civil liberties, and freedoms. But the pressures
on the Soviet surplus to fund further industrialization, plus the direct and
indirect costs of the Cold War at the same time, precluded meeting those
demands. Soviet workers reacted by shifting their focus from state and
collective workplaces to their private plots and under-the- table economic
activities. That depressed workers' productivity in state and collective
workplaces, depressing their incomes there and further shifting attention to
private plots, etc. This vicious cycle provoked the Communist Party to try
to suppress workers and deny their betrayal and disappointment. Opposition
to the limits on consumption, civil liberties, and freedoms built toward an
explosion that burst into the open in 1989. In Marxist economic theory, one
approach to explaining economic history compares the supply of surplus
(what remains from output after wages are paid and used-up means of
production are replaced) and a society's demands on that surplus. In other
words, will the surplus suffice to increase workers' consumption, expand
industrial and agricultural
capacities (i.e., accumulate capital, fund research and development, etc.),
serve the military's needs, allow for exports to pay for imports, and so on?
If the society's demands for surplus distributions exceed their supply,
difficult social decisions must be made. Whatever those decisions are,
portions of the population will emerge unsatisfied. Depending on the
conditions and context, unsatisfied people may turn in anger against the
system. Whether they do so depends in part on how they view the system in
place and how it compares to alternative systems. Stalin's decision to

describe the USSR as "socialism achieved" was never definitively
renounced or rejected subsequently, even when Stalin's dictatorship was. So
as the gap between supply and demands on surplus in Soviet state
capitalism built toward explosion, popular dissatisfaction grew. Sometimes
Soviet dissidents targeted individual leaders, such as Leonid Brezhnev,
sometimes artistic censorship and insufficient civil liberties. As repression
or uninterest by government worsened, popular anger shifted toward
bureaucratic corruption, then Communist Party failures, and eventually the
socialist system itself. Because successive Soviet regimes had blocked the
educational system, mass media, and political debates from admitting and
discussing alternative concepts of socialism and socialist economic systems,
most Soviet people believed there were but two alternative systems.
Socialism was what they knew in the USSR. In contrast, capitalism had
been the object of endless criticism. However, after the 1960s, with mass
media, freer travel, and detente (i.e., reduced tensions between the US and
USSR), people in the USSR came to
understand that workers in many capitalist countries enjoyed far greater
standards of living than the USSR, as well as greater civil liberties and
freedoms. Increasing numbers of Soviet people began to think critically
about their system (which they knew as "socialism") and to favor a
transition to the one "other" system that seemed possible: capitalism as in
the US or Western Europe. As the system they had became unbearable, so
they went toward the only other system they recognized. We can see
something similar happening in the United States, but in the opposite
direction. Since 2008's economic crash, increasing numbers of young
Americans have ever-more- limited economic options and unsustainable
college debts; plus they find the political system completely out-of-touch,
serving only the elites. Endless celebration of the status quo has taught them
that the broken system is capitalism. So they, like their Soviet counterparts
of the 1980s, reject the system they have and know for the only "other" they
have heard about, namely socialism. Not the least irony of Soviet history
flows from the fact that successive leaderships shut down debate among
alternative concepts, definitions, and visions of socialism in favor of one
official version. Thus, when a crisis of their system arose in 1989, most
Soviet citizens did not think they had multiple choices about alternative
systems. So Russia "returned" to private capitalism, undoing the 72 years of

the Soviet state capitalism that had been officially designated as "socialism"
since Stalin.
In that return to date, a mostly state capitalism reverted to a mostly private
capitalism. Their common employer/employee structures remained largely
intact. The who of the employer class went back to private individuals from
state officials. A strong central state apparatus regulated that private
capitalism. The long isolation of the USSR before and after World War II
reinforced an unbalanced economy. Gas and oil were increasingly important
exports, while food and manufactured consumer goods often became
important imports. Post-1989 Russia has been much less the world's second
superpower than it had been as the USSR. For a world that had largely
equated socialism with the USSR for decades, the 1989 implosion of the
USSR and its Eastern European allies seemed to mark the "end" of
socialism. A kind of capitalist triumphalism coupled itself to a debt-driven
neoliberal surge of capitalism in declaring socialism (and communism as
well) dead and buried. Of course, dissenting socialists of various sorts
argued that the demise of the USSR was, at most, the end of one
interpretation of socialism (and some argued it never was socialism). But
such arguments were all but drowned out by capitalists' self-congratulatory
triumphalism. Then the 2008 global capitalist crash changed all that. The
demise of the USSR also shook all socialists; it still does. The world's first
national, long-lasting experiment in constructing a socialist economy and
society collapsed. Its achievements and failures have to be examined to
improve socialism's future and especially to enable a more effective
socialist intervention when capitalism's contradictions create
new opportunities. China's communists have been drawing and applying
lessons from the rise and fall of the USSR since the latter's beginning.
Indeed, lessons have likewise to be drawn from the rise and fall of the
USSR to enable socialists to evaluate that other major new experiment in
constructing a socialist society: China. The Peoples Republic of China
(PRC) Alliances between the USSR and the eventual Communist Party
leaders of the PRC reach back into the 1920s, continued until 1960, rose
and fell thereafter, and have recently resumed. There have been strong
similarities and solidarities but also deep differences. China entered the
20th century extremely poor, with extreme economic, political, and cultural

inequality. While China had resisted Western colonialism sufficiently to
remain united, it had suffered deeply humiliating demands, including the
establishment of certain Western colonial enclaves (such as Hong Kong) on
China's territory. Colonialism's military superiority enforced those
demands. The humiliation was and remains informed by a long history that
included centuries of a far more advanced Chinese civilization than had
then been achieved in Europe. A deep sense of having been overtaken and
surpassed by others settled into China's self-consciousness. That continues
to fuel a drive for China in turn to overtake and surpass. In a profound
sense, socialism (China's version of Soviet-style state capitalism) is seen in
China as the proven way to do that.
At the very beginning of the 20th century, the Boxer Rebellion and then the
formation of the new republic, with Sun Yat-sen as president, inaugurated a
key break from China's past. Feudalisms of various sorts and individual
(family) peasant self-employment had been the dominant organizations of
workplaces. But a transition to capitalist organizations
(employers/employees) was underway. It was increasingly encouraged as a
way to catch up with the West and so enable that mix of anti-colonialism
and modernization that Chinese leaders (ideological as well as political)
championed. As elsewhere, early capitalism produced extreme exploitation
on the job and extremely poor living conditions off the job. For just that
reason, an early influence of the then-new USSR was to encourage and
support anti-capitalist organization among China's new industrial
proletariat. Small early victories led to large defeats for these organizations.
Their leaders, especially Mao Zedong, took followers into a kind of distant,
internal rural exile to escape slaughter by a military then closely allied to
the emerging Chinese capitalism. There, they solidified their organization,
undertook an intensive self-education in socialism and especially its
Marxian formulations, and studied the history of the USSR. On the basis of
those activities they reorganized the local peasant economy in ways that
celebrated peasants' collective self-management of farming. They also
organized a peasant army. When Japan invaded China and took over
Manchuria in 1931, Chinese society mobilized in self-defense. In the war
that lasted basically until 1945, the civil conflict between the dominant
capitalist forces (around General Chiang Kai-shek)

and the Communist Party resistance (around Mao Zedong and his Eighth
Route Army) was suspended. A combined counteroffensive against the
Japanese ended with victory and Japanese expulsion in 1945. Immediately a
civil war erupted. It ended in 1949 with the complete victory of the Chinese
Communist Party. The capitalist forces and army went into exile on the
small offshore island of Taiwan. It broke away from the Chinese mainland
and is now effectively an independent country with a capitalist economic
system. With its victory in 1949, China's Communist Party leadership faced
much the same set of questions as those confronting Lenin in the USSR in
- How exactly is the inherited capitalist system to be transformed?
What steps are to be taken and in what order, given the goal but also given
the obstacles? What parts of the Soviet experience should be replicated and
what parts avoided? Like the USSR, China nationalized capitalist industry,
establishing the state as employer and hiring employees to work. Like the
USSR, China prioritized industry. China was, with a notable exception,
wary of the Soviet experience in agriculture and so more careful in how it
responded to peasants' deeply ingrained land hunger. An attempt to rapidly
transform agriculture and industrialize (rural commune formation in the
1950s and the Great Leap Forward from 1958-1962) included serious
reverses in China's development and major losses and suffering from
famine. Consequent policy shifts slowed China's efforts to collectivize, put
greater reliance on village government and solidarity to group farmers, led
to more balanced investments in industry and agriculture, and so on. China
thereby suffered less trauma
flowing from its agricultural collectivization efforts than plagued Soviet
development after 1929/30. Like the USSR, China after 1949 confronted
political and military dangers from abroad. The Korean War (1950-1953)
demonstrated the risks in, for example, the massive bombing of North
Korea (mostly by US planes). The Chinese also confronted the fact of the
US dropping nuclear bombs on Japan earlier. The result was that Chinese
economic development required the use of a major part of its surplus to
support a large military apparatus. The early years after 1949 also saw the
US refusing to recognize the communist government in Beijing and
periodically threatening increased military support for Taiwan's ongoing
threat to "retake" the mainland. The 1960s were years of separation from
the USSR as China began to diverge from the Soviet strategy, partly

because of its assessment of that strategy. Reduced reliance on the USSR
forced a new direction in China's engagement with the rest of the world,
especially economically. The formal establishment of US-China diplomatic
relations in 1979 marks a further transition from the initial construction of a
modern Chinese economy and society to a second stage of rapid economic
growth since then. By 1979 China had established its growing importance
in the world, its political and ideological independence from the USSR, and
its willingness to engage with private capitalism both abroad and inside
China. In broad brush strokes, China's strategy offered an opening for both
foreign and domestic private capitalism to find secure places for profitable
business inside socialist China. Chinese
authorities proposed a kind of basic deal. Private capitalists (foreign,
domestic, or partnerships between them) would provide access to capital,
modern technology, and foreign markets. Chinese authorities would provide
access to skilled, disciplined, and relatively low-cost workers and access to
a very large and fast-growing domestic Chinese consumer market. Private
enterprises could generate profits that would be shared between them and
the Chinese state's taxation system. The Chinese state would closely
monitor and supervise all activities by such foreign and domestic
enterprises. Their owners and top executives, if Chinese, could also become
members of the Chinese Communist Party. Finally, the Chinese state would
retain a sizable sector of state-owned and -operated enterprises, and would
encourage multilevel partnerships and other relationships among them and
private capitalist enterprises, foreign and domestic. The Chinese state made
clear that maximum economic growth focused on industrialization was the
overriding objective of its strategy. In that, it was like the USSR. But in its
eager embrace of a supervised position for private foreign and domestic
capitalism inside Chinese industry, it was very unlike the USSR. The
Chinese strategy would have been politically untenable for the USSR for
most of its history — perhaps a consequence of being the first socialist
experiment to endure. And the Soviet leadership perhaps believed that a
more self-contained economic drive to industrialize was a safer route to
take. Given recent claims, a further point is necessary concerning this deal
that the PRC offered private capitalists around the world and in China. It
was very much a deal meant to be

mutually attractive to both sides. Neither side could have coerced the other
because neither side had the means to do so. It had to be voluntary and for
mutual benefit. Private capitalists invested their capital, shared their
technology, and provided access to their customer base to their Chinese
partners (private capitalists and/or Chinese state-owned enterprises). They
did so because it profited them. For that reason, foreign private capitalism's
position in the Chinese economy grew quickly over recent decades. China
provided access to its labor force and markets in exchange, an exchange
that grew because it benefited both sides. The Chinese government reported
average annual growth rates for its GDP of 10 percent from 1978 to 2005.
For the years since then, the widely respected, independent economic
consultancy, McKinsey and Company, estimates the growth of China's GDP
at annual rates around 10-15 percent from 2005-2010 and then slowly
declining to around 6 percent per year in 2019. The International Labour
Office similarly reports that average real wages in China rose over 8 percent
annually for the decade prior to 2018. Going back further and assembling
data from various sources suggests that average Chinese workers' real
wages have doubled or tripled at least since 1990. Together with a vast
range of statistics, these numbers show that the PRC has been the fastest-
growing economy in the world for some decades now. That explains its
becoming the number-two economic power in the world after the US and its
closing that gap with the US. In the 20th century, the USSR was the fastest-
growing economy; in the 21st century to date the PRC has played that role.
Their two kinds of socialism, as they called their economic
systems, were alike in achieving extraordinary rates of economic growth
and rising real wage/consumption levels. Both countries' governments
controlled their banking systems and thus provided ready credits to
lubricate their development projects and achieve their growth goals. China
rejected Soviet-type autarchy (adopted by the USSR in the context of global
hostility after 1917) in favor of a determined openness to foreign trade and
investment. In effect, China planned to industrialize via state and private
capitalisms focused on exports. Its low-wage workers would offer profit
opportunities to capitalist competitors around the world. China's powerful
government would organize and guarantee a basic deal with global
capitalists: China will provide cheap labor, government support, and a
growing Chinese market in exchange for foreign capitalists partnering with

Chinese state or private capitalists, providing their partners with access to
technology, and helping Chinese output to enter the wholesale and retail
trade systems around the world. Like the USSR, the People's Republic of
China mixed state and private capitalism to achieve rapid economic
development. To varying degrees, in both countries, the price paid included
deferred consumption, limited civil liberties and freedoms, and no
democratic transformation of workplaces. The broader notion of socialism
— a system that went beyond economics to include politics and culture —
was given a back seat. While both countries experienced rapid economic
growth, both also experienced underdeveloped consumption, civil liberties,
and personal freedoms.
Anti-socialist argumentation everywhere minimized or simply ignored
socialism's rapid economic growth and maximized its relatively low
consumption levels, civil liberties, and personal freedoms. Critics'
arguments defined socialism as what was actually a state capitalism (state-
owned and -operated workplaces replicating private workplaces'
employer/employee structure). They depicted socialism as a state/party
dictatorship presiding over a failed economy (proven by far lower levels of
consumption than in private capitalist economies). Socialism was identified
as state and party regimentation of its peoples' political and cultural lives.
This message was endlessly pumped into the US landscapes of academia,
the mass media, and politics over the last 70 years. Anti-socialists ascribe
the 1989 implosion of the USSR to its failed economy, to complete the
lessons they draw from the major socialist experiment of the 20th century.
However, somehow the fact is ignored that as capitalism emerged from
feudalism in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, its advocates promised
liberty, equality, fraternity, and democracy. When those promises failed to
materialize, the disappointment and anger provoked many to become anti-
capitalist and find their way to socialism in the 19th and 20th centuries.
That anti-capitalists and then anti-socialists found their ways to parallel
criticisms of failures in the systems they opposed raises the possibility that
those systems had more in common than their 19th-and 20th-century
conflicts saw or admitted. In contrast, those socialists that engaged in
reflective self-criticism before and after 1989 produced a quite different
narrative that grounded itself on that commonality and in the

failures of both systems. For them, the US and USSR both represented
private and state capitalisms whose Cold War enmity was misconstrued on
both sides as part of the century's great struggle between capitalism and
socialism. In these socialists' view, what collapsed in 1989 was Soviet and
Eastern European state capitalism, not socialism. Moreover, what soared
after 1989 was another state capitalism in China. Inside and outside both the
USSR and China, many socialists felt that both countries had somehow
gotten off track. They had produced societies that were socialist in the old
sense of state-owned and -operated workplaces and state planning, but
lacked key parts of what socialists had always defined as their goals
(equality, solidarity, democracy, and so on). After the 1989 Soviet
implosion, a vast process of rethinking and socialist self-criticism set in. It
generated a new definition of socialism that pointedly prioritized the micro-
level of how workplaces are organized. Socialism is about democratizing
workplaces, making them worker cooperatives rather than hierarchical
places where small minorities of employers dominate and exclude from
major decisions an employee majority. That new definition informs much of
this book, including this chapter's discussion of what happened in the USSR
and China. That new definition also generates new goals and a
corresponding new strategy for 21st-century socialism. If this new
definition strikes readers as unexpected, that is because the anti-socialism
campaigns over the last 75 years led many to disconnect from the topic of
socialism altogether. Its self-criticism, debates, and changes were, and
remain, largely
unknown. New socialisms have emerged with newly defined goals and
strategies for achieving them. However, before offering one set of those
goals and strategies, we need to explain two other relevant aspects of
socialism's modern history (the last century). The first is the "great purge"
of socialism led by forces in the United States after World War II and
extending, to varying degrees, across the world. The second is fascism,
especially in its German Nazi form, a particular kind of state-capitalism
merger (that called itself a kind of socialism). Fascists aimed to exterminate
the socialist movement and democracy itself from Germany but also from
the rest of the world. The mid-20th century's efforts first to exterminate and
then to purge socialists had profound social effects that include socialism's
changes and current resurgence.

## Chapter V
Two Anti-socialist Purges: Fascism and Anti-communism
The 20th century witnessed many repressive attacks on socialism and
socialists. They were powerful testimony that socialism — as a critique and
alternative to capitalism — was spreading fast and far. Two major anti-
socialist purges were accomplished by its enemies. The first was European
fascism in the century's first half. The second was US-led global "anti-
communism" in the second half. Socialism's various interpretations and
changes were profoundly affected by these purgps and their social
consequences. "Fascism" is a term that has been applied to many places and
times in the social life and history of the 20th century. Here we use it as the
name for an economic system, namely capitalism, but with a mixture of
very heavy government influence. In fascism, the government reinforces,
supports,
and sustains private capitalist workplaces — usually because private
capitalists fear otherwise losing them, especially during times of social
upheaval. Under fascism, there is a kind of mutually supportive merging of
government and private workplaces. Fascist governments tend to
"deregulate" worker protections won earlier by unions or socialist
governments. They help private capitalists by destroying trade unions or
replacing them with their own organizations which support, rather than
challenge, private capitalists. Frequently, fascism embraces extreme
nationalism and patriotism to rally people to fascist economic objectives,
often by using enhanced military expenditures and hostility toward
immigrants or foreigners generally. Fascist governments influence foreign
trade to help domestic capitalists sell their goods abroad, and block imports,
through tariffs, to help them sell their goods inside national boundaries.
Usually, fascists abhor socialism and promise to save capitalism and the
nation from domestic and foreign socialists and communists, treated as
threats. In Europe's major fascist systems — Spain under Franco, Germany
under Hitler, and Italy under Mussolini — socialists and communists were
arrested, imprisoned, and often tortured and killed. A superficial similarity
between fascism and socialism arises because both seek to strengthen

government and its interventions into the economy and society. However,
they do so in different ways and toward very different ends. Fascism seeks
to use the government to secure capitalism and revert
to a national unity, defined often in terms of ethnic or religious purity and
hierarchy. Socialism seeks to use the government to end capitalism and
substitute an alternative socialist economic system, defined traditionally in
terms of state-owned and -operated workplaces, state economic planning,
employment of dispossessed capitalists, workers' political control, and
internationalism. When fascist leaders took power in Germany in 1933, they
had already fought many battles — both in the political arena and in the
streets—with socialists in both the German Socialist and Communist
parties. Many leading capitalists across the German economy, and many
centrist and conservative German politicians, were frightened by the steady
growth of the German Socialist Party (SPD) since the 1870s, and by the
growth of the German Communist Party (KPD) after World War I. No one
in Germany had any doubts about the extreme right-wing nature and agenda
of the Nazi Party and its leader, Adolf Hitler. In the infancy of his Nazi
party, Hitler's early decision to adopt the words "socialist" and "workers"
into its name (National Socialist German Workers' Party) aimed to draw
away some German working-class voters who had overwhelmingly
supported the SPD and KPD. In that aim, the Nazis had limited success
before 1933, but were then able to draw more support from small-business
owners, farmers, unemployed professionals, and religious conservatives.
The Nazis had outmaneuvered the traditional, old conservative German
parties (discredited by their loss in World War I), to attract many voters and
militants.
When the 1929 capitalist crash hit Germany, it was still reeling from its loss
in the war. Since 1918, capitalism, and the traditional center-right and right-
wing parties supporting it, all suffered rising criticism and popular disdain.
German industry saw the political handwriting on the wall. The widespread
discontent with the system in power portended the victory of socialists,
either those in the SPD, the KPD or both. By 1932, German capitalists saw
the Nazis as the only rising mass-based party that could possibly provide
broad political support and stem the rising red tide. So the leading German
industrial capitalist association leaned on President von Hindenburg to

invite Hitler to form the next German government early in 1933. One of the
desired outcomes that this alliance of prominent German capitalists and the
Nazis shared was to block, thwart, reduce, and defeat socialism in general,
and the SPD and KPD in particular. In the early years of Nazi power,
although capitalists supported debilitating the socialist and communist
popular movements, in general they did not imagine, let alone understand,
that the Nazis could and would exterminate socialists, communists, and
many others — physically, and by the millions. German Nazis were not
alone in their persecution of socialists and communists. Europe's other
major fascist regimes were also murderous towards socialists, communists,
and many of those sympathetic with them. In Spain, Francisco Franco
waged a bitter, deadly civil war against the country's elected socialist
government and its supporters. Benito Mussolini imposed fascism on Italy
for many years, imprisoning and eventually killing the 20th century's
greatest Italian socialist leader and theoretician, Antonio Gramsci, as well
as many
other socialist activists. In Japan, fascists rose to power via the 1931
"Manchurian Incident" to justify their invasion of Manchuria and the 1932
assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, which paved the way for
Emperor Hirohito's military dictatorship. The savage destruction of Chinese
lives and property by Japanese fascism is as well known as its parallels in
European fascism's destruction in Europe. Nazism in Germany was a fascist
economic system in which the government lent its support and its force to
secure a capitalism that had already been deeply compromised by its pre-
World War I alliance with the German kaiser and the German nobility. In
this alliance, German capitalists had compromised with feudalism, even as
they replaced that system. During the German Empire (1871 - 1918),
German capitalists and nobles promoted aggressive competition with
British and then US capitalists, and they allied to form an effective bloc
against the tide of German socialism that had been rising since the 1870s.
However, that capitalist-feudal alliance (typified by Bismarck and von
Hindenburg) was blamed for losing the first world war, for the suffering
caused by the war, and then for mismanaging the economic cost of post-war
reparations that resulted in the catastrophic 1923 German inflation that
wiped out the savings of Germany's middle classes. When the 1929 crash
hit, German capitalism tottered. Half the country supported socialists and

communists. The other half was split and decreasingly friendly to
capitalism. Even fascists called themselves "national socialists" to signal
that their right-wing nationalism included a solid dose of anti-capitalism.
German capitalists grasped their social vulnerability. They knew all too
well what had happened to Russian capitalists only a few years earlier. In
1932 German Nazism and German capitalism reached an accommodation.
Each acquired crucial assistance, and each paid a price for it. The Nazis
acquired governmental power via Hitler's ascendancy to his position as the
supreme German leader, or der Fuhrer. With that power, Nazism acquired
the means to increase and strengthen itself while destroying or
subordinating all other political parties. Nazis in power thereby also
acquired the means to rearm Germany to avenge the loss of the World War
and the subsequent humiliations. The price the Nazis paid was losing inside
the Nazi movement through extermination, its explicitly anti-capitalist
elements and sympathisers, including Gregor and Otto Strasser, among
many others. The capitalists achieved a mass political base that officially
supported and celebrated capitalism and the leading German capitalists
(excluding Jews). The capitalists also achieved a government that would
oppose and crush all socialist, or even independent, organizations of the
working class (unions, social movements, etc.) or convert them into loyal
supporters of German fascism. The price capitalists had to pay for Nazi
supports was basically a merger or combination between capitalism and
Nazism. German fascism assigned to major German capitalists a kind of
ongoing, close association with Nazism's top leadership. Capitalists'
economic decisions were closely coordinated with Nazi leaders' political
decisions. In many cases, where differences arose, the latter prevailed.
While there were always some capitalists who rejected or refused to accept
the merger, the vast majority did neither.
They accepted the price of the merger and subordination to the Nazi party
and government because it was the best, or perhaps even the only, option to
preserve German capitalism. The Nazi government destroyed socialist and
independent labor unions and subordinated them instead to the control of
German state and Nazi Party officials. The Nazi government destroyed
socialist parties and persecuted socialist academics, artists, intellectuals, and
activists. Thousands were deported, imprisoned, exiled, killed, or compelled

to flee, and Nazi leaders boasted to their capitalist partners that they had
eliminated socialism from German life. The fascist merger of state officials
and leading capitalists enabled Germany to escape from reparations-related
restrictions imposed after World War I's defeat. Fascism built a German
economic recovery after the 1929-1932 crash by reducing unemployment
via rapid rearmament. It redesigned European trade patterns to advance
German interests. Finally, it undertook systematic planning for the
expansion of Germany to form a new German empire. Germany's turn to
fascism raised yet again the broad question of state versus private
capitalism. During the 19th and 20th centuries, state versus private
capitalism was often debated as the core issue of the overall debate between
capitalism and socialism. The political, economic, and social goals of state
capitalism were radically different for socialists on the left versus fascists
on the right. But many discussions focused solely on state capitalism's
existence and differences from private capitalism, and lost sight of different
state capitalisms' profoundly different goals and purposes.
This is part of a larger issue of confusing state capitalism with socialism.
When state capitalism happened, capitalism was instead said to have given
way to socialism. When private capitalism was threatened by government
encroachments via regulations, taxations, or nationalized workplaces, it was
said that socialism was threatening or overtaking capitalism. When states
privatized state-owned and -operated workplaces or deregulated them or cut
their tax obligations, it was often done by "conservative" politicians. They
said they were reviving or returning to capitalism and getting rid of
socialism or socialist elements in their societies. Similar confusing
transitions occurred during the declining phases of the slave and feudal
economic systems: from relatively decentered, private forms to
concentrated, centralized state forms. Deepening problems of maintaining
slave economies (i.e., economies where production was organized around
masters and slaves) provoked private masters eventually to solve those
problems by making or permitting a state apparatus that was itself a master
with slaves. In short, a coexisting and specifically empowered state slavery
proved to be one way to sustain private slavery. Much the same evolution
happened as private feudal manors produced the absolute feudal states
during late European feudalism. The coexistence of state and private
slavery or of state and private feudalism was rarely achieved peacefully.

Disagreements among private slave masters over establishing that
coexistence, and anxieties among and between private and state slave
masters over managing that coexistence,
could and did lead to conflicts. These included violent clashes. Again, a
similar history attended European feudalism. However, the coexistence of
their private and state forms does not warrant thinking that those systems
were not slave or feudal, and so it is the same with the confusion of state
capitalism and socialism. The Nazis were not socialists (even with the word
"socialist" in their name), and the heavy hand of the Nazi party created a
fascist state capitalism, not socialism. In contrast, modern capitalism has
debated to exhaustion whether state forms of its employer/employee
structure mean capitalism is threatened, dying, or passing over into a
different economic system — socialism. The coexistence of state and
private forms of capitalism are rather like parallel coexistences in slavery
and feudalism. Indeed, the relatively faster growth of state-capitalist forms
may parallel slavery and feudalism in yet another way. Those systems
secured their reproduction in part by means of transitioning from
decentralized, minimal state institutions to powerfully centralized state
institutions embodying state forms of master/slave and lord/serf production
structures. Perhaps the last century entails capitalism entering a similar
transition from decentralized private to centralized state forms, but with this
peculiarity: The transition was misperceived as a change of system itself
rather than a change between forms of the same system. Nazis understood
themselves as the means to save German capitalism, as part of the German
nation, from its leftist critics (lumped together under the term
"bolshevism"). The close, ongoing collaborations between the Nazi state
and leading
German capitalists exceeded anything that had happened in the history of
German capitalism before that. There were striking similarities between
German fascism and the previous close alliance of the Prussian state with
leading feudal lords in the regions that later became modern Germany. The
Nazis repressed socialists systematically after January 1933, including
eventually their wholesale murder, imprisonment, drafting into the German
military, and deportation. Those who survived and remained went
underground. Elsewhere across Europe, where Nazi Germany ruled, the

repression of socialism was likewise harsh. This was also the case among
Nazi Germany's allies in Italy, Spain, and beyond. In Spain, for example,
Franco's fascism decimated the ranks of young socialists for decades, not
only in Spain but also in the many countries that sent brilliant young
volunteers to fight in the 1930s Spanish Civil War. Young people growing
up inside fascism learned a lasting lesson in the immense risks taken by
individuals drawn to socialist theory and practice. At the same time, a
socialist underground developed both ideologically and organizationally.
Underground socialist solidarity proved a strong basis for European
socialism's revival after 1945. The impact of fascism on socialism took
multiple forms. One that is particularly important concerns fascism's impact
on the relative strengths of different interpretations or different tendencies
or traditions within socialism. After 1917, the success of the socialist
revolutionaries in Russia gave their interpretation of socialism the prestige
of having achieved the first enduring governmental position for socialists.
In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet socialism had to contend with
criticisms from other socialists. Communists debated and contended with
socialists. Other socialists contested the prestige and relative strength of the
international communist tradition. Fascism renewed the exceptional
prestige and strength of Soviet socialism. This happened for two main
reasons. First, local communists were connected via the Communist
International, or Comintern. This was an international organization of
communists who collaborated with one another to share lessons learned,
coordinate strategies, etc. The USSR was its effective leader. Since the
USSR was the Nazis' main target and enemy, Nazi occupations targeted
local communists more harshly than other socialists. Communists went
underground sooner and developed better underground linkages. For these
and other reasons, communists rose to leadership positions in many
underground resistance movements against fascism across Europe.
Experiences there strengthened their solidarity, prestige, and support
relative to other socialists, and their ability to advance politically after
fascism was defeated. Second, the USSR prevented the Nazi invasion from
overthrowing Soviet socialism and then drove fascist forces from their
territory and across Eastern Europe all the way to Berlin. That reinforced
the prestige and power of the Soviet brand of socialism once again. In this
remarkable way, fascism worked ultimately to strengthen Soviet socialism

despite the massive physical damage done to the Soviet people and
economy by fascist military forces.
Already toward the end of World War II, the USSR and the US anticipated,
and were planning for, their likely split and transformation from victorious
allies into rivals. As it happened, they quickly went beyond rivalry to an
enmity of Cold War proportions. The much greater wealth of the US, its
atomic bomb and global military reach, and fear of how the Soviet
government might use its enhanced post-war political strength gave the US
a dominant position in the world after 1945. The US used that position to
design and unleash a global program of systematic anti-communism
targeting the USSR and the influence of communists linked to it. (The
Truman Doctrine was a policy epitomizing the "containment" of
communism.) The 20th century's second major purge of socialism thus got
underway and has continued at varying levels of intensity ever since. It
represented the replacement of fascism's purging of socialism led by
Germany with what might be called a centrist purge led by the US.
Capitalism's global crash in 1929 led to greater interest in socialism in both
countries, which in turn also led to reactions against a rising socialism:
German-led fascism in one instance, US-led anti-communism in another.
The reaction to the 1930s Great Depression in the US differed from that in
Germany. While both sets of working classes developed strong anti-
capitalist views and many moved toward socialism, fascist reactions in the
US were much weaker and much less well organized than in Germany.
Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) proved a very different leader from Hitler. An
alliance of parts of the US's Democratic Party, Communist Party, two
socialist parties, and a surging labor movement (Congress of Industrial
Organizations, or CIO)
comprised the New Deal coalition. It was the mass base for FDR's
progressive laws, multiple reelections, and resolute anti-fascism. US
socialists obtained from FDR's government a degree of social acceptance,
stature, and support never before accorded them. The wartime alliance of
the US with the USSR strengthened that social acceptance and socialist
influences. One result of those influences was the government tax and
spending policies of the 1930s and 1940s. In short, FDR's government
taxed the rich more than ever before and used the money to provide mass

public services more than ever before. FDR established the Social Security
system, the first federal unemployment compensation system, the first
federal minimum wage, and a mass federal jobs program, among other
government-supported social programs. FDR raised the revenue necessary
for Washington to fund such public services in the depths of the 1930s
Depression. He likewise raised revenues to finance the US role in World
War II. He did so by taxing corporations and the rich. He also borrowed
from them. Nevertheless, FDR's attack on wealth and privilege to fund jobs
and services for the poor and middle income citizens did not destroy his
political position as critics and enemies had threatened. Quite the opposite.
FDR was reelected three times, and was arguably the most popular
president in US history. He was also the president most pushed politically
from below by a coalition of communists, socialists, and unionists. He had
been no radical Democrat before his election. Massive government
intervention to redistribute wealth, income, and government support from
corporations and the
rich to average citizens reflected the unprecedented political power of the
US left. That reality — and especially the power of the New Deal coalition
— drove a commitment among private capitalists and the Republican Party
to undo the New Deal. The end of World War II and FDR's death in 1945
provided the right time and circumstances to destroy the New Deal
coalition. The specific target for this project became a massive purging of
socialist influences. In this way, the coalition that had produced FDR's New
Deal could be broken. Anti-communism quickly became the battering ram
with which to do that. Overnight, the USSR went from close ally to demon
enemy, whose agents were everywhere in communist parties operating as
arms of an effort "to control the world." This threat had to be contained,
repelled, eliminated. In the US, Communist Party leaders were arrested,
imprisoned, and deported, in a wave of anti-communism that quickly spread
to socialist parties and to socialism in general. Sequentially, "communism,"
"socialism," "Marxism," "totalitarianism," and "anarchism" became de facto
synonyms — lumped together by the general concept of "anti-communism."
Any and all of these practices had to be driven back and out of the US and
the rest of the world as far as possible. Domestic and foreign policy of the
United States became centrally focused on anti-communism. Because the
US after 1945 had the world's largest economy and most powerful military,

it also wielded the dominant political-power position. Hence it held the
central position in crafting the United Nations, World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, NATO, and so on. Once the US committed
itself to total anti-
communism, its allies and most of the rest of the world followed suit more
or less as their domestic situations enabled or allowed. The Chinese
Revolution's success under Mao's leadership a few years after the end of
World War II provoked even more heightened anti-communism. It reached
hysterical dimensions culminating in the public campaigns of US Senator
Joseph McCarthy. "McCarthyism" became a general label attached to such
political hysterias. In the US, key moments and forms marked the
excoriation of communists (and usually likewise of many socialists,
especially if they had been open about their ideological commitments). In
1947, the Taft-Hartley Act prevented Communist Party members from
holding union leadership positions (whether or not union members had
voted them into those positions). Most US unions went further and removed
socialists from leadership positions, expelled or took over locals thought to
be controlled by socialists, and generally sent all union members a basic
memo: Keep away from socialism and socialists (regardless of their specific
labels, such as communist, anarchist, leftist, etc.). Hollywood actors,
directors, screenwriters, musicians, and more were blacklisted and barred
from working in the industry, effectively destroying the careers of hundreds
of working professionals, and thus ensuring American popular media would
be unsympathetic to socialism. The war in Korea was presented as
emblematic of the new international polarization. On one side was the
"West, " portrayed as capitalistic, free, democratic, and good. On the other
was the "East," the opposite place demonized as socialistic,
totalitarian, and bad. Educators — from elementary school teachers through
college and university professors — got fired, demoted, and/or otherwise
disciplined if they taught, spoke, or wrote otherwise. Suddenly many
professors with strong or weak sympathies for socialist critiques of
capitalism found that their work could no longer get published, that
colleagues stopped assigning their work as required reading for students,
that invitations to present their work at scholarly conferences dried up. The
teaching profession received the same message that had swept across the

unions, Hollywood, and the American public in general. The number-one
enemy of the US was now socialism, communism, and the Soviet "evil
empire." Around the world, US foreign policy likewise targeted socialism.
Sometimes the label was applied to persons, groups, organizations, and
movements that were self-defined as socialist. At other times, political
struggles abroad competed for US government support by branding their
enemies as socialists. Then too, profit-driven struggles among business
groups, or between them and government officials, led them to seek US
support by accusing their adversaries of being "socialist." Examples include
US policies and actions especially in Guatemala and Iran (1954), Cuba
## (1959-1961), Vietnam (1954-1975), South Africa (1945-1994), Venezuela
(since 1999), among many, many others. Anti-communism was likewise the
central theme and focus of US military policies in the post-1945 nuclear
age. The US established a ring of thousands of military bases surrounding
the USSR, then Soviet allies in Eastern Europe, then China, and so on. The
US contested political groupings in Asia, Africa, and Latin American
countries seen to be socialist. Inside allied
European countries, it helped repress socialist officials, groups, and parties
in favor of their opponents. The US government found or established allies
to assist its international anti-communism. Where US officials found anti-
communist organizations in a country, they helped establish, build, and/or
fund them. Where such organizations already existed but were weak, US
officials helped or supplemented them. These included church and
missionary groups, business associations, individual corporations, and labor
unions. The US foreign-policy establishment included the leadership of the
AFL-CIO. Academic associations and individual professors were recruited
and funded (overtly and covertly) by the US government or its allies to
produce research that would advance the anti-communist project.
Sometimes, regime change was the form taken by the global anti-
communism project when and where local conditions made that possible.
Early in the post-World War II period, Iran's Mossadegh fell victim, as did
Guatemala's Arbenz. In 1965-6 the mass killings of Indonesian communists
were estimated to cost the lives of 500,000 to three million. Shortly after the
1959 victory of Cuba's revolution, the new Castro government faced overt
opposition from the US, then an embargo and an armed effort to overthrow
that government directed and supported by the US. The overthrow effort

was defeated, but Cuba was thereafter isolated. Anti-communism was the
major theme and preoccupation of US policies in and for Latin America for
the subsequent decades. Many more examples exist, culminating in the
undercutting of the USSR and its Eastern European allied governments.
Each instance had its unique
characteristics. However, the presence and effectiveness of the US-led
global anti-communism project were always important contributors of a
particular context for each local struggle. Nearly everywhere, socialists,
communists, and their organizations were undermined, repressed, or
outright destroyed. The progress of socialism that had so frightened
capitalism's supporters before, during, and in the aftermath of fascism was
slowed by US-led global anti-communism. The demise of the USSR and
Eastern European socialist governments especially raised the triumphalist
idea that perhaps anti-communism had succeeded beyond its hopes. Perhaps
the 20th century's struggle between capitalism and socialism/communism
had been definitively decided in the former's favor. Amid a surging global
neoliberalism — as the post-1970s successor to the previously (1930s-
1970s) dominant Keynesianism — post-communism seemed assured.
However, the 2008 global crash reminded many millions that capitalism
was its own worst enemy. As hundreds of millions lost jobs, incomes,
homes, and savings, socialist criticisms of capitalism resurfaced and
captured new generations' loyalties. Once again, capitalism's tendencies
toward inequality, instability, and injustice became common knowledge.
The capitalist triumphalism that had soared since 1989 faded quickly. For
the first time in 70 years, a candidate for the US presidency could accept the
label "socialist" and do far, far better in getting votes than anyone had
foreseen. Thereafter, hundreds of US socialists are seeking political office,
and increasing numbers are winning.
Socialist criticisms of Soviet and Chinese socialisms and of European social
democracy reflected a growing range of debates within and about socialism.
The socialist tradition's pre-1917 diversity of interpretations and tendencies
— and lively debates around them — began to resurface. The populisms
provoked by rejections of neoliberalism and its old politics (oscillating
center-right and center-left parties) generated a new socialist left. Old
socialist parties shrank, disappeared, or changed leadership in the face of

new anti-capitalist parties and mass movements (such as Podemos in Spain,
Syriza in Greece, the "yellow vests" in France, Corbyn-type leadership in
the UK's Labour Party, and so on). Socialist anti-capitalism began to
reappear explicitly in the mass media, in school curricula, and in politics.
Traditional politicians increasingly attacked socialism where before they
had ignored its existence or treated it as some long-dead historic relic.
Environmental activists found ready allies in the rebounding socialism as
did a new generation of labor-union militants. Where before activists on
issues of race, gender, and other progressive movements had carefully
avoided economic issues in general and socialist approaches in particular,
after 2008 their coalitions with socialists became easier to negotiate and
manage. Thus in 2011 the "Occupy Wall Street" movement made its slogan
of the one percent versus the 99 percent a centerpiece of its global
movement. The welcome openness to a socialist trope was obvious. The
20th century's two great purges of socialism had failed to bury it or stop its
development. They had, however, slowed it and left deep traces. Two or
more generations had been traumatized: History had shown them that
socialist thoughts
and actions were extremely dangerous and costly on a personal level. Given
pro-capitalist ideologies' influences, many young people turned away from
political engagement. Individual effort, focus, and achievement took
precedence and absorbed energies. Workers' response to the exhaustion and
injustices of the workplace focused chiefly on consumption, as all
advertising urged. Buying was the appropriate and adequate compensation
for alienating labor. In the worker's day, the "happy hours" began
immediately after work in the bar and then later at the mall. Struggling to
improve work conditions (and therefore learning and mastering the
associated socialist theories and practices) fell out of fashion. They seemed
less attractive and less effective. Socialism was hurt, but also taught, by the
two great purges it suffered. Defeats and sharp criticisms sent many of its
best thinkers to return to fundamentals, to ask hard, critical questions, and
produce new tendencies within socialist thought. With active socialism
dangerously repressed, many socialists redirected their energies to other
social movements (anti-racism, feminism, ecology, and so on), giving them
a stronger socialist component. Likewise, that served to bring all sorts of
important insights and arguments developed in and by those social

movements into socialist consciousness, debates, and development.
Socialists rediscovered that it is never repression itself, but rather how a
repressed movement copes with repression, that determines its ultimate
effects. Socialism's history since 1945 has seen ups and downs, declines and
resurgences. Out of its evaluations of the two great experiments in the
USSR and the PRC, its responses to criticisms and repression, and the
endless provocations of capitalism and its failures, socialism has made
major changes
and emerged in the 21st century with renewed power and influence. The
two great purges of the 20th century did not settle the struggle between
capitalism and socialism. The 21st century's first two decades have shown
the struggle is very much alive and ongoing. As socialism changed
profoundly in the transition from the 19th to the 20th century, so it did again
a century later. Its shifting nature, composition, and trajectory give every
sign of shaping the 21st century too.

Chapter VI
Socialism's Future and Worker Co-ops
In this book's Introduction we referred to socialism as a yearning for
something better than capitalism. As capitalism has changed and as
experiments with socialism have accumulated — both good and bad —
socialist yearnings, too, have changed. However, a bizarre disconnect
surfaces as capitalism's gross dysfunction during and since its 2008 crash
brings socialism again into public discussion. Large numbers of people
debate the pros and cons of socialism as if what it is in the 21st century
were identical to what it was in the 20th. Is it reasonable to presume that the
last century's two purges, the Cold War, the implosion of the USSR, and the
explosive emergence of the People's Republic of China inspired no critical
reflections on socialism by socialists themselves? No. The remarkable lack
of awareness of new and different definitions of socialism since 1945, their
elaborations, and their implications reflects the fact that sustained
engagement with
socialism was taboo in the US for decades. That people are now mostly
unaware of socialism's evolution in theory, practice, and self-criticism over
the last half century is therefore no surprise. The taboo against socialism
resulted in a mass retreat from engaging with developments in socialism
and connecting these developments to the problems of modern capitalism.
Socialism rather became one of two things in the minds of most. On the one
hand, many politicians, academics, and media pundits portrayed socialism
as coinciding with Soviet efforts to subvert global capitalism. Socialism for
such people meant moving from private to state-owned and -operated
workplaces and from market to centrally planned distributions of resources
and products. These same people equated opposing capitalism with
opposing democracy and freedom. This equation was then repeated
endlessly in an effort to make it "common sense." On the other hand,
socialism was the name adopted by Western European — and especially
Scandinavian — "welfare-state" governments, which aimed to regulate
markets comprised still mostly of private capitalist firms. This led many
people to associate socialism with robust public spending and government

intervention in the marketplace. Consequently, socialism was viewed as
more or less extreme, depending on whether it involved state-owned and -
operated firms with central planning at one end or merely welfare-state
policies with market regulation on the other. The words
"communist" and "socialist" sometimes designated the more and less
extreme versions, respectively. As a result of these wooden definitions of
socialism, its evolution and diversity were obscured. Socialists themselves
were struggling with what they viewed as the mixed results of the first
major, enduring experiments in constructing socialist societies (USSR,
PRC, Cuba, Vietnam, etc.). To be sure, these socialist experiments achieved
remarkable and admirable economic growth. Such growth enabled mutual
assistance among socialist societies, which was crucial to their defense and
survival. Socialism thereby established itself globally as capitalism's chief
rival and likely successor. In the Global South, socialism arose virtually
everywhere as the alternative development model to a capitalism weighed
down by its colonialist history and its contemporary problems of inequality,
instability, and injustice. Yet socialists also struggled with some negative
aspects of these first experiments in socialism, particularly the emergence
of strong central governments that often used their concentrated economic
power to achieve political dominance in very undemocratic ways. Many
socialists agreed with critical denunciations of political dictatorship, even
though some of these criticisms ignored the parallel dictatorships within
capitalist megacorporations. Struggles of workers in socialist societies
against internal exploitation and oppression likewise affected socialists'
thinking. Some socialist theorists — for instance, Milovan Djilas and his
circle in the non-Soviet socialist republic of Yugoslavia — began to apply
class analysis to Soviet-type socialisms, and argued that party bureaucrats
were a new class. One implication of this line of
thought was that the USSR had not broken from class anywhere near as
thoroughly as it had proclaimed. Whatever the pronouncements of party
leaders and apologists, many socialists after 1945, and even more after
1989, grasped the unfinished, incomplete, and inadequate state of the
socialist projects of their day. Such socialist dissenters made various efforts
to "open the windows" of the musty atmosphere within official circles of
socialism after 1945. (These words came from an impassioned member of

the French Communist Party, Etienne Balibar, and echoed the critical
theoretical stance of his teacher, Louis Althusser.) Young socialists during
the globally widespread protests of 1968 asked new and different questions
of an older generation of socialists. Eurocommunism sought some kind of
compromise between the communist type of socialism in the Soviet bloc
and the social-democratic type in Western Europe. Strains of anarchist
thought and practice returned as possible ways to advance socialist ideals
without the fraught statism that had been associated with these ideals.
Maoist communes emerged as another possible way to advance these ideals,
as was the case with Yugoslav cooperatives and Israeli kibbutzim earlier.
Socialists over the last half century were also profoundly shaken by
criticisms from emerging social movements on the left. Anti-racists,
feminists, and environmentalists — many of whom had started in socialist
circles — began to criticize socialists for disregarding or minimizing the
primary foci of their struggles. Socialist feminism and eco-socialisms, for
example, sought to take these criticisms to heart. Likewise, socialists
everywhere began to rethink what a socialist position
ought to emphasize in order to integrate the demands and goals of social
movements with which it sought alliances. One strain of somewhat
superficial socialist self-criticism stressed socialism's inadequate
recognition and institutionalization of democracy. This self-criticism
acknowledged and accommodated socialism's critics, many of whom
asserted the absence of political democracy in socialist societies. Such
thinking also sharpened the struggle within socialism between communist
tendencies and social-democratic tendencies. The latter usually functioned
within parliamentary systems, where socialists — even when they held
elected power — had to govern democratically. These social democrats
advertised their democratic credentials against socialists from countries
where communist parties ruled. Thus, when Eastern European socialist
regimes dissolved after 1989, many socialists in these countries sought
transitions to Western European-type socialisms. In some cases — for
instance, in Hungary and Poland — their hopes were badly disappointed.
Socialists who called for political democracy to be added to the socialist
economic system confronted several questions and problems. First, how is
that to be done? Merely adding multiple political parties and elections was
surely not the answer. Socialists knew better than most how wealth, income,

and economic power tended to concentrate in capitalist corporate hands,
thereby rendering parties and elections formalities with little democratic
substance. Why should socialists think that parallel concentrations in state-
owned and -operated workplaces would yield a different outcome?
A larger problem for the project of merging socialism with democracy
concerned the question of where such a merger was to occur. Was
democracy to be located in relations between the state, individual
workplaces, and individual citizens; between different people inside
workplaces; or in both? Would workplaces be counted like individuals in
liberal democracies: one vote each, regardless of wealth, size, and so on?
Would democracy be institutionalized inside every workplace so that all
employees, with one vote each, could decide democratically what, how, and
where the workplace produces and what is done with output and revenues?
If so, how would such workplace democracy interact in a democratic
manner with those affected outside a given workplace — for instance,
customers or others in the surrounding communities? Capitalism never
faced, let alone solved, these problems, so figuring out how socialism might
do so proved difficult for the socialists who undertook the task. For many
socialists, such questions and problems proved too demanding. Such
socialists resorted to abstract invocations of democracy with little or no
attention to the specifics. Anti-socialists could continue to berate the
shrinking number of communist-party-led societies for their absence of
democratic forms (pretending, as usual, that the forms equaled the
substance of democracy). Meanwhile, avowed socialists, like Sanders in the
US or Corbyn in the UK, pointed to Western European-type socialisms as
proof of the merits of "democratic socialism." Increasingly after the 2008
crash of capitalism, however, many socialists grasped the deeper issue of
inadequate and incomplete democracy, both in conventional socialisms and
in capitalisms, whether private or state. To invoke transition from
communism to capitalism in the name of democracy — as was widely done
before and even more so after 1989 — was to demote democracy from
substance to formality. What struck growing numbers of socialists was that
the absence of real, substantial democracy had undermined both traditional
capitalisms and traditional socialisms. In the former, collaboration of the
wealthiest and most powerful private capitalists with the state apparatus

resulted in an undemocratic social and political oligarchy. In the latter,
collaboration of the wealthiest and most powerful state and private
economic enterprises with the state political apparatus resulted in much the
same. The effort to incorporate democracy into socialist frameworks taught
those engaged in the project that the same task applied to capitalism.
Systemic differences had blinded the 20th century to some basic similarities
between capitalism and conventional socialisms. One key similarity is the
internal structure or organization of workplaces and the related nature of the
relationship between workplaces and the state. In both systems —
recognizing all their variations — workplaces are organized in a starkly
undemocratic manner. As socialists moved toward democratizing
workplaces, socialism itself changed, resulting in the emergence of a major
new socialist tendency at the close of the 20th century. In both private and
state capitalisms ("actually existing socialisms"), workplaces display a basic
dichotomy between employers and employees. In private capitalisms, the
employers are not typically members of any state apparatus. Except in the
smallest of workplaces, employers are rather a
small minority of individuals engaged at the workplace. This minority
makes all the key workplace decisions, including what to produce, how, and
where, and what should be done with the output. The majority —
employees hired by the employers — are excluded from making such
decisions but are nonetheless required to accept and live with them. In
private capitalisms, employees can quit an employer, but that normally
requires them to enter another workplace organized in the same way. In
actually existing socialisms, state-regulated or state-owned and -operated
workplaces display this same dichotomy, or split. A small minority — in
this case, employers who are private citizens or state officials — hires the
majority, namely the employees who do most of the work. The minority
similarly excludes the majority from key workplace decisions. In
relationships between the state and workplaces, the employers, whether
private owners or state officials, are the intermediaries that "represent" the
workplace. The employees play a secondary role or no role at all in this
relationship. Outside the workplace, the mass of employees, as citizens,
might periodically elect a candidate to office, but it is these politicians who
subsequently enter state-workplace relationships with employers, whether
the latter be private proprietors or state officials like themselves. The

structure of this relationship serves to keep most employees removed from
all but occasional, marginal influences on economic events and curtails any
real economic democracy. Through these lessons, a growing number of
socialists have come to focus on worker cooperatives as a means to achieve
tangible economic democracy. Such socialists reject master/slave, lord/serf,
and employer/employee relationships because these all preclude real
democracy. Socialist proponents of worker cooperatives seek to construct
alternative workplaces that specifically avoid all such dichotomies. They do
so in the name of ending the inequalities these dichotomies have always
fostered and promoting the democracy such dichotomies have always
refused. The goal is a transition away from all employer/employee
workplace organizations toward those in which employees are also —
simultaneously and collectively — employers. This new kind of socialism
thus champions worker cooperatives where workers function
democratically as their own employers. Such ideas and aspirations are not
new. They have existed and circulated among slaves, serfs, and workers
who yearned for something better across the centuries. Collective
workplaces where workers directed themselves, often democratically,
existed in previous times and places. For example, individual serfs and
village communes sometimes organized workplaces in democratic ways
within European feudal societies. So too did craftspersons in some feudal
guilds. Toward the end of the 19th century, especially in France and Spain,
labor unions developed programs that went well beyond the confines of
collective bargaining with employers over wages and working conditions.
In a movement called "syndicalism" (after the French word for "labor
union," syndicat), workers demanded that labor unions replace capitalist
employers entirely so that the employees would become their own
employers. Other, anarchist, movements
included demands for workers controlling their own workplaces as well. In
short, there were many precursors for the idea and organization of worker
cooperatives. For the most part, however, the dominant theory and practice
of 19th-and 20th-century socialisms downplayed or marginalized
democratized workplaces. Especially following the reverses suffered by
late-20th-century socialisms, though, a new 21st-century socialism is busily
rediscovering, renewing, and reformulating programs for democratizing

workplaces. These programs now give priority and emphasis to worker
cooperatives in achieving a transition from capitalism to an alternative,
democratic economic order. In their modern forms, worker co-ops provide
all who labor inside a workplace — whether factory, office, or store — with
an equal voice on the key business decisions. Majorities determine what,
how, and where the workplace produces; how it uses or distributes its
outputs; and how it relates to the state. The state's direct partner in its
relationship to the workplace is no longer a minority, the employers, but
instead the entire collective of employee-owners. By democratizing
workplaces, worker co-ops can give shape to a real, daily democracy on a
society-wide basis. Democratized workplaces provide a foundation — an
institutional structure, habits of thinking and acting, training, and a model
— for a democratic politics in residential communities. In the past, the
undemocratic employer/employee relationship of capitalist and socialist
societies undermined workers' agency in politics. The very idea
of a real political democracy seemed remote, purely imaginary, and vaguely
Utopian. In contrast, a transition from employer/employee workplace
organization in private and state workplaces to an alternative worker co-op
organization establishes real democracy in the economic sphere. That in
turn offers better prospects for socialists to revitalize demands and
movements for a parallel democracy in the political one. An economy based
on worker co-ops would revolutionize the relationship between the state
and the people. In their capacity as a self-employed collectivity, workers
would occupy the spot traditionally held by the workplace in state-
workplace relations and interactions. The former go-between in the state-
workplace relationship — the employers — would be subsumed by the
collective of worker-owners. The workers would collectively and
democratically hold the purse strings to which the state would have to
appeal. The state would thus depend on citizens and workers rather than the
other way around. The state would depend on citizens in the usual
residence-based public arena of elections and voting (or their equivalents).
The state would also depend on workers in the other social arena: state-
workplace interactions. In both arenas, real democracy would have taken
giant steps forward. The state would no longer pretend to occupy the role of
neutral arbiter in struggles between master and slave, lord and serf,
employer and employee. The state would have fewer ways and means to

impose its own momentum and goals upon citizens or workplaces. To that
extent, the state's "withering away" would become more immediately
achievable than in any other variety of socialism known thus far.
The democratization of workplaces immediately raises the issue — indeed
the necessity — of extending that democratization to the people affected by
workplaces who are not workers there. The communities in which
workplaces function should have a democratic relationship with these
workplaces which, after all, pay taxes to these communities and make
decisions that can shape local traffic patterns, air quality, and so on. Such
should also be the case with customers and other stakeholders of worker co-
ops. Decisions reached inside democratized workplaces by their workers
must be shared with, and co-determined by, democratic decisions of
customers and affected localities and regions. Such co-determination would
also need to agree upon rules for developing, enforcing, and adjudicating
disputes and disagreements. A system of checks and balances among
workplaces, residential communities, and consumers would need to be
constructed. The key difference between the emerging socialism of the 21st
century and the previous socialist tradition is the former's advocacy of the
microeconomic transformation of the internal structure and organization of
workplaces. The transition from hierarchical, dichotomous
employer/employee organizations of workplaces to worker co-ops grounds
a bottom-up economic democracy on a wider, structural level. The new
socialism's difference from capitalism becomes less a matter of state versus
private workplaces, and state planning versus private markets, and more a
matter of democratic versus autocratic workplace organization. A new
economy based on worker co-ops will have to find its own democratic way
to structure relationships
among co-ops and society as a whole. Such an economy will need to work
out, for instance, the best proportion of planned versus market distributions,
and private versus public workplace ownership, as well as determine the
specific structure of laws and regulations. Worker co-ops are thus doing
anew what capitalist workplaces did in their emergence from a dying
feudalism. In this manner, the new socialism emerges from the practical
experiences and experiments of the old, and the theoretical self-criticisms it
provoked. In the new light of such a 21st-century socialism, history looks

different. We can see that the kingdoms banished from the public, political
sphere survived inside the private space of workplaces. Monarchy and
autocracy were not banished completely in the modern era but rather
relocated inside workplaces, where democracy was proscribed. These
autocratic spaces then provided their owner-monarchs with the means to
agitate against democracy in the political sphere. Before the end of political
monarchy, conservatives worried that civilization could not survive without
the sovereign leadership of the king and his court. Now, before the end of
capitalism, conservatives worry that the economy, and thus civilization
itself, cannot survive without the leadership of a boss and executives inside
workplaces. In response to this sentiment, profit incentives indeed motivate
employers to achieve success in our current economy. But the
employer/employee organization of the workplace produces tensions and
conflicts that will always yield counterproductive employee motivations. In
worker coops, employees tend to work harder and better because the
enterprise belongs to them, not their employers. In capitalist
workplaces, employers and employees struggle over the redistribution of
the wealth they produce. Those struggles worsen and embitter social
divisions. In worker co-ops, members democratically determine any
distribution of work and wealth precisely to prevent and preclude social
divisiveness. A new socialism focused on transforming workplaces into
worker co-ops offers a new generation of socialists a particularly effective
political strategy. The old tradition of socialism taught its enemies to focus
their critical counterattack on socialism's statist tendencies. Those enemies
are not prepared, at least not yet, to defend against a socialism defined
instead in terms of workplace democratization and employee ownership.
This unpreparedness gives socialists a strategic advantage. This new
socialism also provides a solid basis on which socialists can critically
appreciate and go beyond the old socialist tradition. The new socialism can
applaud how the old tradition built up powerful political parties, won power
in major countries, and spread interest and awareness of socialism across
the globe. Yet it can also confront and overcome the limits of the old
tradition, especially its statism, which shifted from being a means of
socialism's expansion to being a fetter on it. Worker co-ops have a long
history and a wide presence in today's world. To take one leading example
of the many thousands of worker co-ops across the world, the Corporation

Mondragon in the Basque region of Spain offers over half a century's
experience as proof of the viability of this economic model. Mondragon
started with six workers and now includes
over 80,000. It is now one of Spain's 10 largest corporations. Throughout its
history, it has found ways for small worker coops to mature into large ones
and even for worker co-ops to win against capitalist competitors within the
same industry. Mondragon has shown how worker co-ops can grow while
coexisting with capitalist workplaces within one society. Mondragon also
offers solid strategies for successful worker co-op relationships and
interactions with states. Of course, Mondragon's stunningly successful
growth was not without its reverses and rough patches, some of which
resulted from wider global factors; capitalism's cyclic instabilities; and the
co-op's own missteps, learning issues, and flaws. Modern societies, both
capitalist and socialist, have more than enough shortcomings — i.e.,
inequalities, instabilities, injustices, lack of real democracy — to enable and
provoke their citizens to pursue a promising alternative. The evidence,
theoretical and empirical, is here: Worker co-ops are that alternative. The
needed next step is to build worker co-op sectors across our contemporary
societies. That would allow citizens to encounter, work in, and buy from
worker co-ops alongside conventional private and state capitalist
workplaces. Such a sector would provide the basis for citizens to make
informed choices about what mix of alternative workplace organizations
work best. In the UK and the US, socialist political leaders like Jeremy
Corbyn and Bernie Sanders advocate governmental support for worker co-
ops. This support would entail laws giving employees a right of first refusal
when an employer considers certain basic changes in the enterprise.
Workers, for instance, might choose to buy an enterprise that would
otherwise be
sold to another individual or corporation and convert it into a worker co-op.
This support would also entail lending workers the initial funds at an
affordable rate to buy their enterprises. Finally, while such laws and funding
mechanisms in aid of coops are being developed, government support
would include organizing a massive public discussion and debate over the
issue of a social transition to a democratically organized economy. One
likely consequence of such transitions would be a redefinition of politics as

we know it now. Parties would likely reorganize along the lines of which
workplace organizations they favored and which they opposed. Where once
socialist parties represented opposition to capitalism, they have long since
morphed into parties advocating a kinder, gentler private capitalism with a
more or less admixture of state capitalism (that is, government regulation
and state-owned and - operated enterprises). In the wake of the emergence
of the new 21st-century socialism, the next phase of socialist organizing
would include advocating for, and helping to build, an economy based on
worker co-ops. Various center-left and center-right political formations —
including some socialist parties or wings of socialist parties — would
become explicitly what they always were implicitly: supporters of a
capitalist economy. Capitalists would be the base and support for such
parties, while worker co-ops would become the same for socialist parties.
Politics would again engage on a profound, regular, and hopefully non-
violent basis with the question of whether capitalism or socialism better
served the public good. The meanings of words and labels like "capitalism"
and "socialism" would themselves change as this new political landscape
emerged.
Worker co-ops are socialism's new vision and goal. They criticize the
inherited socialism of the past while adding something crucial to it: a
concrete vision of what an alternative, more just, and humane society would
look like. With the new focus on workplace democratization, socialists are
in a good position to contest the 21st century's struggle among economic
systems.

## Conclusion
To understand socialism now entails grasping how and why it is changing
from what it was in its first two centuries, 1800 to 2000. Those years saw
socialism grow from small, early, tentative experiments into mature national
political parties, reorganized societies, and important state administrations.
From several regional and national initiatives, it matured into an
international tradition of diverse interpretations of its post-capitalist visions.
Socialism inspired and produced a remarkable theoretical outpouring that
took the criticism of capitalism to many new levels of sophisticated
analyses, produced new critical literatures across all the disciplines, and
also generated original designs and blueprints for the possible socialisms of
the future. So fast and furious was socialism's growth and spread that its
empirical record of trials and errors, successes and failures, provoked
repeated periods of intense self-examination and self-criticism. Of these, the
greatest flowed from the demise of Eastern European socialism in the
1980s, the changes in China, capitalism's neoliberal
resurgence, and then the great capitalist crash of 2008 and since. So
profound was the impact on socialism of these key events of the last 40
years, that self-criticism went back to the roots of the tradition with basic
questions. Socialists came to understand that the early decades of any social
system are always times of experiments to find how to adjust theories and
practices — to change the system — so that it can successfully reproduce
itself and grow. Capitalism's early decades show that process. Socialists
discovered that their system's early experiences likewise taught valuable
lessons to those who dared to ask the questions and produce the answers.
One lesson learned was that socialism must shift its prioritized focus from
macro-to micro-level. The centrality of issues of ownership of the means of
production (private or state), and distribution of resources and products by
means of markets versus state planning, must be lessened. Instead,
socialists' concentrated attention should move toward issues of hierarchy
versus democracy inside workplaces. Socialists today are divided in how
they see, feel, and react to such changes in their tradition. Worker co-ops
already represent a key institutional embodiment of socialism's shifting
foci. Time and struggle will tell how and how far they will come to

represent the new socialism of the 21st century. There is no way to
understand socialism without understanding the yearnings for something
better than capitalism. Capitalism ceaselessly reproduced those yearnings
throughout its history. Socialism is capitalism's shadow, capitalism's
persistent critic. Intertwined, capitalism and socialism change each other
until their clashes finally result in
something new and different — a new system with its new self-critical
shadow. Like a bear emerging from hibernation, socialism today emerges
from capitalism's often vicious, repressive effort to kill its own shadow. Of
course that effort failed. Failure is built into capitalism's contradictions. But
a revived socialism's new opportunities leave open the question of how well
socialists see them, embrace their implications, and rebuild social
movements strong enough to realize those opportunities. It is a question of
21st-century socialism responding adequately to those human yearnings to
do better. We hope this book helps fashion such a response.

About the Cover:
The Red Rose as a Symbol of Socialism
The cover has been created by artist Luis de la Cruz. Luis is a graduate of
Occidental College and also works as a firefighter. He has been illustrating
portraits, cartoons, comic books, and t-shirt designs for organizations and
individuals since high school. You can see more of Luis's work at
www.luisdelacruzstudio.com. The color red used on this cover has been a
symbol of socialism since the French Revolution of 1848. After the fall of
the Paris Commune in 1871, German Chancellor Bismarck, fearing a
similar revolutionary outbreak in Germany, passed anti-Socialist laws that
banned the red socialist flag. Getting around these laws, socialists began
wearing small pieces of red ribbon to subtly show their political leanings.
When these too were banned, they began to wear red roses. Socialists were
arrested and jailed for wearing both the ribbons and the roses, and the push
back on this eventually brought one's right to wear a flower to court. A
judge finally ruled that citizens had a right to wear any flower of any color
they wished, but that when a group of citizens gathered wearing red roses
together, this constituted a socialist symbol. The symbol of the red rose
spread across Europe and to the US as socialists were exiled from France
and Germany. By 1910, it was generally recognized as a symbol of
socialism. Today, the red rose in a fist is the symbol of Socialist
International (a worldwide organization of political parties), and the French
Socialist Party. The red rose is also the symbol of the British Labour Party.
Thus, the red rose was an obvious choice for the cover of Understanding
Socialism. We chose to show multiple roses as a demonstration of the
growth and spread of socialism. Leaving romanticism aside, our roses are
straight, tall, proud, and strong. The roses in the back are of a more faded
opacity compared to the front in order to show a passing of older versions
of socialism and the strength and rebirth of the new. Bread and Roses As we
come marching, marching, in the beauty of the day, A million darkened
kitchens, a thousand mill-lofts gray Are touched with all the radiance that a
sudden sun discloses, For the people hear us singing "Bread and Roses,
Bread and Roses." As we come marching, marching, we battle, too, for men

— For they are women's children and we mother them again. Our days shall
not be sweated from birth until life closes-Hearts starve as well as bodies:
Give us Bread, but give us Roses. As we come marching marching,
unnumbered women dead Go crying through our singing their ancient song
of Bread; Small art and love and beauty their trudging spirits knew— Yes, it
is Bread we fight for—but we fight for Roses, too. As we come marching
marching we bring the Greater Days— The rising of the women means the
rising of the race. No more the drudge and idler—ten that toil where one
reposes— But a sharing of life's glories: Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses.
Poem by James Oppenheim, published 1911. Popularized in music by Mimi
Farina, Judy Collins, and Joan Baez.

About Democracy at Work
Democracy at Work is a nonprofit 501(c)3 that produces media and live
events. Based on the book Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism by
Richard D. Wolff, our work analyzes capitalism critically as a systemic
problem and advocates for democratizing workplaces as part of a systemic
solution. We seek a stronger, fuller democracy - in our politics and culture
as well as in our economy - based on workers' equal collaboration and
shared leadership inside enterprises and throughout society. Democracy at
Work produces the show Economic Update with Richard D. Wolff and
Global Capitalism Live Economic Update, as well as the podcasts David
Harvey's Anti-Capitalist Chronicles, Capitalism Hits Home with Dr. Harriet
Fraad, and All Things Co-op. Each of these is a collaborative effort, and are
brought to you by the hard work and dedication of a small team of workers.
To keep costs low, we work via a digital office and rely on donated time
from Prof. Wolff as well as other volunteer contributors, like Prof. David
Harvey and Dr. Harriet Fraad. We are a 501(c)3 but operate internally as a
cooperative to better embody the ideals we believe are a critical part of
effective system change. Learn more: www.democracyatwork.info
