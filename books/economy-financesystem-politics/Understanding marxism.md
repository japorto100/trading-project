## Preface
Brexit, Trump, and the global anti-immigrant, anti-foreigner, right-wing
wave show just how deeply troubled capitalism is after the 2008 crash.
They replicate what happened in many places after capitalism’s 1929 crash.
Millions are frightened by economic decline. Neither education nor media
nor engagement with critical political movements had prepared them for
another crash and the subsequent lost decade that lingers. So many strike
out in rage and desperation for change that might somehow help reverse the
threatening downward spiral.
Given the previous half-century of Cold War and its effects on politics,
culture and ideology, it was hardly surprising that major early surges of
political protest took right-wing forms. Millions turned against political
establishments that presided over the economic forces that led to the crash,
then bailed out those who caused it and imposed harsh austerities on all
those victimized by it. Voting socialist mostly failed as major socialist
parties had accommodated to the dominant neoliberalism.
Now some grasp the error they made even as others reproduce it. Those
frustrated with the capitalist system search for and find better answers than
merely ousting political establishments. Wanting deeper, more critical
analyses of what went so badly wrong in contemporary society and political
economy, they dare ask... about system change.
Thus they find their way to the critique of capitalism stemming from the
Marxian tradition, and discover all that it has to offer. All that was kept
from political, academic, and mediatic discourses for so long.
There are rising demands for accessible introductions to Marxism and to the
social changes it suggests. This essay responds to that interest. It seeks to
provide bases for real solutions now that the flaws and failures of
contemporary capitalism are exposed: goods delivered chiefly to the 1%,
the rest mocked with outrageous inequality, instability, and grossly
reactionary political leaders.
Marxism always was the critical shadow of capitalism. Their interactions
changed them both. Now Marxism is once again stepping into the light as

capitalism shakes from its own excesses and confronts decline. Hopefully
this essay can help our era's renewal of Marxism.

## Chapter I
“The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class
struggles.” – Karl Marx
We offer this essay now because of the power and usefulness today of
Marx’s criticism of the capitalist economic system. Capitalism has spread
since Marx’s time to become today’s global system. Along the way, it
changed in many ways. Yet its core remained a particular kind of economic
system, uniquely different from the slave, feudal, and other systems of
human history. Capitalism’s way of producing and distributing goods and
services retains the basic structure, dynamic, flaws and injustices that Marx
so acutely criticized.
Why should we pay attention to the great social critics like Marx? Critics
see and understand any society differently from its admirers. To understand
anything, intelligent people consider society directly but also consider how
others see and understand it. Thus, they consider (1) what those people
believe who like it, but also (2) what those people believe who don't like it.
From all those considerations, thoughtful conclusions are drawn.
As an example, imagine wanting to understand the family that lives up the
road (mama, papa, and their two kids). Let’s suppose we know one kid
thinks it’s the greatest family there ever was, and the other one thinks it’s a
basket case of psychological dysfunction. To study the family, it would be
bizarre to choose to talk to only one child. Basic honesty would require us
to talk with both children, ask questions, hear what each has to say, as well
as interview and observe the parents and the family together, etc. On the
basis of all that we then draw our own conclusions about that family,
making the best judgment we can.
So it is with understanding capitalism. It requires that we consider the
system directly but also consider the assessments of critics as well as
admirers or celebrants.
This process becomes extra difficult when the larger social context is an
extremely polarized confrontation between critics and celebrants of
capitalism.

We must all acknowledge that words like Marx and Marxism, socialism,
communism, and all that, have been scare words for many people for many
years. In the US, even before the Cold War erupted, capitalism’s defenders
and admirers often demonized capitalism’s critics as dangerous, disloyal,
foreign, and/or anti-American, anti-Christian, and so on. Since 1945,
Americans were widely taught, encouraged or pressed to view socialism,
communism, Marxism, the USSR, etc. with fear, anxiety, and hatred.
Therefore, most Americans paid little or no attention to the work of Karl
## Marx.
Teachers at all levels either ignored that work or subjected it to brief
dismissive treatments. Business leaders, journalists, and academics learned
(or rather, did not learn) from those teachers and so replicated their
ignorance or dismissals of Marx and Marxism. It took the latest crash of
capitalism in 2008 to shock many into the realization that capitalism had
remained the same old unstable economic system it had always been.
Likewise, American capitalism’s rush into extreme inequality undermined
the widespread assertion that “capitalism delivers the goods,” or at least
exposed that it delivered a lot more to the 1% than to the other 99%. The
last few years have thus seen a global renewal of critical attitudes toward
capitalism. Those evolved quickly into renewed interest in studying what
capitalism’s critics have to say and offer as a systemic alternative. This
essay reflects and also seeks to contribute to those renewals.
For the last 200 years, capitalism’s leading critics have been Karl Marx and
the diverse tendencies deeply influenced by Marx’s work. In other words,
Marxism has been the leading tradition of thought and practice critical of
capitalism. It represents the ideas and experiences accumulated across
generations around the globe who tried and try to move society beyond
capitalism using Marx’s critical insights. Marx and Marxism are as
important on the side of criticizing capitalism as Adam Smith, David
Ricardo, and John Maynard Keynes are on the side of those who celebrate
capitalism.

Chapter II
"The mode of production of material life determines the social, political and
intellectual life process in general." – Karl Marx
What motivated Karl Marx, as a young man growing up in the middle of
19th century Europe, to become a critic of capitalism? The answer is partly
the American and French revolutions of the late 18th century. Marx
particularly embraced their key demands: in France, liberty, equality,
brotherhood and in the US, democracy. He wanted those demands to be
realized in modern society. He believed that the capitalism advocated by the
French and American revolutionaries was a better system than the feudal,
slave and other previous systems of human history. He believed as well –
like so many other young people of his time - that capitalism would bring
with it the liberty, equality, brotherhood and democracy that the French and
American revolutionaries had promised it would.
But the roughly 75 years that separated his arrival at adulthood from the
French and American revolutions presented Marx with a profoundly
challenging contradiction. The revolutions had succeeded in establishing
capitalism. It was pulsating and growing all around him in Western Europe.
Gone or going were the old economic systems of masters and slaves, lords
and serfs. In their places were relatively “free” men and women in the new
capitalist system of employers and employees. But the capitalism Marx saw
and lived in had not established liberty, equality, fraternity or real
democracy. Moreover, it showed few signs of moving in such directions.
Instead, when Karl Marx looked around the Europe of his time, he saw
pretty much what emerged, for example in the novels of Charles Dickens
(or of Emile Zola, Maxim Gorky, and Jack London). He found an enormous
gap between a relatively small part of the population that was well-off, well
educated, literate and comfortable, and a mass of agricultural, industrial and
service workers who were suffering: poor, uneducated and often illiterate.
Marx felt that capitalism had betrayed the promise that had led so many
people he admired to support ending feudalism, slavery, etc., with bloody
revolutions where needed. Capitalism had failed to deliver liberty, equality,
fraternity and democracy.

And so he set himself a goal. “What happened?” was the great question for
him. Why did capitalism not keep its promise? Had it tried and failed? And
if so, why? The research he undertook, which he and his closest associates
then wrote up, comprises Marx’s contribution, his critical understanding of
capitalism.
He discovered that the reason why capitalism failed to realize liberty,
equality, fraternity and democracy, was that its own structure and
social effects were themselves obstacles to realizing those lofty goals. In
making that discovery, Marx retained those goals as his own.
Marx eventually drew the conclusion that genuine progress toward
achieving liberty, equality, fraternity and democracy required a change of
economic system from capitalism to what he called socialism.
The research that led to this conclusion was deeply historical. The history of
economic systems before capitalism provided Marx with crucial clues. The
two systems on which Marx focused his attention were slavery and
feudalism.
Slave economic systems divide the human beings engaged in producing and
distributing goods and services into two groups: masters and slaves. Wealth,
power and cultural dominance lie exclusively in the hands of the masters.
Slaves are the property of masters. In general, slaves do the work of
production and distribution while masters mostly supervise the slaves. Past
slave societies were shaped, governed and run by the masters, who
reproduced the system across time. Masters wanted to stay masters; their
children became masters in turn. If you were born into that society as a
slave, you almost always remained a slave, and your children would be
slaves. In their relationship to masters, slaves partook very little of liberty,
equality, fraternity or democracy.
In feudal economic systems, the positions of master and slave disappear and
are replaced by lord and serf. In European feudalism, lords supervised and
dominated the serfs who did the work, much as the masters had done in
relation to slaves. However, while serfs were not property as slaves were,
they were born into the social position occupied by their parents, as was the
case with slaves.

In relation to slavery and feudalism as economic systems, capitalism was at
once different and similar. It was different because the revolutionaries who
overthrew previous systems to establish capitalism generally insisted on
freeing slaves and serfs from their subordinate position and declaring all
free and equal. None could be bound into slave-like or serf-like servitudes;
thus they could enjoy liberty from those servitudes.
Finally, capitalism’s defenders and advocates generally supported political
democratization extending the one-person-one-vote in politics to ever-larger
proportions of adult populations.
Capitalism was, however, similar to slavery and feudalism in a central,
crucial dimension. Marx establishes this central point early in Volume 1 of
Capital as part of his explanation of “exploitation.” In slavery, the slaves
produce the goods and services that become entirely – 100% - the
immediate property of the master (as is the slave). The master decides
whether, when, how, and how much of the slaves’ output will be returned to
the slave for the latter’s reproduction (food, clothing, shelter, etc.). This
result can be expressed by dividing the length of the slaves’ working days
into two portions: one is the portion whose products are returned to the
slaves for their consumption. Marx called this the slaves’ “necessary labor.”
The second portion of the slaves’ labor yields products kept and used by the
master; Marx called this “surplus labor.” It was labor done by slaves beyond
that necessary for whatever level of reproduction masters allowed them.
The same sort of reasoning applies to feudalism. There the serf is assigned
land to cultivate part of the time and with the proviso that the products of
that time on that land are to be kept by the serf for the consumption of
his/her family unit. Another portion of the serf’s working time is assigned to
be done on the domain of the lord who also keeps the product of that
portion. Necessary labor is then what the serf does on the land assigned to
him/her, while surplus labor is that portion of the serf’s total labor time
deployed on the lord’s domain. Marx referred to slaves and serfs as
“exploited” laborers precisely because (and to the extent that) a portion of
their labor and its products were appropriated by persons other than the
laborers themselves.
Marx’s argument then hits home: capitalism remains like slavery and
feudalism because (1) it too divides the participants producing and

distributing goods and services into two groups (employers and
employees), and (2) it too divides the laborer’s working day into
necessary and surplus portions.
It is merely the forms of these divisions that differ among slavery,
feudalism and capitalism; the divisions themselves are substantially the
same. In capitalism, the employee agrees to work, say for a week, and to
receive their pay Friday afternoon. During the week, the employee’s labor
contributes to the total product sold by the employer at week’s end. The
revenue from that total product sold is composed of one part that equals the
cost of the inputs used up in producing that total product; that part is
normally used to replace those used-up inputs. The rest of the employer’s
revenue is divided into two portions: one is given to the employee as wages,
while the other is retained by the employer for their consumption or use.
Wages are the products of the laborer’s necessary labor time; revenues
retained by the employer are the products of the laborer’s surplus labor
time. The “free” laborer of capitalism – the person who sells his/her labor
power in exchange for wages – is exploited just like the “unfree” labor of
slaves and serfs.
Capitalism, Marx said, never went beyond those economic models
where a few dominate a majority. Capitalism just replaced the
dichotomies of master/slave and lord/serf with a new one. A dominating
and exploiting minority was still there, but it had a new name:
employers.
A dominated and exploited majority was still there but with its new name:
employees. As had happened with slavery and feudalism, capitalism’s
dominant minority played and plays the dominant social role. Employers
control the politicians and the direction of social development; they make
all key decisions in the workplace; they run the show. The masses of people
are subordinated.
Marx showed that one key foundation for capitalism’s failure to realize
liberty, equality, fraternity and democracy was the internal organization of
the capitalist enterprise. There, a tiny group of people at the top (major
owners and top executives) make all the key decisions regarding what, how,
and where to produce and what to do with the fruits of their employees’

surplus labor. The employees are systematically excluded from making
those decisions, but they must live with the results of those decisions.
That’s not democracy; that is its opposite.
Marx died in 1883. In the 135 years since then, his ideas spread to every
country on earth. People in very different economic, political and cultural
conditions found enormous meaning in what Marx, and later Marxists,
wrote, said and did. Every country on the planet includes Marxist
organizations, Marxist unions, Marxist newspapers, Marxist societies,
Marxist political parties and so on. They all found meaning in Marxism, and
they still do.

Chapter III
“The human being is in the most literal sense a political animal, not merely
a gregarious animal, but an animal which can individuate itself only in the
midst of society.” – Karl Marx
A major part of Marx’s contribution was in economics. He was a broadly
engaged and educated European intellectual of his time when relatively few
people were educated or even literate. Formally trained in philosophy, he
began his adult working life as a professor of philosophy. However, his
interests in the world around him moved him quickly to become what we
would nowadays call an economist. Here we present the core finding of his
economic studies before following his fascinating elaboration of that core.
In every human society, from the earliest records we know to the present,
people produce and distribute something Marx called a surplus. We may
begin by explaining what Marx meant by this.
In every society, he says, human beings survive by labor: transforming
nature to meet their needs. They convert wool into clothing to keep warm,
trees to build shelters from the rain and the storm, land into food, and so on.
In laboring, humans use their brains and muscles to transform nature into
useful consumable products upon which human societies depend.
But not all people work, not all use their brains and muscles to transform
nature. There are always parts of each human society – large and small –
that do not work. Those parts survive if and only if the members of the
society who do work produce more than they themselves consume. That
output exceeding what the workers themselves consume is what Marx
means by a surplus. That surplus, if distributed to people other than the
workers who produced it, enables such other people to survive and function
in the society. Babies are one example of those other people who couldn't
possibly use their brains and muscles to transform nature because they
haven't managed to stand up yet. Some members of society must produce
surpluses if babies are to survive by living off that surplus.
In most societies the producers of surpluses – Marx calls them productive
laborers precisely because they produce a surplus – distribute them to more
than the society’s babies. Children, the sick and the elderly are often

recipients of surpluses. So too are people capable of producing surpluses,
but who do not do so. The surpluses produced by some members of human
societies sustain the members who live off the surplus distributed to them.
We may begin with an illustrative example of a slave society. When the
slave works on a slave plantation, everything he or she produces belongs
immediately and automatically to the master. Typically, the master gives a
portion of the slave’s surplus back to the slave (in the forms of food,
clothing, shelter and so on). The goal is to enable the slave to work again
tomorrow. The master uses another portion of the slave’s output to replenish
the tools, equipment and raw materials used up during the slave’s work.
The rest of what the slave produces is the slave's surplus. Like every other
portion of the slave’s output, the slave’s surplus also belongs to the master.
The master takes that surplus and uses it to fund the master’s consumption,
the master’s personal servants and retainers, and any other people whose
social activity the master deems necessary to support. The master uses a
portion of the slave surplus to support that activity because it helps to
reproduce the slave system over which the master presides. For example,
the master might pay (distribute a share of the slave surplus to) a group of
bandits to capture and return runaway slaves.
The people who live off shares of slave surpluses distributed to them by
masters may be engaged in labor using their brains and muscles. But they
do not themselves produce surpluses. For that reason, they are, for Marx,
unproductive laborers. Ever the social critic and theorist, Marx wants to
underscore the difference between those workers who produce surpluses
from those who live off distributions of surplus from others. He sees that
difference as having all sorts of important implications for the two groups
of workers’ different attitudes toward the existing system, toward projects
of going beyond that system, etc. He likewise underscores the differences
between productive and unproductive workers so that what they have in
common – for example, they might all be slaves – does not obscure their
differences: a matter of the utmost importance for any political project of
unifying all slaves into a powerful social force.
The master lives off the surplus. The master does not tend the cotton fields,
nor raise the fruits and vegetables, the cheese, the butter or the meat. The
productive slaves do all of that. They produce more cotton than they need to
clothe themselves, more food and clothing than they need for themselves,

and all that “more” – in kind or else in money if it is marketed - is delivered
to the master. The master uses it to keep this kind of society going. The
master sits at the top; the master has the power; the master is sustained by
the surplus of the slaves.
Much the same logic figures in Marx’s analysis of feudalism. The
productive workers there are serfs, and the surplus they produce is delivered
to the lord. In Europe, the name given to the feudal surplus was “rent.”
Lords lived off the rents they obtain from the serfs they exploited; they
often used those rents to sustain servants, etc., who thus also lived off the
feudal surplus as feudalism’s unproductive laborers.
Now to Marx's main point: in capitalism, we find the same basic
exploitation found inside slave and feudal economic systems. It is disguised
in and by the formalities of the employer-employee system. In Capital’s
first volume, Marx penetrates the disguise to show how the relationship
between employer and employee includes the particularly capitalist form of
producing and distributing a surplus.
Imagine yourself as a job seeker discussing employment with an employer
whose enterprise makes ladders. After going over other details of the job,
you come to the wage issue and agree on $20 per hour for a 9 to 5 job from
Monday through Friday. The employer believes that employing you – as
with all other productive laborers hired – will add quality and/or quantity to
the enterprise’s output of ladders and thus more sales revenue as well.
Marx then explains what most workers at least instinctively intuit. An
employer will only pay a productive worker $20 per hour if during that
hour more than $20 worth of sales revenue results. In that more, Marx
tells us, lies the surplus in its capitalist form.
The value added (to the value of the tools, equipment and raw materials
used up in production) by each worker’s hour of labor exceeds the value
paid to the worker for that hour’s labor. The difference between value added
and wage paid is the surplus produced by the worker in a capitalist
enterprise. The employer captures the surplus within the revenue obtained
when the enterprise’s output is sold. The employer divides that revenue into
three portions. One is used to replace/replenish the tools, equipment and
raw materials used up in producing the enterprise’s output. Another portion

goes to the hired workers as wages. And the third comprises the surplus
retained and thus appropriated by the employing capitalist.
Like the productive labor of slaves and serfs, that of employees is exploited:
they all produce surpluses for others. Only the forms of the capitalist
surplus and of the capitalist exploitative relationship distinguish them from
their parallels in slavery and feudalism.
At the productive core of capitalism, in the relationship there between
employer and employee, the latter produces surpluses appropriated by the
former. In this exploitation, Marx locates a key obstacle that prevents
capitalism from achieving its promised effects of liberty, equality,
brotherhood and democracy. The latter’s absences in slavery and feudalism
derived likewise from the exploitative relationships at their productive
cores. Marx’s conclusion follows: to achieve liberty, equality, brotherhood
and democracy in any society, any exploitative production relationship must
be excluded.
For a minority to appropriate and distribute the surplus produced by a
majority is inconsistent with and undermines the progressive social
goals advocated by the French and American revolutions and given lip
service everywhere ever since.
Marxist writings have often spoken of “wage slaves.” That was not just a
casual remark. It links the condition of the wage earner to that of the slave.
Looking at wage earners’ freedom through the lens of Marx’s surplus theory
exposes that freedom as illusory. In capitalism, most workers are trapped
into being either a wage-earner producing surplus for an employer or else a
wage-earner serving an employer and living off the distribution of some
other productive worker’s surplus. Freedom requires changing the system
because otherwise you are forever trapped in it.
Marx argues that exploitative societies typically use their surpluses to
maintain that exploitation. Masters use the surplus taken from slaves to
maintain slavery; lords use their serfs’ surplus to maintain feudalism.
Capitalists likewise use the surplus appropriated from productive workers to
reproduce the social relations of capitalism, the society of employers and
employees. This means giving capitalists – and their delegated
representatives – the dominant positions not only in the economy but also in
politics and culture.

In capitalism - a hundred years ago, fifty years ago, or right now - it’s
the employer class that is socially dominant. Marx’s contribution was
to locate in production the fundamental mechanism whereby this
domination is secured.
In his discussion of surpluses and exploitation, Marx developed his own
unique concept of class, a concept different from the traditional, pre-
Marxist conceptions. Before Marx (indeed, for thousands of years) many
people had classified populations into sub-groups according to how much
wealth they owned or how much power over others they wielded. Those
who focused on wealth separated the propertied from the propertyless, the
rich from the poor, and, of course, middle classes from those above and
below them. Those who focused on power distinguished rulers from ruled,
powerful from powerless, etc. For all these people class was a category
dividing and thereby describing people according to the distributions of
property or power among them. Marx made use of those old concepts
(categories, definitions) of class in crafting his social criticism. In this, he
followed many who had done likewise before him and were doing the same
alongside him.
However, unlike those others, Marx also invented and used another,
different concept of class: one based on his surplus analysis. There was the
class of surplus producers, the class of surplus appropriators, and the class
of those receiving shares of the surplus distributed to them by the
appropriators. The conflicts among them undermined capitalists’ often-
repeated commitments to liberty, equality, brotherhood and democracy. Put
in other terms, Marx invented and used his surplus-based concepts of class
to explain why previous social critics of grossly unequal distributions of
wealth and power had so far been unable to overcome those social
injustices. They had not understood that changing the organization of the
surplus was a necessary accompaniment of any other program aimed to
reduce inequalities in the social distributions of wealth and power. They had
not understood why ending exploitation was necessary to actualize social
commitments to liberty, equality, brotherhood and democracy. The class
conflicts Marx focused his attention on (for example in Marx’s three
volumes of Capital) were chiefly about the production and distribution of
the surplus and only secondarily about the social distributions of property
and power.

Chapter IV
“As in private life one differentiates between what a man thinks and says of
himself and what he really is and does, so in historical struggles one must
still more distinguish the language and the imaginary aspirations of parties
from their real organism and their real interests, their conception of
themselves from their reality.” – Karl Marx
In modern capitalism, the products of capitalist enterprises take the form of
commodities. That means they pass from producer to consumer by means of
an intermediate process, namely market exchanges. Capitalist enterprises
“buy” their commodity inputs, hire (another word for buy) the labor power
of their laborers, and sell the commodity outputs produced by combining
inputs and laborers in work. A distinguishing sign of capitalism is that the
ability to work – labor power – itself becomes a commodity to be bought
and sold. Labor power was not a commodity in the slave and feudal
economic systems.
Capitalist businesses obtain revenues, money earned by selling their output
commodities. Their revenues typically exceed the sum of money spent
buying input commodities (the tools, equipment and raw materials used up
in production) plus money spent buying labor power. In short, revenues
exceed costs of production. That excess is the surplus.
One implication of Marx’s analysis is that the class of employers will
always seek to reduce the wages paid to their hired, productive laborers.
Likewise, employers will always seek to lengthen the time and pace of
work.
The reasons for both pressures lie in the simple arithmetic of capitalist
exploitation: the greater the value added by the laborers and the
smaller the portion returned to them as wages, the greater the surplus
acquired by the capitalist.
As we discuss further below, the more surplus the capitalist can get from
the surplus-producing laborers, the more funds the capitalist has to
consume, grow, compete and secure the system that puts the capitalist on
top. Productive laborers will likewise always seek higher wages as their
standard of living (and that of their family) usually depends on those wages.

Class struggle is the unavoidable result of capitalism.
Over the last three centuries, capitalism has successfully reproduced itself
while spreading to become the dominant organization of production in the
world. However, as Marx pointed out, capitalism’s operations and
reproduction were as “efficient” in producing wealth as in producing
poverty. Poverty has proved to be a continuing “problem” for capitalism
that it never eradicated.
For Marx, to eradicate poverty you need to change to an economic
system other than capitalism.

## Chapter V
“As capitalist, he is only capital personified. His soul is the soul of capital.
But capital has one single life impulse, the tendency to create value and
surplus-value, to make its constant factor, the means of production, absorb
the greatest possible amount of surplus-labour.” – Karl Marx
We turn next to the distribution of capitalist surpluses. That distribution
illustrates how capitalism’s organization of the surplus deeply influences so
many other aspects of societies where it exists (and especially where it
prevails). Capitalists distribute significant portions of the surplus they
appropriate to themselves for their consumption. They do so both for
personal satisfaction and to underscore their differences (in homes, dress,
transport, etc.) from the wage-earners. The differences in consumption level
– results of the inequality produced and sustained by capitalism – can then
be transformed ideologically into signs of inherent attributes of individuals
that make some surplus appropriators and others surplus producers. Just as
earlier societies had made the inequalities resulting from slavery and
feudalism matters caused rather by nature or God, in capitalism strong
ideological tendencies make inherent individual variability (“human
nature”) the cause. It too, like nature and God, cannot be changed by mere
mortals. The passing social convention – made and changed by society –
becomes instead moored and unmovable in cement. Those who rule
societies need desperately to believe and have others believe their positions
are permanent.
Just as importantly, capitalists distribute other portions of the surplus they
appropriate to all sorts of managers and supervisors to perform tasks needed
for the surplus to be produced. Those tasks are not themselves productive of
surpluses, but they are crucial to the production of surplus by others. This
distinction matters. The personnel manager in a modern capitalist
corporation does not labor with machines to transform raw materials into
commodities for sale. Such a manager controls and maneuvers productive
laborers but is not one of them. The salary and equipment such a manager
uses represent costs to the capitalist defrayed by distributions of the surplus.
In capitalism, as Marx makes so clear, the capitalist has to distribute much
of the surplus to others in order to keep on getting surplus. Without

personnel managers, the surplus-producing workers might produce less
surplus or none at all.
The manager in this case is an unproductive laborer. His work provides a
necessary condition of existence for surplus production by other, productive
laborers. The latter are performers of surplus labor; the manager is an
enabler of their productive labor. For capitalism to reproduce itself, it
requires performers and enablers, productive and unproductive laborers, but
that does not mean their differences do not matter. Quite the contrary: in
every exploitative economic system, the two different kinds of laborers
have played varying roles in supporting or overthrowing the system, in
seeking political alliances with each other or alternatively with surplus
appropriators. In slavery, for example, field and house slaves exhibited
varying relationships. So too did serfs assigned to agriculture versus crafts.
Capitalism has had its blue and white collar employees. To Marx’s credit,
his surplus theory – and the class analysis built on it – grasped the deeper,
systemic importance of these differences.
Capitalists distribute surpluses to yet other sorts of recipients for other
purposes. For example, capitalists distribute surpluses as funds to managers
charged with purchasing and installing more or better machines, tools,
equipment, etc. Their goals might be to increase the scale of production or
to replace labor power (automation) or both. What drives such distributions
of the surplus is the competition among capitalists. Each fears that
competitors will acquire machines or other inputs that enable more products
at a lower cost; each hopes to be such an acquirer. With similar motivations,
capitalists can direct surplus distributions to cover costs of relocating
production to lower wage areas or recruiting workers from elsewhere (i.e.,
immigrants and outsourced labor) willing to work at lower wages.
Capitalists distribute portions of the surpluses they appropriate to fund
whatever other conditions of existence that seem to them to need it.
For production sites threatened by thievery, for example, surplus may pay
wages for the unproductive labor of security officers. Where productive
laborers exhibit alcohol-related problems, capitalists may hire the
unproductive labor power of personnel managers or counselors to help
solve those problems. If litigation is a risk, capitalists will use surpluses to
retain lawyers. Portions of the surplus must also be paid to federal, state

and/or local governments in taxes, dividends to shareholders, interest to
lenders and so on.
For Marx, the capitalist functions at the center of a complex system. On the
one hand, the capitalist strives to appropriate the greatest possible surplus
from hired productive laborers. On the other hand, the same capitalist must
guess how best to distribute different portions of the appropriated surplus to
various recipients (enablers, unproductive laborers) who provide conditions
of existence for the capitalist enterprise.
No wonder capitalism develops unevenly – as Marx stressed. Each
competing capitalist decides and functions around guesses about present
and future realities. Each capitalist guesses differently because the
circumstances of each and how these circumstances are assessed and
understood vary. One succeeds and another fails giving capitalism its
uneven development path. Deep suspicions of one another and even deeper
suspicion of any state coordination keep capitalists from overcoming the
systemic unevenness. Likewise, capitalism develops unevenly
geographically as 'developed' and 'undeveloped' areas proliferate and even
sometimes replace one another.

Chapter VI
“Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and
personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as a
tragedy, the second time as a farce.” – Karl Marx
Another remarkable quality of Marx’s and many Marxists’ analyses, besides
specific insights drawn from their surplus-focused analysis, is their
attention to contradictions. Beyond the tendencies they find shaping
societies, they usually seek and find counteracting tendencies and likewise
elements inside all tendencies that push them and society in different and
often clashing directions. This sensitivity to and interest in contradictions
derives in part from Marx’s teacher, the German philosopher Hegel. In
Hegel’s view, everything is contradictory. Everything in life (nature,
society, etc.) is a bundle of conflicting needs, forces and pressures. Indeed,
our thoughts about and knowledge of life are also inescapably
contradictory.
For Marx, capitalism too exemplifies contradictions. As one example, Marx
explains to us that every capitalist tries to get as much surplus from
productive workers as possible. The more surplus that is appropriated, the
more can be distributed as dividends to keep shareholders happy, as high
salaries to motivate managers, etc. The surplus distributions keep the
capitalist system going, reinforcing the capitalists’ dominance. Since more
surplus available to the capitalist is better, capitalists always seek more.
Greed is not the cause of capitalists’ behavior; it is a quality they
acquire in accommodating to and internalizing the requirements of
competitive survival within the capitalist system.
Capitalists may appropriate more surplus if they reduce workers’ wages
while getting the same output from them. There are alternative ways to
accomplish such wage reductions. Immigration of lower wage workers is a
famous phenomenon in capitalist societies past and present. So too is
switching from one population group to another (for example, from men to
women, from adults to children, from one ethnicity to another, and so on).
Of course, both these wage-reduction mechanisms entail contradictions as
displaced wage-earners resent and resist. That may place new demands on

capitalists’ surpluses (say to offset enterprise damage from angry displaced
workers) that nullify the gains from lower wages and so on. Lower-paid
workers may display less loyalty to the enterprise. The contradictions
abound and may, depending on the larger social context, overwhelm the
initial capitalist impulse/tendency to lower wages.
Besides lowering wages, production costs may be reduced when capitalists
can replace productive workers with machines. To automate, computerize
or robotize may be cheaper than – and therefore substitute for – hiring
productive workers. However, no sooner do capitalists succeed in paying
lower wages and/or hiring fewer workers, than they may well face another
contradiction. The workers may now have less income than they had before
because wages fell or automation hit. Thus they will be less able to buy
what capitalists need to sell. To benefit by lowering their outlays to
workers, capitalists have inadvertently undermined the demand for their
products. The virtually universal drive to economize on labor costs operates
in contradiction to the parallel drive to sell all that is produced.
The system is a contradiction: the very logic imposed on the capitalist
undermines the overall success of the capitalist. For Marxists, no law,
rule, regulation, or behavior pattern provides an escape from this
contradiction; none ever has.
Capitalism experiences this contradiction in the form of recurring
oscillations between periods of profit-boosting savings on labor costs and
profit-busting insufficiencies of effective demand for capitalist products.
That is how this system works. And of course, workers laid off because of
automation or deficient demand may well worsen that deficiency and
thereby produce a spiral downward into major recession or depression.
Eventually, downturns produce a sufficient cheapening of labor power and
produced inputs to enable capitalists to profit from resuming production.
Then an upswing follows and repeats the same pattern of cyclical instability
yet again.
Because of this and other contradictions explored across the three volumes
of Capital, the capitalist system is profoundly unstable. Every four to seven
years on average, wherever it has existed, capitalism produced an economic
downturn. Workers suddenly lost jobs, businesses collapsed, and real mass
suffering ensued for months or years. This instability occurred in addition to

the destabilizing effects of natural disasters (floods, droughts, etc.) and of
social disasters (wars). Any individual exhibiting a personal instability
comparable to the economic and social instability of capitalism would long
ago have been required to seek professional help and to make basic
changes.
Marx’s basic point is that capitalism produces and reproduces
inequality and instability. That alone suggests we ought to challenge
anyone who accepts a system that works this way.
Through the work of Marx and others, we can now recognize capitalism’s
contradictions plus the inadequacies and injustices they impose on us. It is
precisely how the system works – how in particular it produces,
appropriates, and distributes its surpluses – that proved to be the obstacle
preventing capitalism from realizing liberty, equality, brotherhood and
democracy. And by focusing us on the organization of the surplus, Marx
also provided us with the knowledge that the next system must be one in
which the organization of the surplus is democratic, where those who
produce the surplus are identical with those who appropriate it and where
the productive and unproductive laborers together and democratically
decide who gets what portions of the surplus to perform what social
services.

Chapter VII
“The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The
point, however, is to change it.” – Karl Marx
In the closing parts of this essay, we look at Marx’s and Marxists’
suggestions of solutions for the problems of capitalism’s inadequacies.
Marx himself said and wrote little about the future beyond capitalism. He
didn't believe in future-gazing; no one could know how the world would
evolve. Marx gave us some ideas of what might have to happen if we were
going to get beyond capitalism. But he offered no blueprints or road maps.
Later Marxists did not always share these hesitations, especially after
Marxists came to play leading roles in what they called “socialist” societies.
Marx never suggested, contrary to what so many have said, that the state –
the government – had to play some sort of ongoing, central role in what this
future post-capitalist world would look like. Some later Marxists interpreted
him to have suggested that, but it’s hard to find within Marx’s writings any
idea like that. He never wrote a book about the state, because it wasn’t the
center or focus of his analyses. That focus was rather the relationships
among people as they go about producing their existence: relationships such
as master-slave, lord-serf and employer-employee. In each one of those
relationships, a minority of people makes all the key production decisions:
masters, lords, employers. They decide what gets produced, how it gets
produced, where it gets produced, and what is done with the surplus
appropriated from productive workers.
To achieve a society that exhibits liberty, equality, fraternity and
democracy, the object to change first and foremost is production.
There has to be a fundamental change in how production gets done: at the
office, factory, store, or home, wherever work gets done. For Marx, the goal
of such change is to end the dichotomy between a few surplus-appropriators
at the top of the workplace, those who make the key production-related
decisions, and everybody else engaged at that workplace. No more mass of
people producing or enabling a surplus that flows into the hands of a small
surplus-appropriating minority. The goal is a different economic system,
one in which the workplace becomes fundamentally egalitarian and

democratic. The producers of the surplus become identically the
appropriators and distributors of that surplus; exploitation thus ends. The
decisions at the workplace – what, how, and where to produce and how to
distribute the surplus – must be made democratically by productive and
unproductive workers together on the basis of one-person, one-vote.
In this view, democratizing the workplace is how we conceptualize
“doing better” than capitalism.
If you believe in democracy, if you believe that freedom for adults requires
a democratic social environment, then that democracy must include your
workplaces. That is where most adults spend most of their time, or at least
major parts of it. Thus the solution for capitalism’s problems requires
transforming the capitalist workplace. What must go is the top-down,
dichotomized hierarchy of employer at the top, mass of employees at the
bottom. Instead, workplaces become democratic institutions where
everyone has an equal say on what happens there. What must happen to the
economy is like what many democrats have long advocated for politics.
After all, ridding ourselves of kings, czars and emperors proceeded on the
grounds that subjection to a tiny group of people making all basic political
decisions for all of us was unacceptable. The same logic can apply to
economics; indeed that is one way to grasp Marx’s argument.
The democratization of politics has been a mantra, has been a slogan, and
has been a goal for a long time. Marx asks: why only the democratization of
politics? Why not the democratization of the economy?
To go a step further, Marx effectively argues that a genuine political
democracy requires an economic democracy as its ground and partner.
If we permit any economic system to enrich only a few, those rich will use
their wealth to corrupt the political system so it secures their wealth. The
histories of feudalism, slavery and capitalism attest to this truth repeatedly.
Today’s gaudy spectacle of billionaires competing to buy votes is being
lived by every reader of these lines.
One implication of Marx's gesturing towards a different, democratic way of
organizing workplaces is that it will never suffice to go beyond capitalism if
we merely replace private entrepreneurs or private employers with state
officials. Nationalization or socialization of the means of production will

not get us beyond capitalism in so far as it retains the employer versus
employee dichotomy. Over the last hundred years, when state capitalism
has replaced private capitalism, it has led some to refer to such state
capitalism as socialism or even communism. Thus some people refer to
state-run post offices, railway systems or banks as evidence of socialism.
Other people reserved the term socialism for whole societies that instituted
state capitalism as their prevailing economic system such as the USSR, the
People’s Republic of China and so on.
Of course, definitions can and do vary. The point of studying Marx is to be
clear that in his analysis, replacing private capitalist exploiters with state
officials in the parallel relationship with productive and unproductive
workers is not the going beyond capitalism he had in mind in his critique of
capitalism.
Capitalism is superseded when the workplace relationship designated
by the term exploitation ends. That happens when productive laborers
no longer deliver the surpluses they produce into the hands of others
who appropriate and distribute them and make all the key decisions
about those distributions.
Is the realization of Marx's solution merely a utopian dream? I don’t think
so. Indeed, I think many human beings have understood and supported
Marx’s way of thinking. That is why ideas of cooperative, communal, and
other sorts of more democratic workplace organizations have been
discussed and tried repeatedly across human history everywhere. Early
American history had worker cooperatives: workers in farms, stores, small
craft enterprises, getting together in democratic, egalitarian ways. Today,
Spain has a famous example in the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation.
Emilia Romagna in Italy is a place where roughly 40% of businesses are
run as a worker cooperatives, etc.
Marx’s is a more formal and fuller statement of one version of these ideas.
He worked it out a bit further into a modern formulation. Marx teaches it in
a systematic, theoretically sophisticated way. Yet in doing so, he recoups for
us the history of many efforts over many years in virtually all cultures to
move in that direction to achieve a just society.
Marx was a social critic for whom capitalism was not the end of human
history. It was just the latest phase and badly needed the transition to

something better.
Marx’s work can remind us that capitalism’s proponents and celebrants
often make the same mistake as the proponents and celebrants of slavery
and feudalism before them. They imagine wishfully that their system is the
end of history, that their preferred system is as good as it can ever be, that
humankind cannot do better. Every single one of those people has been
proven wrong. Why then believe people who tell us today that we can’t do
better than capitalism? Marx, like many other historians, had noticed that
economic systems such as feudalism, slavery, and all others had histories;
they were born, evolved over time, died and gave way to another system.
By the 1850s, capitalism had shown Marx enough for him to seek its
replacement by something better. His analysis was the fruit of that seeking.
Americans especially now confront serious questions and evidence that our
capitalist system is in trouble. It clearly serves the 1% far, far better than
what it is doing to the vast mass of the people. For a while, mass bitterness,
decline, and anger may be deflected away from the critique of a
dysfunctional economic system. For a while, this anger can be used to
scapegoat immigrants, trade partners, minorities and others among a sadly
familiar set of candidates. But scapegoating has not solved problems. It
does not do so today. Sooner or later, those serious about the problems and
finding solutions will, as they always have, find their way to Marx and the
Marxist tradition as a rich resource. To assist that process is the purpose of
this essay.
